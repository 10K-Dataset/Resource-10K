UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION




February 7, 2014

Fellow Shareholders:

2013 was another tremendous year for Union Pacific, with our overall financial
performance exceeding all previous milestones. The year was a testament to the strength and diversity of our franchise and the dedication and commitment of our employees. We achieved record earnings of $9.42 per share, driven by a best-ever
operating ratio of 66.1 percent. As a result, our return on invested capital* of 14.7 percent also hit an all-time high, while free cash flow* exceeded the $2 billion mark. Shareholders were rewarded with increased financial returns, including a 19
percent increase in dividends declared per share compared to 2012 and $2.2 billion in share repurchases, up 50 percent from 2012. UP’s stock price reached new highs in 2013, increasing 34 percent, and outpaced the S&P 500 by 4 percentage
points.

Despite the challenges from a significantly weaker coal market and the carry-over impact of the 2012 drought on our grain
shipments, other markets within our diverse portfolio of business, including automotive, base chemicals, shale-related moves, construction-related shipments, and domestic intermodal traffic were positive. Operationally, we successfully managed the
shifts in business mix, improved network efficiency and fluidity, and operated a safe railroad.

Excellent service is the key to our
future success. It provides the value that attracts and retains our customers, supports our pricing initiatives, and improves resource utilization. It also demonstrates the power of our value proposition to new customers that are looking for viable
transportation alternatives. But, above all, it is our unrelenting focus on safety that serves as the foundation for everything we do. With our Total Safety Culture and The UP Way instilled throughout the Company, employee injuries hit a near-record
low in 2013. We’re proud of the significant improvement we’ve made, lowering our personal injury rate more than 45 percent over the past decade. As proud as we are of these results, the most important numbers are zero fatalities and zero
injuries, which is our ultimate goal.

Our capital investments play a critical role in meeting the long-term demand for freight
transportation in the U.S. In 2013, we invested $3.6 billion across our network. Over half was spent on replacing and hardening our infrastructure to further enhance safety and reliability. The balance was invested to increase customer value,
support business growth, and continue development of Positive Train Control (PTC), a federally mandated program. Although we achieved best-ever financial returns to support these investments, our returns must continue to improve to support higher
asset replacement costs and our safety, service, and growth initiatives.

In an evolving marketplace, our diverse franchise is
unparalleled in the industry today. Supporting six strong business groups, it remains an absolute core strength of Union Pacific. An increasing U.S. population base will stimulate long-term growth for many of the goods we carry. To meet this growing
demand, we anticipate continued opportunities to convert freight from the highway, supported by our integrated network, competitive service offerings, and environmental advantages. Global population growth will also stimulate world food demand.
Union Pacific plays a vital role in the supply chains for domestic and export grain, supporting our country’s position as the top global corn producer.

With a resurging chemical industry fueled by low natural gas prices and continued strength in the construction and housing markets, Union Pacific’s manifest network is well positioned to meet the growing
demand for various chemical and industrial products. In addition, UP is the only railroad that serves all six major gateways to Mexico. We are in an excellent position to benefit from economic growth in that country. Union Pacific currently touches
more than two-thirds of the goods moving cross-border by rail and is uniquely poised to accommodate forecasted growth in Mexico automotive production and manufacturing activity.

We will build on these strengths and opportunities for profitable growth in the future, while continuing our unrelenting focus on both safety and
service for our customers. We strongly believe in the power and potential of the Union Pacific franchise to drive even greater performance on all fronts and increase shareholder returns in the years to come.

OPERATIONS

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one
reportable operating segment. Although we provide revenue by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. Additional information regarding our business and
operations, including revenue and financial information and data and other information regarding environmental matters, is presented in Risk Factors, Item 1A; Legal Proceedings, Item 3; Selected Financial Data, Item 6;
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7; and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 (which include information regarding revenues, statements of income, and total
assets).



Operations

– UPRR is a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. We have 31,838 route miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and
eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican gateways. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers to move freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific
Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic moves through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders. Our freight traffic consists  
of   bulk,   manifest,   and   premium

2013 Freight Revenue

business. Bulk traffic primarily consists of coal, grain, soda ash, rock and crude oil shipped in unit trains – trains transporting a single commodity
from one source to one destination. Manifest traffic includes individual carload or less than train-load business involving commodities such as lumber, steel, paper, food and chemicals. The transportation of finished vehicles, auto parts, intermodal
containers and truck trailers are included as part of our premium business. In 2013, we generated freight revenues totaling $20.7 billion from the following six commodity groups:

Agricultural

– Transportation of grains, commodities produced from these grains, and food and beverage
products generated 16% of the Railroad’s 2013 freight revenue. The Company accesses most major grain markets, linking the Midwest and western U.S. producing areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast ports, as well as
Mexico. We also serve significant domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders and ethanol producers in the Midwest, West, South and Rocky Mountain states. Unit trains, which transport a single commodity between producers and export
terminals or domestic markets, represent approximately 36% of our agricultural shipments.

Automotive

– We are the largest
automotive carrier west of the Mississippi River and operate or access over 40 vehicle distribution centers. The Railroad’s extensive franchise serves vehicle assembly plants and connects to West Coast ports and the Gulf of Mexico to
accommodate both import and export shipments. In addition to transporting finished vehicles, UP provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. The automotive group
generated 10% of Union Pacific’s freight revenue in 2013.

Chemicals

– Transporting chemicals generated 17% of our
freight revenue in 2013. The Railroad’s unique franchise serves the chemical producing areas along the Gulf Coast, where roughly two-thirds of the Company’s chemical business originates, terminates or travels. Our chemical franchise also
accesses chemical producers in the Rocky Mountains and on the West Coast. The Company’s chemical shipments include four broad categories: Petrochemicals, Fertilizer, Soda Ash, and Other. Petrochemicals include industrial chemicals, plastics and
petroleum products, including crude oil and liquid petroleum gases. Currently, these products move primarily to and from the Gulf Coast region. Fertilizer movements originate in the Gulf Coast region, the western U.S. and Canada (through interline
access) for delivery to major agricultural users in the Midwest, western U.S., as well as abroad. Soda ash originates in southwestern Wyoming and California, destined for chemical and glass producing markets in North America and abroad. Other
shipments include sodium products, phosphorus rock and sulfur.

Coal

– Shipments of coal and petroleum coke accounted for
19% of our freight revenue in 2013. The Railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal and petroleum coke to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the U.S. Through interchange gateways and ports,
UP’s reach extends to eastern U.S. utilities, Mexico, Europe and Asia. Water terminals allow the Railroad to move western U.S. coal east via the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, as well as the Great Lakes. Export coal moves through West Coast ports
to Asia and through the Mississippi River and Houston to Europe. Coal traffic originating in the Southern Powder River Basin (SPRB) area of Wyoming is the largest segment of UP’s coal business.

Industrial Products

– Our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and
destination points throughout North America. The Industrial Products group consists of several categories, including construction products, minerals, consumer goods, metals,



lumber, paper, and other miscellaneous products. In 2013, this group generated 18% of Union Pacific’s total freight revenue. Commercial, residential and governmental infrastructure
investments drive shipments of steel, aggregates (cement components), cement and wood products. Oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel, finished pipe, frac sand, stone and drilling fluid commodities. Industrial and light manufacturing
plants receive steel, nonferrous materials, minerals and other raw materials. Paper and packaging commodities, as well as appliances, move to major metropolitan areas for consumers. Lumber shipments originate primarily in the Pacific Northwest and
western Canada and move throughout the U.S. for use in new home construction and repair and remodeling.

Intermodal

– Our
Intermodal business includes two segments: international and domestic. International business consists of import and export container traffic that mainly passes through West Coast ports served by UP’s extensive terminal network. Domestic
business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within North America for intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and logistics companies), as well as truckload carriers. Less-than-truckload and package
carriers with time-sensitive business requirements are also an important part of domestic shipments. Together, international and domestic business generated 20% of UP’s 2013 freight revenue.

Seasonality

– Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity, such
as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons, and the demand cycle for the commodity, such as intermodal traffic, which generally has a peak shipping season during the third quarter to meet
holiday-related demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter. The peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably from year to year depending upon various factors, including the strength of domestic and international
economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products. In response to an annual request delivered by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to all of the
Class I railroads operating in the U.S., we issue a publicly available letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the STB.

Working Capital

– At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had a modest working capital surplus, which provides enhanced liquidity. In
addition, we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.

Competition

– We are subject to competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Our main
railroad competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC. Its primary subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor
carriers. Motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups (excluding most coal shipments). Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and Gulf Coast waterways, barges can be particularly competitive, especially for
grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in
particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service. However, railroads are much more fuel efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public
infrastructure, and railroads operating in the U.S., including us, have been making efforts to convert certain traffic from motor carriers to railroad service. Additionally, we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system; trucks and barges
are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities: (i) improvements or expenditures materially
increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, (ii) legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (iii) legislation or
regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. For more information regarding risks we face from competition, see the Risk Factors in Item 1A of
this report.

Key Suppliers

– We depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives. Due to the capital
intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment, potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing
locomotives for any reason, including insolvency or bankruptcy, we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations. Additionally, for a high percentage of our rail
purchases, we utilize two steel



producers (one domestic and one international) that meet our specifications. Rail is critical for both maintenance of our network and replacement and improvement or expansion of our network and
facilities. Rail manufacturing also has high barriers of entry, and, if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason, including insolvency or bankruptcy, we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail.

Employees

– Approximately 86% of our 46,445 full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. In 2012, we
concluded the most recent round of negotiations, which began in 2010, with the ratification of new agreements by several unions. All of the unions executed similar multi-year agreements that provide for higher employee cost sharing of employee
health and welfare benefits and higher wages. The current agreements will remain in effect until renegotiated under provisions of the Railway Labor Act. The next round of negotiations will begin in early 2015.

Railroad Security

– Our security efforts rely upon a wide variety of measures including employee training, cooperation with our
customers, training of emergency responders, and partnerships with numerous federal, state, and local government agencies. While federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and
other security incidents, the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives.

UPRR Security Measures

–
We maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and to respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise. The plan includes four levels of alert status, each with its own set of countermeasures. We employ our own police
force, consisting of more than 200 commissioned and highly-trained officers. Our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training, as well as federally-mandated hazardous materials and security training. We regularly review the
sufficiency of our employee training programs. We maintain the capability to move critical operations to back-up facilities in different locations.

We have an emergency response management center, which operates 24 hours a day. The center receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from
our employees, the public, and law enforcement and other government officials. In cooperation with government officials, we monitor both threats and public events, and, as necessary, we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize
risk to communities and our operations. We comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law. We also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the
time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers. Additionally, in compliance with Transportation Security Agency regulations, we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and
documenting the handoff of Rail Security Sensitive Material with customers and interchange partners.

We also have established a number
of our own innovative safety and security-oriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to The Officer on the Train program, which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance
their understanding of railroad operations and risks. Our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment. To date,
we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us.

Cooperation with
Federal, State, and Local Government Agencies

– We work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies that include the DOT and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as well as local police departments, fire
departments, and other first responders. In conjunction with DOT, DHS, and other railroads, we sponsor Operation Respond, which provides first responders with secure links to electronic railroad resources, including mapping systems, shipment
records, and other essential information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations. We also participate in the National Joint Terrorism Task Force, a multi-agency effort established by the U.S. Department of
Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to combat and prevent terrorism.

We work with the Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (CBP), and the Military Transport Management Command, which monitor shipments entering the UPRR rail network at U.S. border crossings and ports. We were the first railroad in the U.S. to be named a partner in CBP’s
Customs-



Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, a partnership designed to develop, enhance, and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain.

Cooperation with Customers and Trade Associations

– Along with other railroads, we work with the American Chemistry Council to train
approximately 200,000 emergency responders annually. We work with many of our chemical shippers to establish plant security plans, and we continue to take steps to more closely monitor and track hazardous materials shipments. In cooperation with the
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and other interested groups, we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials.

GOVERNMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Governmental Regulation

– Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations, generally applicable to all
businesses. (See also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in Legal Proceedings, Item 3.)

The operations of the
Railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the STB. The STB has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic; common carrier service of regulated traffic; freight car compensation; transfer, extension, or
abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of rail common carriers. In 2013, the STB continued its efforts to explore whether to expand rail regulation. The STB has requested parties to submit studies that describe and quantify the
potential impact of expanded reciprocal switching or trackage rights arrangements on railroads. For the past several legislative sessions, proposed bills have been introduced in Congress that aim to alter the regulatory structure of the railroad
industry. We will continue to monitor any legislative activity involving rail and transportation regulation and respond accordingly.

The operations of the Railroad also are subject to the regulations of the FRA and other federal and state agencies. On January 12, 2010, the
FRA issued initial rules governing installation of Positive Train Control (PTC) by the end of 2015. The final regulation is still forthcoming. Although still under development, PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override engineer
controlled locomotives and stop a train before an accident. Following the issuance of the initial rules, the FRA acknowledged that projected costs will exceed projected benefits by a ratio of at least 22 to one, and we estimate that our costs will
be higher than those assumed by the FRA. In August 2012, the FRA provided Congress with a status report regarding implementation of PTC. This report indicated that the rail industry will likely achieve only partial deployment of PTC by the current
deadline due to significant technical and other issues. Through 2013, we have invested over $1.2 billion in the development of PTC.

DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and DHS, along with other federal
agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, among other things, revised hours of service
rules for train and certain other railroad employees, mandated implementation of PTC, imposed passenger service requirements, addressed safety at rail crossings, increased the number of safety related employees of the FRA, and increased fines that
may be levied against railroads for safety violations. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.

Environmental Regulation

– We are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining
to public health and the environment. The statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by various state environmental agencies. The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act,
regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating waste water discharges.

Information concerning environmental claims and
contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7 and Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The information set forth in this Item 1A should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report, including
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7, and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.

We Must Manage Fluctuating Demand for Our Services and Network Capacity

– If there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network, we may experience network
difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity, that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers. This level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weather-related events on our operations and velocity.
Although we continue to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, improve operations at our yards and other facilities, and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources, we cannot be sure that these
measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity. We may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity, dramatic and unplanned increases or
decreases of demand for rail service with respect to one or more of our commodity groups or operating regions, or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In the event that we experience significant reductions of demand for rail services with respect to one or more of our commodity groups, we may experience increased costs associated with
resizing our operations, including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives, rail cars, and other equipment; work-force adjustments; and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We Transport Hazardous Materials

– We transport certain hazardous
materials and other materials, including crude oil and toxic inhalation hazard (TIH) materials, such as chlorine, that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion. Additionally, U.S. laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads
that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss. A rail accident or other incident or accident on our network, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release
or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We Are Subject to Significant Governmental
Regulation

– We are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state, and local authorities covering a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, economic (as discussed below), and other matters. Many laws
and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a
material adverse effect on us. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business, including, without limitation,
regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution, business relationships with other railroads, calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy, the prices we charge, and costs and
expenses. Significant legislative activity in Congress or regulatory activity by the STB could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment
and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. As part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, rail carriers must currently implement PTC by the end of 2015, which could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to make other capital investments. Rail carriers likely will not meet the current mandatory deadline for PTC implementation due to various factors. Additionally, one or more consolidations of Class I railroads could
also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry.

We May Be Affected by General Economic Conditions

– Prolonged
severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our
results of operations and financial condition.

We Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers

– We face competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service. While we must build or



acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks, barges and maritime operators are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially
increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the burden of the size or weight limitations currently applicable to motor carriers, could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate.

Severe Weather Could Result in Significant Business Interruptions and Expenditures

– As a railroad with a vast network, we are exposed
to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures, and significant precipitation that may cause business interruptions, including line outages on
our rail network, that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and
liquidity.

We Rely on Technology and Technology Improvements in Our Business Operations

– We rely on information technology
in all aspects of our business. If we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as PTC or the latest version of our transportation control systems, we may suffer a
competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, if a
cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could suffer a significant service interruption,
safety failure, security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures

– As a railroad with operations in
densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network, we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, environmental liability, and other matters.
Any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We Are Subject to Significant
Environmental Laws and Regulations

– Due to the nature of the railroad business, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air;
discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and hazardous material or petroleum releases. We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations, and we did so in our
former operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties we currently own. Environmental liabilities have arisen and may also
arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. We
currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation, remediation and monitoring, and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future. Liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and,
as necessary, the advice and assistance of our consultants. However, actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors, including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws, technological changes
affecting investigations and remediation, the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to correction actions required to remediate any existing or future sites. We
could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown, or future environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We May Be Affected by Climate Change and Market or Regulatory
Responses to Climate Change

– Climate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on
emissions of greenhouse gasses, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that (a) use commodities that we carry



to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (c) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of
energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to
alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government
incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for
example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. Finally, we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our
operations on climate change. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Strikes or Work Stoppages Could Adversely Affect Our Operations as
the Majority of Our Employees Belong to Labor Unions and Labor Agreements

– The U.S. Class I railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our
potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise our service reliability or
significantly increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

The Availability of Qualified Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Operations

– Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the
availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact
on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Rising or Elevated Fuel Costs and Our Ability to Mitigate These Costs with Fuel Surcharges

– Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses. Diesel fuel prices can be subject
to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel
surcharges, we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. Additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to
apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges. International, political, and economic factors, events and conditions affect fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic
refining capacity. A severe shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We Utilize Capital Markets

– Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient
railroad, we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements. We utilize long-term debt instruments, bank financing and commercial paper from time-to-time, and we pledge certain of our receivables. Significant instability or
disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to, and significantly increase the cost of, commercial paper and
other financing sources, including bank credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt, including corporate bonds. A significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment
grade, which could restrict, or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us, from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility. This may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase
the costs of short and long-term debt financing.

A Significant Portion of Our Revenue Involves Transportation of Commodities to and
from International Markets

– Although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the United States, a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and



from international markets, including Mexico and Southeast Asia, by various carriers and, at times, various modes of transportation. Significant and sustained interruptions of trade with Mexico
or countries in Southeast Asia, including China, could adversely affect customers and other entities that, directly or indirectly, purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the U.S. as part of their operations, and any such interruptions
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with Mexico or countries in Southeast Asia: a
deterioration of security for international trade and businesses; the adverse impact of new laws, rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws, rules and regulations by government entities, courts or regulatory bodies, including taxing
authorities, that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries; any significant adverse economic developments, such as extended periods of high inflation, material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these
foreign countries, and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports; shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and
export markets; and a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries.

We Are Subject to Legislative, Regulatory,
and Legal Developments Involving Taxes

– Taxes are a significant part of our expenses. We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income, payroll, property, sales and use, fuel, and other types of taxes. Changes in tax rates,
enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity.

We Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail

– Due to the capital intensive
nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment, potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry. Therefore, if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason, including
bankruptcy or insolvency, we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations. Additionally, for a high percentage of our rail purchases, we utilize two steel producers
(one domestic and one international) that meet our specifications. Rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs, maintenance, and for adding additional network capacity, new rail and storage yards, and expansions of existing
facilities. This industry similarly has high barriers to entry, and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency, we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and
difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects.

We May Be Affected by Acts of Terrorism, War, or Risk of
War

– Our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, including rail cars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Terrorist attacks, or other similar events, any government response
thereto, and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not be
available to us in the future.

Item 2.

Properties

We employ a variety of assets in the management and operation of our rail business. Our rail network covers 23 states in the western two-thirds of
the U.S.

TRACK

Our rail network includes 31,838 route miles. We own 26,009 miles and operate on the remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases. The following
table describes track miles at December 31, 2013 and 2012.

HEADQUARTERS BUILDING

We maintain our headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. The facility has 1.2 million square feet of space for approximately 4,000 employees and is subject to a financing arrangement.

HARRIMAN DISPATCHING CENTER

The Harriman
Dispatching Center (HDC), located in Omaha, Nebraska, is our primary dispatching facility. It is linked to regional dispatching and locomotive management facilities at various locations along our



network. HDC employees coordinate moves of locomotives and trains, manage traffic and train crews on our network, and coordinate interchanges with other railroads. Approximately 850 employees
currently work on-site in the facility. In the event of a disruption of operations at HDC due to a cyber attack, flooding or severe weather or other event, we maintain the capability to conduct critical operations at back-up facilities in different
locations.

RAIL FACILITIES

In
addition to our track structure, we operate numerous facilities, including terminals for intermodal and other freight; rail yards for train-building (classification yards), switching, storage-in-transit (the temporary storage of customer goods in
rail cars prior to shipment) and other activities; offices to administer and manage our operations; dispatching centers to direct traffic on our rail network; crew quarters to house train crews along our network; and shops and other facilities for
fueling, maintenance, and repair of locomotives and repair and maintenance of rail cars and other equipment. The following tables include the major yards and terminals on our system:

RAIL EQUIPMENT

Our equipment includes owned and leased locomotives and rail cars; heavy maintenance equipment and machinery; other equipment and tools in our shops, offices, and facilities; and vehicles for maintenance,
transportation of crews, and other activities. As of December 31, 2013, we owned or leased the following units of equipment:



CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Our rail network requires significant annual capital investments for replacement, improvement, and expansion. These investments enhance safety, support the transportation needs of our customers, and improve our
operational efficiency. Additionally, we add new locomotives and freight cars to our fleet to replace older, less efficient equipment, to support growth and customer demand, and to reduce our impact on the environment through the acquisition of more
fuel efficient and low-emission locomotives.

2013 Capital Expenditures

– During 2013, we made cash and non-cash capital
investments totaling $3.6 billion. (See the cash capital expenditures table in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financial Condition,
Item 7.)

2014 Capital Expenditures

– In 2014, we expect to make capital investments of approximately $3.9 billion,
which will include expenditures for PTC of approximately $450 million and may include non-cash investments. We may revise our 2014 capital plan if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient
returns on these investments. (See discussion of our 2014 capital plan in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – 2014 Outlook, Item 7.)

OTHER

Equipment Encumbrances

–
Equipment with a carrying value of approximately $2.9 billion at both December 31, 2013, and 2012 served as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to
acquire or refinance such railroad equipment.

As a result of the merger of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MPRR) with and into UPRR
on January 1, 1997, and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the MPRR mortgage bonds, UPRR must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds. As of the merger
date, the value of the MPRR assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately $6.0 billion. In accordance with the terms of the indentures, this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of
the outstanding balance of such bonds.

Environmental Matters

– Certain of our properties are subject to federal, state, and
local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. (See discussion of environmental issues in Business – Governmental and Environmental Regulation, Item 1, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7.)



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation that occur in connection with our business. We routinely assess our
liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and, when necessary, we seek input from our third-party advisors when making these assessments. Consistent with SEC rules and requirements, we
describe below material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business), material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, other proceedings arising under federal, state, or
local environmental laws and regulations (including governmental proceedings involving potential fines, penalties, or other monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000), and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As
previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2012, the Illinois Attorney General’s Office notified UPRR on January 14, 2013, that it will seek a penalty against the Railroad for environmental conditions caused by its
predecessor at a former locomotive fueling facility in South Pekin, Illinois. This former CNW facility discontinued fueling operations in the early 1980s. Subsequent environmental investigation revealed evidence of fuel releases to soil and
groundwater. In January 2007, the State rejected UPRR’s proposed compliance commitment agreement and responded with a notice of intent to pursue legal action. UPRR continued to perform remedial investigations under the supervision of the
Illinois EPA. In June 2012, the Illinois EPA approved UPRR’s proposed remedial action plan for the contamination. Although no further action is required for the contamination, the State is now seeking to recover a penalty. The State offered to
settle the matter prior to litigation for payment of a $240,000 penalty. UPRR rejected that offer, and the state sued UPRR on October 26, 2013 in the Circuit Court for the Tenth Judicial Circuit, Tazewell County, Illinois. UPRR will vigorously
defend against the allegations in the complaint. Although the complaint does not state an amount for the proposed penalty, any penalty, whether payable by settlement or following an unsuccessful defense of the claim, may exceed $100,000.

We received notices from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws
for remediation costs at various sites throughout the U.S., including sites on the Superfund National Priorities List or state superfund lists. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially
responsible parties involved, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs.

Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7.

OTHER MATTERS

Antitrust Litigation

– As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, 20
rail shippers (many of whom are represented by the same law firms) filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other Class I railroads in the U.S. Currently, UPRR and three other Class I
railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuit. The original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey on May 14, 2007. The number of complaints reached a total of 30. These suits allege that the
named railroads engaged in price-fixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic.

In addition to suits filed by
direct purchasers of rail transportation, a few of the suits involved plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and sought to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation that
paid fuel surcharges. These complaints added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws. On November 6, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to
Judge Paul Friedman of the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. Following numerous hearings and rulings, Judge Friedman dismissed the complaints of the indirect purchasers, which the
indirect purchasers appealed. On April 16, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed Judge Friedman’s ruling dismissing the indirect purchasers’ claims based on various state laws.



With respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint, Judge Friedman conducted a two-day hearing on
October 6 and 7, 2010, on the class certification issue and the railroad defendants’ motion to exclude evidence of interline communications. On April 7, 2011, Judge Friedman issued an order deferring any decision on class
certification until the Supreme Court issued its decision in the Wal-Mart employment discrimination case.

On June 21, 2012, Judge
Friedman issued his decision, which certified a class of plaintiffs with eight named plaintiff representatives. The decision included in the class all shippers that paid a rate-based fuel surcharge to any one of the defendant railroads for
rate-unregulated rail transportation from July 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008. This was a procedural ruling, which did not affirm any of the claims asserted by the plaintiffs and does not affect the ability of the railroad defendants
to disprove the allegations made by the plaintiffs. On July 5, 2012, the defendant railroads filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia requesting that the court review the class certification ruling. On
August 28, 2012, a panel of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia referred the petition to a merits panel of the court to address the issues in the petition and to address whether the district court properly granted class certification.
The Circuit Court heard oral arguments on May 3, 2013. On August 9, 2013, the Circuit Court vacated the class certification decision and remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the class certification decision in light of a
recent Supreme Court case and incomplete consideration of errors in the expert report of the plaintiffs. On October 31, 2013, Judge Friedman approved a schedule agreed to by all parties for consideration of the class certification issue on
remand. The schedule, which includes dates for briefs, expert reports and depositions, concludes in June 2014. The court has not set a date for hearing arguments on the class certification issue or any other aspect of this litigation.

As we reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on June 10, 2011, the Railroad received a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court
for the District of Columbia on June 7, 2011, by Oxbow Carbon & Minerals LLC and related entities (Oxbow). The complaint named the Railroad and one other U.S. Class I Railroad as defendants and alleged that the named railroads engaged
in price-fixing and monopolistic practices in connection with fuel surcharge programs and pricing of shipments of certain commodities, including coal and petroleum coke. The complaint sought injunctive relief and payment of damages of over $30
million, and other unspecified damages, including treble damages. Some of the allegations in the complaint were addressed in the existing fuel surcharge litigation referenced above. The complaint also included additional unrelated allegations
regarding alleged limitations on competition for shipments of Oxbow’s commodities. Judge Friedman, who presides over the fuel surcharge matter described above, also presides over this matter. On February 26, 2013, Judge Friedman granted
the defendants’ motion to dismiss Oxbow’s complaint for failure to state properly a claim under the antitrust laws. However, the dismissal was without prejudice to refile the complaint. Judge Friedman approved a schedule that allowed Oxbow
to file a revised complaint, which Oxbow filed on May 1, 2013. The amended complaint alleges that UPRR and one other Class I railroad violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and that UPRR also breached a tolling agreement between
Oxbow and UPRR. Oxbow claims that it paid more than $50 million in wrongfully imposed fuel surcharges. UPRR and the other railroad filed separate motions to dismiss the Oxbow revised complaint on July 1, 2013.

We deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws. We believe that these lawsuits are without
merit, and we will vigorously defend our actions. Therefore, we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “UNP”. The following table presents the dividends
declared and the high and low prices of our common stock for each of the indicated quarters.

At January 31, 2014, there were 455,057,609 shares of common stock outstanding and 31,914 common shareholders
of record. On that date, the closing price of the common stock on the NYSE was $174.24. We have paid dividends to our common shareholders during each of the past 114 years. We declared dividends totaling $1,371 million in 2013 and $1,180 million in
2012. On August 1, 2013, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.79 per share, payable on October 1, 2013, to shareholders of record on August 30, 2013. On February 6, 2014, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.91 per
share, payable on April 1, 2014, to shareholders of record on February 28, 2014. We are subject to certain restrictions regarding retained earnings with respect to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained
earnings available for dividends increased to $16.3 billion at December 31, 2013, from $15.1 billion at December 31, 2012. (See discussion of this restriction in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources, Item 7.) We do not believe the restriction on retained earnings will affect our ability to pay dividends, and we currently expect to pay dividends in 2014.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
applicable notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and other information in this report, including Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A and Critical Accounting Policies and Cautionary Information at the end of this
Item 7.

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. Although revenue is
analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2013 Results

•

Safety

– During 2013, we continued focusing on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees, our customers and the public. Our
sustained efforts to improve crossing warning systems and, where possible, close at-grade crossings reduced grade crossing incidents per million train miles by 7% during the year. We closed 212 grade crossings in 2013 to reduce our exposure to
incidents and continued using video cameras on our locomotives to analyze safety incidents. Although reportable personal injury incidents per 200,000 employee hours increased 4% from last year’s record low, it is our second lowest year and a 9%
decline from 2011. Our reportable derailment incidents per million train miles increased slightly, less than 1%, from 2012. These results demonstrate our continued development and expansion of our safety programs and initiatives, including Courage
to Care, Total Safety Culture, and Standard Work.

•

Financial Performance –

In 2013, we generated operating income of $7.4 billion, a 10% increase over 2012. Core pricing gains of 3.6% along with
our ongoing focus on safety, service, network efficiency and productivity drove record financial results for the year. Our operating ratio for 2013 of 66.1% was an all-time best, improving from last year’s operating ratio of 67.8%. Net income
of $4.4 billion surpassed our previous milestone set in 2012, translating into earnings of $9.42 per diluted share for 2013.

•

Freight Revenues

– Our freight revenues grew 5% year-over-year to $20.7 billion. Freight revenues for five of the six commodity groups increased
despite flat volume. Volume growth in shale-related products (crude oil and frac sand), automotive and domestic intermodal offset declines in coal, international intermodal and agricultural products. Core pricing gains, an automotive logistics
management arrangement and shifts in business mix all resulted in higher average revenue per car (ARC), which drove the growth in freight revenue in 2013 compared to 2012. Our fuel surcharge was essentially flat versus 2012, as lower fuel price
offset improved fuel recovery provisions and the lag effect of our programs (surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months).

•

Network Operations

– In 2013, despite challenging weather and significant shifts in our business mix, our operations remained efficient and fluid.
As reported to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), average train speed declined 2% in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting severe weather conditions and shifts of traffic to sections of our network with higher utilization. Average terminal
dwell time increased 3% primarily due to continuing growth of manifest traffic, which requires more time in terminals for switching cars and building trains.

•

Fuel Prices

– In 2013, the average price per barrel of crude oil increased from 2012. However, the average price per gallon of diesel fuel that we
paid in 2013 decreased 2% from the average price in 2012, as lower crude oil to diesel conversion spreads in 2013 more than offset the higher price for crude oil. The lower price decreased operating expenses by $75 million (excluding any impact from
year-over-year volume). A 1% decline in gross-ton miles also drove lower fuel expense. Our fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles, increased 2% compared to 2012 partially offsetting the decreases.
Declines in heavier, more fuel-efficient coal shipments drove the gross-ton-mile and fuel consumption rate variances.

•

Free Cash Flow

– Cash generated by operating activities totaled $6.8 billion, yielding record free cash flow of $2.1 billion after reductions of
$3.4 billion for cash used in investing activities and a 16%



increase in dividends paid. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid.

Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) by SEC
Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures
our ability to generate cash without additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by
operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):

2014 Outlook

•

Safety

– Operating a safe railroad benefits our employees, our customers, our shareholders, and the communities we serve. We will continue using a
multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, quality control, training and employee engagement, and targeted capital investments. We will continue using and expanding the deployment of Total Safety Culture and Courage to
Care throughout our operations, which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. Derailment prevention and the reduction of grade crossing incidents are also critical aspects of our safety programs. We
will continue our efforts to increase detection of rail defects; improve or close crossings; and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies),
various industry programs and local community activities across our network.

•

Network Operations

– We believe the Railroad is capable of handling growing volumes while providing high levels of customer service. Our track
structure is in excellent condition, and certain sections of our network have surplus line and terminal capacity. We are in a solid resource position, with sufficient supplies of locomotives, freight cars and crews to support growth.

•

Fuel Prices

– Uncertainty about the economy makes projections of fuel prices difficult. We again could see volatile fuel prices during the year,
as they are sensitive to global and U.S. domestic demand, refining capacity, geopolitical events, weather conditions and other factors. To reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings, we will continue seeking cost recovery from our customers through
our fuel surcharge programs and expanding our fuel conservation efforts.

•

Capital Plan

– In 2014, we plan to make total capital investments of approximately $3.9 billion, including expenditures for Positive Train Control
(PTC), which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments. (See further discussion in this Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources –
Capital Plan.)

•

Positive Train Control

– In response to a legislative mandate to implement PTC by the end of 2015, we have invested $1.2 billion in capital
expenditures and plan to spend an additional $450 million during 2014 on developing and deploying PTC. We currently estimate that PTC, in accordance with implementing rules issued by the Federal Rail Administration (FRA), will cost us approximately
$2 billion by the end of the project. This includes costs for installing the new system along our tracks, upgrading locomotives to work with the new system, and adding digital data communication equipment to integrate the various components of the
system and achieve interoperability for the industry. Although it is unlikely that the rail industry will meet the current mandatory 2015 deadline (as the FRA indicated in its 2012 report to Congress), we are making a good faith effort to do so and
we are working closely with regulators as we implement this new technology.



•

Financial Expectations

– We are cautious about the economic environment, but, assuming that industrial production grows approximately 3% as
projected, volume should exceed 2013 levels. Even with no volume growth, we expect earnings to exceed 2013 earnings, generated by core pricing gains, on-going network improvements and productivity initiatives. We expect that free cash flow for 2014
will be lower than 2013 as higher cash from operations will be more than offset by additional cash of approximately $400 million that will be used to pay income taxes that were previously deferred through bonus depreciation, increased capital spend
and higher dividend payments.

We generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups. Freight
revenues vary with volume (carloads) and ARC. Changes in price, traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive ARC. We provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from
specific locations, which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments. We recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination. We allocate freight revenues between reporting
periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them.

Other revenues include
revenues earned by our subsidiaries, revenues from our commuter rail operations, and accessorial revenues, which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage.
We recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations.

Freight revenues from five of our six commodity
groups increased during 2013 compared to 2012. Revenue from agricultural products was down slightly compared to 2012. ARC increased 5%, driven by core pricing gains, shifts in business mix and an automotive logistics management arrangement. Volume
was essentially flat year over year as growth in automotives, frac sand, crude oil and domestic intermodal offset declines in coal, international intermodal and grain shipments.

Freight revenues from four of our six commodity groups increased during 2012 compared to 2011. Revenues from coal and agricultural products
declined during the year. Our franchise diversity allowed us to take advantage of growth from shale-related markets (crude oil, frac sand and pipe) and strong automotive manufacturing, which offset volume declines from coal and agricultural
products. ARC increased 7%, driven by core pricing gains and higher fuel cost recoveries. Improved fuel recovery provisions and higher fuel prices, including the lag effect of our programs (surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by
approximately two months), combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges.

Our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues
of $2.6 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.2 billion in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Fuel surcharge in 2013 was essentially flat versus 2012 as lower fuel price offset improved fuel recovery provisions and the lag effect of our programs
(surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months). Rising fuel prices and more shipments subject to fuel surcharges drove the increase from 2011 to 2012.

In 2013, other revenue increased from 2012 due primarily to miscellaneous contract revenue and higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker
intermodal and automotive services.

In 2012, other revenues increased from 2011 due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries
that broker intermodal and automotive services. Assessorial revenues also increased in 2012 due to container revenue related to an increase in intermodal shipments.



The following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in freight revenues, revenue carloads, and
ARC by commodity type:

[a]

Each intermodal container or trailer equals one carload.

Agricultural Products –

Lower volume offset price improvements as freight revenue declined slightly versus 2012. In
the fourth quarter grain shipments increased 41% due to a robust fall harvest. Despite the fourth quarter growth, grain shipments still decreased 4% for the full year when compared to 2012, reflecting the impact of the severe drought in 2012 that
affected territory served by us during the first three quarters of 2013. Export wheat shipped to the Gulf and Pacific Northwest increased in the second half of 2013, partially offsetting the declines in grain.

Lower   volume  more   than  offset
 pricing gains

2013 Agricultural Carloads

and increased fuel surcharges as agricultural freight revenue decreased in 2012 versus 2011. Weak export demand for
U.S. wheat drove a 19% decrease in wheat shipments year over year, as the foreign wheat market improved significantly from the weather affected crop in 2011. In addition, corn shipments declined 11% for the year, with more significant declines in
the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of the severe drought across the U.S. Lower gasoline demand, reduced exports and higher corn prices decreased ethanol shipments during the second half of the year. Growth in imported beer from Mexico and a
strong domestic harvest of fresh potatoes partially offset these declines.



Automotive –

Higher ARC due to price increases and the logistics management arrangement that covers fees and container
costs, coupled with increased shipments of automotive parts and finished vehicles, improved automotive revenue in 2013 compared to 2012. Higher production and sales levels during 2013 drove the volume growth.

In 2012, stronger shipments of finished vehicles and automotive
parts along with pricing gains and higher fuel surcharges improved automotive freight revenue from 2011 levels. Higher production and sales levels drove the volume growth. In addition, 2012 shipments compared favorably to 2011 due to lower shipments
of international vehicles in 2011 following the disaster in Japan.

2013 Automotive Carloads

Chemicals –

Volume gains and price improvement increased freight revenue from chemicals in 2013 versus 2012. Shipments
of crude oil from the Bakken, Permian, Niobrara and Eagle Ford shale formations primarily to the Gulf area drove the growth in shipments of chemicals. In addition, shipments of industrial chemicals increased as manufacturing, housing and automotive
markets improved.

Higher volume, price improvements
and fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from chemicals in 2012. Shipments of crude oil primarily from the Bakken, Permian and Eagle Ford Shale formations to the Gulf area  increased  over  three
 fold,  driving  the

2013 Chemicals Carloads

improvement in chemicals shipments. In addition, plastics and industrial chemicals shipments increased as low
natural gas prices have made U.S. chemicals more cost competitive globally. Declines in potash due to temporary shutdowns and reduced production at several mines partially offset the increases in chemical shipments during the year.

Coal –

ARC gains driven by price increases and positive business mix partially offset by volume declines increased freight revenue from coal shipments in 2013
versus 2012. Southern Powder River Basin (SPRB) shipments declined 10% from 2012 due to the loss of a customer contract at the beginning of the year, relatively mild summer weather, and tighter coal inventory management by utilities. Shipments from
Colorado and Utah mines decreased 13% compared to 2012, driven by soft domestic demand and mine production issues, partially offset by second half growth in international shipments. Severe flooding and washouts in Colorado also reduced volumes from
certain producers in the third quarter.

2013 Coal Carloads

Lower volume, partially offset by pricing gains and fuel surcharge recoveries reduced freight revenue from coal
shipments in 2012 compared to 2011. Shipments of coal from the Southern Powder River Basin (SPRB) mines decreased 15% from 2011. Above average coal stockpiles due to an unseasonably warm winter and low natural gas prices, which caused some
displacement of coal in electricity production, led to



the volume declines. In addition, the loss of two contracts to a competitor contributed to lower volumes from the SPRB. Coal shipments from the Colorado and Utah mines increased 2% versus 2011.
Increased export shipments of Colorado and Utah coal in 2012 offset the domestic declines due to higher stockpiles and low natural gas prices.

Industrial Products

– Freight revenue from industrial products increased in 2013 versus 2012 driven by volume growth
and higher ARC due to pricing gains and favorable business mix. Shipments of non-metallic minerals (primarily frac sand) grew as a result of drilling activity for energy products. Additionally, growth in new housing construction and home
improvements drove an increase in lumber shipments. Declines in ferrous scrap and government shipments partially offset these higher volumes.

Pricing improvement, higher volume and additional fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from industrial products  in  2012
 versus

2013 Industrial Products Carloads

2011. Shipments of non-metallic minerals (primarily frac sand), grew in response to increased horizontal drilling
activity for energy products. More construction activity during a relatively mild winter led to higher demand for shipments of lumber, cement and stone compared to 2011. The growth in housing starts throughout 2012 also increased lumber shipments,
up 12% from 2011. Steel shipments finished slightly down from 2011 levels as lower demand for export scrap and mine production issues in the second half of the year offset increases in the first half due to higher demand for steel coils and plate
for pipe and auto production.

Intermodal

– Pricing improvements and slight volume growth drove increased freight revenue from intermodal shipments
in 2013 compared to 2012. Domestic traffic increased 3% due to conversions from truck transportation to rail. International traffic declined 2% versus 2012, reflecting market share shifts within the ocean carrier industry and an increase in
transloading in the second half of the year. Transloading involves the transfer of goods from international to domestic containers at distribution centers near West coast ports, which reduces demand for rail transportation to these
centers.

Higher fuel surcharges, including improved
fuel

2013 Intermodal Carloads

recovery provisions, core pricing gains and volume growth increased freight revenue from intermodal shipments in
2012. Volume levels from international traffic remained flat year-over-year as the loss of a customer contract in the first half of the year offset modest West Coast import growth. Domestic traffic increased 3% versus 2011 due to better market
conditions and continued conversion of traffic from truck to rail.

Mexico Business

– Each of our commodity groups includes
revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Revenue from Mexico business increased 9% to $2.1 billion in 2013 versus 2012. Shipments were up 3% versus 2012, all commodity groups grew with the exception of agricultural products. The largest growth
came from automotive and industrial products shipments.

Revenue from Mexico business increased 8% to $1.9 billion in 2012 versus 2011.
Volume levels for four of the six commodity groups (industrial products and agricultural products declined), were up 5% in aggregate versus 2011, with particularly strong growth in automotive and intermodal shipments.



Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased $336 million in 2013 versus 2012. Wage and benefit inflation, new logistics management fees and
container costs for our automotive business, locomotive overhauls, property taxes and repairs on jointly owned property contributed to higher expenses during the year. Lower fuel prices partially offset the cost increases.

Operating expenses increased $348 million in 2012 versus 2011.
Depreciation, wage and benefit inflation, higher fuel prices and volume-related trucking services purchased by our logistics subsidiaries, contributed to higher expenses  during   the  year.  Efficiency
 gains,

2013 Operating Expenses

volume related fuel savings (2% fewer gallons of fuel consumed) and $38 million of weather related expenses in 2011,
which favorably affects the comparison, partially offset the cost increase.

Compensation and Benefits

– Compensation and
benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, other postretirement benefits, and incentive costs. General wages and benefits inflation, higher work force levels and increased pension and other postretirement
benefits drove the increases in 2013 versus 2012. The impact of ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset these increases.

Expenses in 2012 were essentially flat versus 2011 as operational improvements and cost reductions offset general wage and benefit inflation and
higher pension and other postretirement benefits. In addition, weather related costs increased these expenses in 2011.

Fuel

– Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. Lower locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $3.15 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2013, compared to $3.22 in
2012, decreased expenses by $75 million. Volume, as measured by gross ton-miles, decreased 1% while the fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles, increased 2% compared to 2012. Declines in heavier, more
fuel-efficient coal shipments drove the variances in gross-ton-miles and the fuel consumption rate.

Higher locomotive diesel fuel
prices, which averaged $3.22 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2012, compared to $3.12 in 2011, increased expenses by $105 million. Volume, as measured by gross ton-miles, decreased 2% in 2012 versus 2011, driving expense
down. The fuel consumption rate was flat year-over-year.

Purchased Services and Materials –

Expense for purchased services
and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to
maintain the Railroad’s lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers;
leased automobile maintenance expenses; and tools and



supplies. Expenses for purchased services increased 10% compared to 2012 due to logistics management fees, an increase in locomotive overhauls and repairs on jointly owned property.

Expenses for contract services increased $103 million in 2012 versus 2011, primarily due to increased demand for transportation services purchased
by our logistics subsidiaries for their customers and additional costs for repair and maintenance of locomotives and freight cars.

Depreciation

– The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material.
Depreciation was up 1% compared to 2012. Recent depreciation studies allowed us to use longer estimated service lives for certain equipment, which partially offset the impact of a higher depreciable asset base resulting from larger capital spending
in recent years.

A higher depreciable asset base, reflecting ongoing capital spending, increased depreciation expense in 2012 compared
to 2011.

Equipment and Other Rents –

Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad
pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expenses. Additional container costs resulting from the logistics management arrangement, and increased
automotive shipments, partially offset by lower cycle times drove a $51 million increase in our short-term freight car rental expense versus 2012. Conversely, lower locomotive and freight car lease expenses partially offset the higher freight car
rental expense.

Increased automotive and intermodal shipments, partially offset by improved car-cycle times, drove an increase in our
short-term freight car rental expense in 2012 compared to 2011. Conversely, lower locomotive lease expense partially offset the higher freight car rental expense.

Other –

Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal injury, environmental, employee travel, telephone and cellular, computer
software, bad debt, and other general expenses. Higher property taxes and costs associated with damaged freight and property increased other costs in 2013 compared to 2012. Continued improvement in our safety performance and lower estimated
liability for personal injury, which reduced our personal injury expense year-over-year, partially offset increases in other costs.

Other costs in 2012 were slightly higher than 2011 primarily due to higher property taxes. Despite continual improvement in our safety experience
and lower estimated annual costs, personal injury expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011, as the liability reduction resulting from historical claim experience was less than the reduction in 2011.

Other Income

– Other income increased in 2013 versus 2012 due to higher gains from real estate sales
and increased lease income, including the favorable impact from the $17 million settlement of a land lease contract. These increases were partially offset by interest received from a tax refund in 2012.

Other income decreased in 2012 versus 2011 due to lower gains from real estate sales and higher environmental costs associated with non-operating
properties, partially offset by interest received from a tax refund.

Interest Expense

– Interest expense decreased in 2013
versus 2012 due to a lower effective interest rate of 5.7% in 2013 versus 6.0% in 2012. The increase in the weighted-average debt level to $9.6 billion in 2013 from $9.1 billion in 2012 partially offset the impact of the lower effective interest
rate.

Interest expense decreased in 2012 versus 2011 reflecting a lower effective interest rate in 2012 of 6.0% versus 6.2% in 2011 as
the debt level did not materially change from 2011 to 2012.



Income Taxes

– Higher pre-tax income increased income taxes in 2013 compared to 2012. Our
effective tax rate for 2013 was relatively flat at 37.7% compared to 37.6% in 2012.

Income taxes were higher in 2012 compared to 2011,
primarily driven by higher pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate remained relatively flat at 37.6% in 2012 compared to 37.5% in 2011.

OTHER
OPERATING/PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS

We report a number of key performance measures weekly to the Association of American
Railroads (AAR). We provide this data on our website at www.up.com/investors/reports/index.shtml.

Operating/Performance Statistics

Railroad performance measures are included in the table below:

[a]

As of January 1, 2014, we significantly changed the methodology for compiling our customer satisfaction information and, as a result, we will not
include this index in future reports as no meaningful comparison is available.

Note: Average rail car
inventory is no longer being reported as a key railroad performance measure because of recently identified inaccuracies in the AAR’s calculation for the rail industry, which prevents comparisons to prior reporting periods. The impact of changes
in rail car inventory will be described, as necessary, in connection with our discussion of train speed and/or terminal dwell metrics.

Average Train Speed

– Average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals. Average train speed, as reported to the Association of American
Railroads (AAR), decreased 2% in 2013 versus 2012. The decline was driven by severe weather conditions and shifts of traffic to sections of our network with higher utilization.

Average train speed increased 4% in 2012 versus 2011. Efficient operations and relatively mild weather conditions during the year compared
favorably to 2011, during which severe winter weather, flooding, and extreme heat and drought affected various parts of our network. We continued operating a fluid and efficient network while handling essentially the same volume and adjusting
operations to accommodate increased capital project work on our network compared to 2011.

Average Terminal Dwell Time

–
Average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals. Lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service. Average terminal dwell time increased 3% primarily due to continuing growth of
manifest traffic which requires more time in terminals for switching cars and building trains. Average terminal dwell time remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011, despite a shift in traffic mix to more manifest shipments, which require more
switching at terminals.

Gross and Revenue Ton-Miles

– Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded
and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles. Gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles declined 1% in 2013 compared to 2012 and carloads
remained relatively flat driven by declines in coal and agricultural products offset by growth in chemical, autos and industrial products. Gross ton-miles declined 2% in 2012 compared to 2011, while revenue ton-miles decreased 4% and carloads
remained relatively flat. Changes in commodity mix drove the year-over-year variances between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles and carloads.



Operating Ratio

– Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of
operating revenue. Our operating ratio improved 1.7 points to a new record low of 66.1% in 2013 versus 2012. Core pricing and productivity gains more than offset the impact of inflation. Our operating ratio improved 2.9 points to a record low of
67.8% in 2012 versus 2011. Core pricing gains, improved fuel recovery provisions, efficient operations and cost reductions more than offset the impact of inflationary pressures

Employees

– Employee levels increased 1% in 2013 versus 2012. Shifts in our traffic mix, which requires more resources, largely
concentrated in the Southern region, work related to higher capital investment in positive train control and more individuals in the training pipeline contributed to the higher employee levels. Employee levels increased 2% in 2012 versus 2011. Work
related to the increase in capital investment, including positive train control, accounted for over half of the increase. Additionally, the shift in our traffic mix required more resources in the Southern region to support the growth in
shale-related shipments.

Customer Satisfaction Index

– Our customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how
satisfied they are with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes. A higher score indicates higher customer satisfaction. As of January 1, 2014, we significantly changed the methodology for compiling our customer
satisfaction information and, as a result, we will not include this index in future reports as no meaningful comparison is available.

Return on Invested Capital as Adjusted (ROIC)

ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K, and may
not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance
criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is
Return on Average Common Shareholders’ Equity. The tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to ROIC. Our 2013 ROIC improved 0.7 points compared to 2012, primarily as a result of higher
earnings.



Debt to Capital / Adjusted Debt to Capital

Adjusted debt to capital is a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation
S-K, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure, including off-balance sheet lease
obligations, which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities. Operating leases were discounted using 5.7% and 6.0% at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The
discount rate reflects our effective interest rate. We monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance cost-effective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital. Adjusted
debt to capital should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, debt to capital. The tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital. Our December 31, 2013 debt to capital ratios
decreased as a result of a $1.3 billion increase in equity from December 31, 2012, driven by higher earnings.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2013, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, our receivables securitization
facility, and our revolving credit facility, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. We had $1.8 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility, with no borrowings
outstanding as of December 31, 2013. We did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2013. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the $600 million capacity receivables securitization facility was $0 as
of December 31, 2013. Amounts outstanding under this facility are included in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as debt due after one year. Our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if
our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market
conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is
also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization,
(ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of
the credit markets. The Company’s $1.8 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also serves as an emergency source of liquidity. The Company currently does not intend to make any
borrowings under this facility.

At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had a modest working capital surplus. This reflects a strong
cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment. In addition, we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy
our current liabilities.



Operating Activities

Higher net income in 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2012. In addition, we made payments in 2012 for past wages as a result of national labor negotiations, which reduced cash
provided by operating activities in 2012. Lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation (as discussed below) partially offset some of the increases.

Higher net income in 2012 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2011, partially offset by lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation and payments for past wages based on national labor
negotiations settled in 2012.

Federal tax law provided for 100% bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011, and 50%
bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012 and 2013. As a result, the Company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011, 2012 and 2013 income tax expense. This deferral decreased 2011, 2012 and 2013 income tax payments, thereby
contributing to the positive operating cash flow. In future years, however, income tax payments will increase as we pay these previously deferred income taxes.

Investing Activities

Lower capital investments in locomotives and freight cars drove the
decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to 2012.

Higher capital investments in 2012 drove the increase in cash used in
investing activities compared to 2011. Included in capital investments in 2012 was $75 million for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under long-term operating and capital leases during the first quarter of 2012, which we exercised due to favorable
economic terms and market conditions.

The following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011:

[a]

Other includes bridges and tunnels, signals, other road assets, and road work equipment.



Capital Plan

– In 2014, we expect our total capital investments to be approximately $3.9 billion, which
may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments. While the number of our assets replaced will fluctuate as part of our replacement strategy, for 2014 we
expect to use over 60% of our capital investments to replace and improve existing capital assets. Among our major investment categories are replacing and improving track infrastructure and upgrading our locomotive, freight car and container fleets,
including the acquisition of 200 locomotives. Additionally, we will continue increasing our network and terminal capacity, especially in the Southern region, and balancing terminal capacity with more mainline capacity. Construction of a major rail
facility at Santa Teresa, New Mexico, will be completed in 2014 and will include a run-through and fueling facility as well as an intermodal ramp. We also plan to make significant investments in technology improvements, including approximately $450
million for PTC.

We expect to fund our 2014 cash capital investments by using some or all of the following: cash generated from
operations, proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, and cash on hand. Our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long-term strategic plan, which we
expect will enhance the long-term value of the Corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to (i) replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations, (ii) increase network
efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track, and (iii) make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth.

Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities increased in 2013 versus 2012, driven
by a $744 million increase for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program and higher dividend payments in 2013 of $1.3 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2012. We increased our debt levels in 2013, which partially offset the
increase in cash used in financing activities.

Cash used in financing activities increased in 2012 versus 2011. Dividend payments in
2012 increased by $309 million, reflecting our higher dividend rate, and common stock repurchases increased by $56 million. Our debt levels did not materially change from 2011 after a decline in debt levels from 2010. Therefore, less cash was used
in 2012 for debt activity than in 2011.

Dividends

– On February 6, 2014, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.91
per share, payable on April 1, 2014, to shareholders of record on February 28, 2014. We expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations and cash on hand at December 31, 2013.

Credit Facilities

– On December 31, 2013, we had $1.8 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility (the
facility), which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper. We did not draw on the facility during 2013. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates
available to comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt. The facility matures
in 2015 under a four year term and requires the Corporation to maintain a debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing. At December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012 (and at all times during the year), we were in
compliance with this covenant.

The definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio includes,
among other things, certain credit arrangements, capital leases, guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under Title IV of ERISA. At December 31, 2013, the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to $42.4 billion of
debt (as defined in the facility), and we had $9.9 billion of debt (as defined in the facility) outstanding at that date. Under our current capital plans, we expect to continue to satisfy the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio; however, many factors
beyond our reasonable control



could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future. The facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing),
or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. The facility also includes a $75 million cross-default provision and a change-of-control provision.

During 2013, we did not issue or repay any commercial paper, and at December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper
balances, and, unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program, our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility.

As of December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, we have reclassified as long-term debt $0 and $100 million, respectively, of debt due
within one year that we intend to refinance. This reclassification reflects our ability and intent to refinance any short-term borrowings and certain current maturities of long-term debt on a long-term basis.

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges

For
each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 11.8, 10.4, and 8.4, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent income from
continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental
charges. (See Exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.)

Common Shareholders’ Equity

Dividend Restrictions

– Our revolving credit facility includes a debt-to-net worth covenant (discussed in the Credit
Facilities section above) that, under certain circumstances, restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained earnings available for dividends was $16.3 billion and $15.1 billion at December 31, 2013, and
2012, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program

Effective April 1, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 40 million shares of our common stock by March 31, 2014, replacing our previous repurchase program. As of
December 31, 2013, we repurchased a total of $9.3 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs. The table below represents shares repurchased under this repurchase program.

On November 21, 2013, our Board of Directors approved the early renewal of the share repurchase program,
authorizing the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of our common stock by December 31, 2017. The new authorization was effective January 1, 2014, and replaces the previous authorization, which expired on December 31, 2013,
three months earlier than its original expiration date.

Management’s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts
guide the timing and volume of all repurchases. We expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand.
Repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions and fees.

Shelf Registration
Statement and Significant New Borrowings

– We filed an automatic shelf registration statement that became effective on February 8, 2013. The Board of Directors authorized the



issuance of up to $4 billion of debt securities, replacing the $1.4 billion of authority remaining under our shelf registration filed in February 2010. SEC rules require UPC, a large accelerated
filer, to file a new shelf registration statement every three years. Under the current shelf registration, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or
preferred stock in one or more offerings. We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf
registration, and, therefore, we may issue additional debt securities at any time.

During 2013, we issued the following unsecured,
fixed-rate debt securities under our current shelf registration:

Date

Description of Securities

March 15, 2013

$325 million of 2.75% Notes due April 15, 2023

$325 million of 4.25% Notes due April 15, 2043

October 25, 2013

$500 million of 4.75% Notes due December 15, 2043

We used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common
stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions. At December 31, 2013, we had remaining authority to issue up to $2.85 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration.

In May 2012, we borrowed $100 million under a 4-year-term bank loan (the loan). The loan has a floating rate based on London Interbank
Offered Rates, plus a spread, and is prepayable in whole or in part without a premium prior to maturity. The agreement documenting the loan has provisions similar to our revolving credit facility, including identical debt-to-net-worth covenant and
change of control provisions and similar customary default provisions. The agreement does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers, or any other provision that would require us to post collateral.

Subsequent Event

– In 2014, we issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our current shelf registration:

Date

Description of Securities

January 10, 2014

$300 million of 2.25% Notes due February 15, 2019

$400 million of 3.75% Notes due March 15, 2024

$300 million of 4.85% Notes due June 15, 2044

Proceeds from this offering are for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock pursuant
to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions. As of February 7, 2014, we had remaining authority from our Board of Directors to issue up to $1.85 billion of debt securities under our shelf
registration.

Debt Exchange

– On August 21, 2013, we exchanged $1,170 million of various outstanding notes and
debentures due between 2016 and 2040 (Existing Notes) for $439 million of 3.646% notes (New 2024 Notes) due February 15, 2024 and $700 million of 4.821% notes (New 2044 Notes) due February 1, 2044, plus cash consideration of approximately
$280 million in addition to $8 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes. In accordance with ASC 470-50-40, Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments-Derecognition, this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange, as the
exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different. The cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt, and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the Existing Notes is
being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the New 2024 Notes and the New 2044 Notes. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange. Costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than
the debt holders totaled approximately $9 million and were included in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2013.



The following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged:

Debt Redemptions –

On May 14, 2013, we redeemed all $40 million of our outstanding 5.65% Port of
Corpus Christi Authority Revenue Refunding Bonds due December 1, 2022. The redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $1 million in the second quarter of 2013.

On November 30, 2012, we redeemed all $450 million of our outstanding 5.45% notes due January 31, 2013. The redemption resulted in an
early extinguishment charge of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.

On April 28, 2012, we redeemed all $100 million of our
outstanding 5.70% Tooele County, Utah Hazardous Waste Treatment Revenue Bonds due November 1, 2026. The redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $2 million in the second quarter of 2012.

On December 19, 2011, we redeemed the remaining $175 million of our 6.5% notes due April 15, 2012, and all $300 million of our
outstanding 6.125% notes due January 15, 2012. The redemptions resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Receivables Securitization Facility –

The Railroad maintains a $600 million, 364-day receivables securitization facility under which it sells most of its eligible third-party receivables to Union
Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer, without recourse an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors. The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other
assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI.

The
amount outstanding under the facility was $0 and $100 million at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The facility was supported by $1.1 billion of accounts receivable as collateral at both December 31, 2013, and
December 31, 2012, which, as a retained interest, is included in accounts receivable, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The outstanding amount the Railroad is allowed to maintain under the facility, with a maximum of $600 million, may fluctuate based on the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by business
volumes and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios. If default or dilution ratios increase one percent, the allowable outstanding amount under the facility would not materially change.

The costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest, which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates,
program fees paid to banks, commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability. The costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were $5 million, $3 million and $4 million for 2013,
2012, and 2011, respectively.



In July 2013, the $600 million receivables securitization facility was renewed for an additional
364-day period at comparable terms and conditions.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

As described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and
commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off-balance sheet and
structured finance arrangements, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report), there is no known trend, demand,
commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and
commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.

The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2013:

[a]

Excludes capital lease obligations of $1,702 million and unamortized discount of $(604) million. Includes an interest component of $6,025 million.

[b]

Includes leases for locomotives, freight cars, other equipment, and real estate.

[c]

Represents total obligations, including interest component of $498 million.

[d]

Purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for fuel purchases, locomotives, ties, ballast, and rail; and
agreements to purchase other goods and services. For amounts where we cannot reasonably estimate the year of settlement, they are reflected in the Other column.

[e]

Includes estimated other post retirement, medical, and life insurance payments, payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years.

[f]

Future cash flows for income tax contingencies reflect the recorded liabilities and assets for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties,
as of December 31, 2013. For amounts where the year of settlement is uncertain, they are reflected in the Other column.

[a]

None of the credit facility was used as of December 31, 2013.

[b]

None of the receivables securitization facility was utilized at December 31, 2013. The full program matures in July 2014.

[c]

Includes guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations.

[d]

None of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of December 31, 2013.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Guarantees

– At December 31, 2013, and 2012, we were contingently liable for $299 million and $307 million in guarantees. We have recorded a liability of $1 million and $2 million for the fair
value of these obligations as of December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment
financings, and affiliated operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

OTHER MATTERS

Labor Agreements –

Approximately 86% of our 46,445 full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. In 2012, we
concluded the most recent round of negotiations, which began in 2010, with the ratification of new agreements by several unions. All of the unions executed similar multi-year agreements that provide for higher employee cost sharing of employee
health and welfare benefits and higher wages. The current agreements will remain in effect until renegotiated under provisions of the Railway Labor Act. The next round of negotiations will begin in early 2015.

Inflation

– Long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capital-intensive companies. As a result, assuming that we
replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices. We are
not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the
hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception, as well as our risk-management
objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to
earnings. We may use swaps, collars, futures, and/or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices; however, the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable
price movements.

Market and Credit Risk

– We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting
instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. We manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic
settlements. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we were not required to provide collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities.

Determination of Fair Value

– We determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of
expected future cash flows.

Sensitivity Analyses

– The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that
hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.

At December 31, 2013, we had variable-rate debt representing approximately 2.2% of our total debt. If variable interest rates average one
percentage point higher in 2014 than our December 31, 2013 variable rate, which was approximately 0.9%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $2 million. This amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical
interest rate on the balances of our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2013.

Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the
potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2013, and amounts to an increase of approximately $1 billion to the fair value of our debt at December 31,
2013. We estimated the fair values of our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates.



Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges

– We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as
debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings. We employ derivatives, primarily swaps, as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our
debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed-rate debt securities.

Swaps allow us to convert
debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates. We account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short-cut method as allowed by the
Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC; therefore, we do not record any ineffectiveness within our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no interest rate fair
value hedges outstanding.

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges

– We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in
accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings. At both December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had reductions of $1 million recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straight-line
basis through September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding.

Accounting Pronouncements

– On February 5, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-02,

Reporting of Amounts
Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

(ASU 2013-02), which adds additional disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. We adopted this ASU during the three months ended
March 31, 2013.

Asserted and Unasserted Claims

– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our
subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity; however, to the extent possible, where asserted and unasserted claims are
considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated, we have recorded a liability. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.

Indemnities

– Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from
a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an
adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity
provisions.

Climate Change

– Although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial
performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report), we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact. However, we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our
operations on the environment, including investments in new technologies, using training programs to reduce fuel consumption, and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting policies affect significant areas
of our financial statements and involve judgment



and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material.

Personal Injury

– The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on
estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related
accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.

Our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Approximately
92% of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 8% is related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2013. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably
possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $294 million to $322 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other. Estimates can vary
over time due to evolving trends in litigation.

Our personal injury liability activity was as follows:

Our personal injury claims activity was as follows:

Asbestos

– We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other
parties allege exposure to asbestos. We assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestos-related claims. This liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs. The liability
for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:

•

The ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages adjusted for inflation.

•

The number of claims filed against us will decline each year.

•

The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages.

•

The percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages.

Our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments.
Approximately 18% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 82% related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2013. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos-related claims, it is
reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $131 million to $141 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other.



Our asbestos-related liability activity was as follows:

Our asbestos-related claims activity was as follows:

In conjunction with the liability update performed in 2013, we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries. We
have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2013, and 2012. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such
as the number of new claims filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues, could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates also may vary in the future if
strategies, activities, and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change; federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants; and there are material changes with
respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants.

Environmental Costs

– We are subject to federal, state, and
local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified 268 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 33 sites that are the
subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 17 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate
environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.

When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in our business, we perform, with assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on the property. We
expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash
payments is not fixed or readily determinable. At December 31, 2013, and 2012, none of our environmental liability was discounted, while less than 1% of our environmental liability was discounted at 2.0% at December 31, 2011.

Our environmental liability activity was as follows:

[a]

Payments include $25 million to resolve the Omaha Lead Site liability.



Our environmental site activity was as follows:

The environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing
monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and
regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination
by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing
environmental remediation. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

Property and Depreciation –

Our railroad operations are highly capital intensive, and our large base of homogeneous, network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis. Each year we develop a capital
program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers. Assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if
they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria. Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density
traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, yard and switching tracks, and electronic yards) for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track. We use the group method of depreciation in
which all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes, and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates. The group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not
as singular items. We currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes, and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology, asset strategies, or other factors.

We determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies. We perform depreciation studies at
least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets (i.e., rail and other track material, ties, and ballast) and other road property. Our depreciation studies take into account the following factors:

•

Statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes;

•

Evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets;

•

Evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices; and

•

Expected salvage to be received upon retirement.

For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track. It has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are
closely correlated to usage (i.e., the amount of weight carried over the rail). The service lives also vary based on rail weight, rail condition (e.g., new or secondhand), and rail type (e.g., straight or curve). Our depreciation studies for rail in
high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives. For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the
rail (i.e., the weight of loaded and empty freight cars, locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile. Rail in high-density traffic
corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material. Based on the number of gross ton-miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2013, the estimated service lives of the
majority of this rail ranged from approximately 15 years to approximately 30 years. For all other depreciable assets, we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives



of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies. Changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.

Estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use, technology, asset
strategies, and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets. We are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets. Actual use and
retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates, which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods.

Changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our Consolidated
Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $59 million. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased
by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $63 million. Our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes but did not significantly affect our annual depreciation
expense.

Under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the
ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using (i) inflation indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and
(ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. The indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. Because of
the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service
lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. In addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the
amount indicated by our depreciation studies. Any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets.

For retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the
retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) is unusual, (ii) is material in amount, and (iii) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. During the last three fiscal
years, no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties. A gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations.

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law; the effects of future tax legislation
are not anticipated. Future tax legislation, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. For example, a 1% increase in future income tax rates would
increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $370 million.

When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred
tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized,
based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset. In 2013 and 2012, there were no valuation allowances.

We recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as
the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition
and measurement standards.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

– We use an actuarial analysis to measure the
liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits (OPEB) to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses, we must make



several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets. For OPEB, the critical
assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate.

We evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected
assumptions are based on the following factors:

•

Discount rate is based on a Mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds (rated AA by a recognized rating agency) for which the timing and amount of
cash flows matches our plans’ expected benefit payments.

•

Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market
conditions.

•

Health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions.

The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) for 2013 and the estimated impact on
2013 net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) relative to a change in those assumptions:

The following table presents the net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) for the years ended December 31:

Our net periodic pension cost is expected to decrease to approximately $65 million in 2014 from $110 million in
2013. The decrease is driven mainly by an increase in the discount rate to 4.72%, Our net periodic OPEB expense is expected to increase to approximately $15 million in 2014 from $14 million in 2013. The increase in our net periodic OPEB cost is
primarily driven by a decrease in the amortization of prior service credits from accumulated other comprehensive income.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Union Pacific Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule

financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Corporation”, “Company”, “UPC”, “we”, “us”, and “our”
mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which will be separately referred to herein as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.

1. Nature of Operations

Operations and Segmentation

– We are a Class I railroad
operating in the U.S. Our network includes 31,838 route miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican gateways. We own 26,009 miles and operate on the
remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast,
the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders.

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although we provide and review revenue by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the
Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. The following table provides freight revenue by commodity group:

Although our revenues are principally derived from customers domiciled in the U.S., the ultimate points of
origination or destination for some products transported by us are outside the U.S. Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Included in the above table are revenues from our Mexico business which amounted to
$2.1 billion in 2013, $1.9 billion in 2012, and $1.8 billion in 2011.

Basis of Presentation

– The Consolidated Financial
Statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).

2. Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

– The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Union Pacific Corporation and all of its
subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies (20% to 50% owned) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. We currently have no less than majority-owned investments that require
consolidation under variable interest entity requirements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents –

Cash equivalents consist of investments with
original maturities of three months or less.

Accounts Receivable –

Accounts receivable includes receivables reduced by an
allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based upon historical losses, credit worthiness of customers, and current economic conditions. Receivables not expected to be collected in one year and the associated allowances are classified as
other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.



Investments –

Investments represent our investments in affiliated companies (20% to 50%
owned) that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and investments in companies (less than 20% owned) accounted for under the cost method of accounting.

Materials and Supplies –

Materials and supplies are carried at the lower of average cost or market.

Property and Depreciation –

Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in
high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, yard and switching tracks, and electronic yards), for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track. We use the group method of
depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes, and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates. The group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool
of resources, not as singular items. We determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies. Under the group method of depreciation, no gain or loss is recognized when depreciable property is retired
or replaced in the ordinary course of business.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets –

We review long-lived assets, including
identifiable intangibles, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less
than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows.

Revenue Recognition –

We recognize freight revenues as freight moves from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each
reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Other revenues, which include revenues earned by our subsidiaries, revenues from our commuter rail operations, and accessorial revenue, are recognized as service is performed or contractual
obligations are met. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues based on actual or projected future customer
shipments.

Translation of Foreign Currency –

Our portion of the assets and liabilities related to foreign investments are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Unrealized gains or losses are reflected within common
shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

Fair Value Measurements

– We use a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels include:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated
by market data.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

We have applied fair value measurements to our pension plan assets and short- and long-term debt.

Stock-Based Compensation –

We have several stock-based compensation plans under which employees and non-employee directors receive
stock options, nonvested retention shares, and nonvested stock units. We refer to the nonvested shares and stock units collectively as “retention awards”. We have elected to issue treasury shares to cover option exercises and stock unit
vestings, while new shares are issued when retention shares are granted.

We measure and recognize compensation expense for all
stock-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options. Compensation expense is based on the calculated fair value of the awards as measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the service period of the awards
(generally the vesting period). The fair value of retention awards is the closing stock price on the date of grant, while the fair value of stock options is determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.



Earnings Per Share –

Basic earnings per share are calculated on the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share include shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and stock-based awards where the conversion of such instruments would be dilutive.

Income Taxes –

We account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law; the effects of future tax legislation
are not anticipated. Future tax legislation, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized. In determining
whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of
estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset.

We recognize tax benefits that are more
likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax
benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits –

We incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions and postretirement health
benefits. In order to measure the expense associated with these benefits, we must make various assumptions including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses, compensation
increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and expected future health care costs. The assumptions used by us are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use an actuarial analysis to
measure the expense and liability associated with these benefits.

Personal Injury –

The cost of injuries to employees and
others on our property is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability. Our personal injury liability is not discounted to present
value. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.

Asbestos –

We estimate a liability for asserted and
unasserted asbestos-related claims based on an assessment of the number and value of those claims. We use a statistical analysis to assist us in properly measuring our potential liability. Our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted
to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.

Environmental –

When environmental issues have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we perform, with the
assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on such property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not
discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.

Use of Estimates –

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates and assumptions regarding certain assets, liabilities,
revenue, and expenses and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities. Actual future results may differ from such estimates.

Accounting Pronouncements

On February 5, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-02,

Reporting of Amounts
Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02),

which adds additional disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. We adopted this ASU during the three months ended
March 31, 2013.



4. Stock Options and Other Stock Plans

There are 7,140 restricted shares outstanding under the 1992 Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Union Pacific Corporation. We no
longer grant awards of restricted shares under this plan.

In April 2000, the shareholders approved the Union Pacific Corporation 2000
Directors Plan (Directors Plan) whereby 1,100,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance to our non-employee directors. Under the Directors Plan, each non-employee director, upon his or her initial election to the Board of Directors,
receives a grant of 2,000 retention shares or retention stock units. Prior to December 31, 2007, each non-employee director received annually an option to purchase at fair value a number of shares of our common stock, not to exceed 10,000
shares during any calendar year, determined by dividing 60,000 by 1/3 of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of such Board of Directors meeting, with the resulting quotient rounded up or down to the nearest 50 shares.
In September 2007, the Board of Directors eliminated the annual payment of options for 2008 and all future years. As of December 31, 2013, 18,000 restricted shares and 81,100 options were outstanding under the Directors Plan.

The Union Pacific Corporation 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (2001 Plan) was approved by the shareholders in April 2001. The 2001 Plan reserved
24,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance to eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in the form of non-qualified options, incentive stock options, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards. Non-employee
directors were not eligible for awards under the 2001 Plan. As of December 31, 2013, 6,804 options were outstanding under the 2001 Plan. We no longer grant any stock options or other stock or unit awards under this plan.

The Union Pacific Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (2004 Plan) was approved by shareholders in April 2004. The 2004 Plan reserved 42,000,000
shares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to awards made under previous plans that were outstanding on April 16, 2004, and became available for regrant pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Plan. Under the 2004 Plan,
non-qualified options, stock appreciation rights, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are not eligible for awards under the
2004 Plan. As of December 31, 2013, 3,633,693 options and 2,799,030 retention shares and stock units were outstanding under the 2004 Plan. We no longer grant any stock options or other stock or unit awards under this plan.

The Union Pacific Corporation 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (2013 Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2013. The 2013 Plan reserved 39,000,000
shares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to awards made under previous plans as of February 28, 2013, that are subsequently cancelled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued under previous plans. Under the 2013 Plan,
non-qualified options, incentive stock options, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are not eligible for awards under the 2013
Plan. As of December 31, 2013, only 1,064 retention shares and stock units were outstanding under the 2013 Plan.

Pursuant to the
above plans 39,787,448; 32,168,520; and 32,374,343 shares of our common stock were authorized and available for grant at December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

– We have several stock-based compensation plans under which employees and non-employee directors receive stock options, nonvested retention shares, and nonvested stock units.
We refer to the nonvested shares and stock units collectively as “retention awards”. We have elected to issue treasury shares to cover option exercises and stock unit vestings, while new shares are issued when retention shares are granted.
Information regarding stock-based compensation appears in the table below:



Stock Options

– We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The table below shows the annual weighted-average assumptions used for valuation purposes:

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; the dividend yield is
calculated as the ratio of dividends paid per share of common stock to the stock price on the date of grant; the expected life is based on historical and expected exercise behavior; and volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock
price over the expected life of the option.

A summary of stock option activity during 2013 is presented below:

Stock options are granted at the closing price on the date of grant, have ten-year contractual terms, and vest no
later than three years from the date of grant. None of the stock options outstanding at December 31, 2013 are subject to performance or market-based vesting conditions.

At December 31, 2013, there was $17 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1 year. Additional
information regarding stock option exercises appears in the table below:



Retention Awards –

The fair value of retention awards is based on the closing price of the
stock on the grant date. Dividends and dividend equivalents are paid to participants during the vesting periods.

Changes in our
retention awards during 2013 were as follows:

Retention awards are granted at no cost to the employee or non-employee director and vest over periods lasting up
to four years. At December 31, 2013, there was $71 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested retention awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

Performance Retention Awards

– In February 2013, our Board of Directors approved performance stock unit grants. Other than different
performance targets, the basic terms of these performance stock units are identical to those granted in February 2011 and February 2012, including using annual return on invested capital (ROIC) as the performance measure. We define ROIC as net
operating profit adjusted for interest expense (including interest on the present value of operating leases) and taxes on interest divided by average invested capital adjusted for the present value of operating leases.

Stock units awarded to selected employees under these grants are subject to continued employment for 37 months and the attainment of certain levels
of ROIC. We expense the fair value of the units that are probable of being earned based on our forecasted ROIC over the 3-year performance period. We measure the fair value of these performance stock units based upon the closing price of the
underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. Dividend equivalents are paid to participants only after the units are earned.

The assumptions used to calculate the present value of estimated future dividends related to the February 2013 grant were as follows:


Dividend per share per quarter

$

0.69

Risk-free interest rate at date of grant

0.4%

Changes in our performance retention awards during 2013 were as follows:

At December 31, 2013, there was $39 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested
performance retention awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years. This expense is subject to achievement of the ROIC levels established for the performance stock unit grants.



5. Retirement Plans

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Pension Plans

– We provide defined
benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest
years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements.

Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB)

– We provide
medical and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. These benefits are funded as medical claims and life insurance premiums are paid.

Funded
Status

We are required by GAAP to separately recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension and OPEB plans as an
asset or liability. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. Our non-qualified (supplemental) pension plan is unfunded by design. The PBO of the pension plans
is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future compensation increases. The PBO of the OPEB plan is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation, as the present value of the OPEB
liabilities is not affected by compensation increases. Plan assets are measured at fair value. We use a December 31 measurement date for plan assets and obligations for all our retirement plans.

Changes in our PBO and plan assets were as follows for the years ended December 31:

Amounts recognized in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 consist of:



Pre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) as of December 31,
2013 and 2012 consist of:

Pre-tax changes recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) expected to be amortized into net periodic cost

Underfunded Accumulated Benefit Obligation

– The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the present
value of benefits earned to date, assuming no future compensation growth. The underfunded accumulated benefit obligation represents the difference between the ABO and the fair value of plan assets. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the
non-qualified (supplemental) plan ABO was $302 million and $331 million, respectively. The following table discloses only the PBO, ABO, and fair value of plan assets for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligation is in excess of the fair
value of the plan assets as of December 31:

The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans was $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.



Assumptions

– The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit
obligations at December 31:

Expense

Both pension and OPEB expense are determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits (the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period)
and the interest cost on those liabilities, less the expected return on plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period.
This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return
assumptions. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized in net income immediately, but are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and, if necessary, amortized as pension or OPEB expense.

The components of our net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) were as follows for the years ended December 31:

Assumptions

– The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine expense were as follows for
the years ended December 31:

The discount rate was based on a yield curve of high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching our
plans’ expected benefit payments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into account current and expected market conditions. The actual return on pension plan assets, net of
fees, was approximately 17% in 2013, 13% in 2012, and 2% in 2011.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the expense
and liabilities reported for health care plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. The 2014 assumed health care cost trend rate for employees under 65 is 6.64%. It is



assumed the rate will decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 4.5% in 2028 and will remain at that level. A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have
the following effects on OPEB:

Cash Contributions

The following table details our cash contributions for the qualified pension plans and the benefit payments for the non-qualified (supplemental) pension and OPEB plans:

Our policy with respect to funding the qualified plans is to fund at least the minimum required by law and not more
than the maximum amount deductible for tax purposes. All contributions made to the qualified pension plans in 2013 were voluntary and were made with cash generated from operations.

The non-qualified pension and OPEB plans are not funded and are not subject to any minimum regulatory funding requirements. Benefit payments for
each year represent supplemental pension payments and claims paid for medical and life insurance. We anticipate our 2014 supplemental pension and OPEB payments will be made from cash generated from operations.

Benefit Payments

The following table details expected
benefit payments for the years 2014 through 2023:

Asset Allocation Strategy

Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and target allocation for 2014, are as follows:

The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve
our target average long-term rate of return of 7.5%. While we believe we can achieve a long-term average rate of return of 7.5%, we cannot be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations. Assets are strategically allocated among
equity, debt, and other investments in order to achieve a



diversification level that reduces fluctuations in investment returns. Asset allocation target ranges for equity, debt, and other portfolios are evaluated at least every three years with the
assistance of an independent consulting firm. Actual asset allocations are monitored monthly, and rebalancing actions are executed at least quarterly, if needed.

The pension plan investments are held in a Master Trust. The majority of pension plan assets are invested in equity securities because equity portfolios have historically provided higher returns than debt and other
asset classes over extended time horizons and are expected to do so in the future. Correspondingly, equity investments also entail greater risks than other investments. Equity risks are balanced by investing a significant portion of the plans’
assets in high quality debt securities. The average credit rating of the debt portfolio exceeded A+ as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The debt portfolio is also broadly diversified and invested primarily in U.S. Treasury, mortgage, and
corporate securities. The weighted-average maturity of the debt portfolio was 12 years at both December 31, 2013 and 2012.

The
investment of pension plan assets in securities issued by UPC is explicitly prohibited by the plan for both the equity and debt portfolios, other than through index fund holdings.

Fair Value Measurements

The pension plan assets are valued at fair value. The following is a
description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Temporary Cash Investments

– These investments consist of U.S. dollars and foreign currencies held in master trust accounts at The
Northern Trust Company. Foreign currencies held are reported in terms of U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates readily available in active markets. These temporary cash investments are classified as Level 1 investments.

Registered Investment Companies

– Registered Investment Companies are real estate investments, non-U.S. stock investments, and bond
investments registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The real estate investments and non-U.S. stock investments are traded actively on public exchanges. The share prices for these investments are published at the close of each
business day. Holdings of real estate investments and non-U.S. stock investments are classified as Level 1 investments. The bond investments are not traded publicly, but the underlying assets (stocks and bonds) held in these funds are traded on
active markets and the prices for these assets are readily observable. Holdings in bond investments are classified as Level 2 investments.

U.S. Government Securities

– Federal Government Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the U.S. Treasury or by government-sponsored enterprises.
These assets are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. Federal Government Securities are classified as Level 2 investments.

Corporate Bonds & Debentures

– Bonds and debentures consist of fixed income securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S.
corporations as well as state and local governments. These assets are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. Corporate, state, and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Level 2
investments.

Corporate Stock

– This investment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S.
corporations. Most common shares are traded actively on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily available. Common stock is classified as a Level 1 investment. Preferred shares included in this category are valued using a bid
evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Level 2 investment.

Venture Capital and Buyout Partnerships

– This investment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that invest
primarily in privately-held companies. Due to the private nature of the partnership investments, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are
based on the application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies, and other methods. Holdings of limited partnership interests are classified as Level
3 investments.



Real Estate Partnerships

– Most of the real estate investments are partnership interests
similar to those described in the Venture Capital and Buyout Partnerships category. This category also includes real estate investments held in less commonly used structures such as private real estate investment trusts and pooled separate accounts.
Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observable inputs and are primarily derived from property appraisals. Interests in private real estate partnerships, investment trusts and pooled separate accounts are classified
as Level 3 investments.

Common Trust and Other Funds

– Common trust funds are comprised of shares or units in commingled
funds that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these funds (U.S. stock funds, non-U.S. stock funds, commodity funds, and short term investment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds
are readily available. Holdings of common trust funds are classified as Level 2 investments.

This category also includes investments in
limited liability companies that invest in publicly-traded convertible securities, commodities, and other assets. The limited liability company investments are funds that invest in both long and short positions in convertible securities, stocks,
commodities, and fixed income securities. The underlying securities held by the funds are traded actively on exchanges and price quotes for these investments are readily available. Interests in the limited liability companies are classified as a
Level 2 investments.

Other Investments

– This category includes several miscellaneous assets such as commodity hedge fund
investments and derivative securities. These investments have valuations that are based on observable inputs and are classified as Level 2 investments.

As of December 31, 2013, the pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:

[a]

Other assets include accrued receivables and pending broker settlements.



As of December 31, 2012, the pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:

[a]

Other assets include accrued receivables and pending broker settlements.

For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no significant transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2, or 3.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 investments) during 2013:

The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value measurements
using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 investments) during 2012:



Other Retirement Programs

401(k)/Thrift Plan

– We provide a defined contribution plan (401(k)/thrift plan) to eligible non-union and union employees for whom we make matching contributions. We match 50 cents for each dollar
contributed by employees up to the first six percent of compensation contributed. Our plan contributions were $18 million in 2013, $15 million in 2012 and $14 million in 2011.

Railroad Retirement System

– All Railroad employees are covered by the Railroad Retirement System (the System). Contributions made to the System are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately
$670 million in 2013, $644 million in 2012, and $600 million in 2011.

Collective Bargaining Agreements

– Under collective
bargaining agreements, we participate in multi-employer benefit plans that provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible union employees. Premiums paid under these plans are expensed as incurred and amounted to
$57 million in 2013, $62 million in 2012, and $66 million in 2011.

6. Other Income

Other income included the following for the years ended December 31:

[a]

Rental income includes $17 million related to a land lease contract settlement.

7. Income Taxes

Components of income tax expense were as
follows for the years ended December 31:



For the years ended December 31, reconciliations between statutory and effective tax rates are as follows:

In February of 2011, Arizona enacted legislation that will decrease the state’s corporate tax rate. This
reduced our deferred tax expense by $14 million in the first quarter of 2011.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the
expected future tax consequences of events that are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The majority of our deferred tax assets relate to deductions that already have been claimed for financial reporting
purposes but not for tax purposes. The majority of our deferred tax liabilities relate to differences between the tax bases and financial reporting amounts of our land and depreciable property, due to accelerated tax depreciation (including bonus
depreciation), revaluation of assets in purchase accounting transactions, and differences in capitalization methods.

Deferred income tax
(liabilities)/assets were comprised of the following at December 31:

When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may
not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using
available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset. In 2013 and 2012, there were no valuation allowances.

Tax benefits are recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount
recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement
standards.



A reconciliation of changes in unrecognized tax benefits liabilities/(assets) from the beginning to
the end of the reporting period is as follows:

We recognize interest and penalties as part of income tax expense. Total accrued liabilities for interest and
penalties were $6 million at both December 31, 2013 and 2012. Total interest and penalties recognized as part of income tax expense (benefit) were $7 million for 2013, $(4) million for 2012, and $10 million for 2011.

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examinations have been completed and settled for all years prior to 2005, and the statute of limitations bars any
additional tax assessments. The IRS has completed their examinations and issued notices of deficiency for tax years 2005 through 2010. We disagree with many of their proposed adjustments, and we are at IRS Appeals for those years. Additionally,
several state tax authorities are examining our state income tax returns for years 2006 through 2010.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, we
reached an agreement in principle with the IRS to resolve all of the issues related to tax years 2005 through 2008, except for calculations of interest. We anticipate signing a closing agreement with the IRS within the next 12 months. Once
formalized, this agreement should have an immaterial effect on our income tax expense. Based on this agreement in principle, we made a payment of $80 million, consisting of $68 million of tax and $12 million of interest.

In 2012, UPC and the IRS signed a closing agreement resolving all tax matters for tax years 1999-2004. The settlement had an immaterial effect on
our income tax expense. In connection with the settlement, we received refunds of $8 million in 2013.

We do not expect our unrecognized
tax benefits to change significantly in the next 12 months. At December 31, 2013, we had a net unrecognized tax benefit liability of $59 million. Of that amount, $25 million is classified as a current liability in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.

The portion of our unrecognized tax benefits that relates to permanent changes in tax and interest would reduce our
effective tax rate, if recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which only the timing of the benefit is uncertain. Recognition of the tax benefits with uncertain timing would reduce our effective tax rate only
through a reduction of accrued interest and penalties. The unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate are as follows:

8. Earnings Per Share

The following table provides a reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31:

Common stock options totaling 0.2 million, 0.5 million, and 0.6 million for 2013, 2012, and 2011,
respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of these options exceeded the average market price of our common stock for the respective periods, and the effect of their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive.

9. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)

Reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) were as follows (net of tax):

[a]

The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) reclassification components are 1) prior service cost/(benefit) and 2) net actuarial loss which are both
included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 5 Retirement Plans for additional details.

10. Accounts
Receivable

Accounts receivable includes freight and other receivables reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance
is based upon historical losses, credit worthiness of customers, and current economic conditions. At December 31, 2013, and 2012, our accounts receivable were reduced by $1 million and $4 million, respectively. Receivables not expected to be
collected in one year and the associated allowances are classified as other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial



Position. At December 31, 2013, and 2012, receivables classified as other assets were reduced by allowances of $22 million and $33 million, respectively.

Receivables Securitization Facility –

The Railroad maintains a $600 million, 364-day receivables securitization facility under which it
sells most of its eligible third-party receivables to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer, without recourse an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors.
The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI.

The amount outstanding under the facility was $0 and $100 million at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The facility
was supported by $1.1 billion of accounts receivable as collateral at both December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, which, as a retained interest, is included in accounts receivable, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position.

The outstanding amount the Railroad is allowed to maintain under the facility, with a maximum of $600 million, may
fluctuate based on the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by business volumes and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios. If default or dilution ratios increase one
percent, the allowable outstanding amount under the facility would not materially change.

The costs of the receivables securitization
facility include interest, which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates, program fees paid to banks, commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability. The costs of the receivables securitization facility are
included in interest expense and were $5 million, $3 million and $4 million for 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

In July 2013, the
$600 million receivables securitization facility was renewed for an additional 364-day period at comparable terms and conditions.

11. Properties

The following tables list the major categories of property and equipment, as well as the weighted-average estimated useful life for
each category (in years):

Other roadway includes grading, bridges and tunnels, signals, buildings, and other road assets.



[a]

Other roadway includes grading, bridges and tunnels, signals, buildings, and other road assets.

Property and Depreciation –

Our railroad operations are highly capital intensive, and our large base of homogeneous, network-type
assets turns over on a continuous basis. Each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers.
Assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria. Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service
lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, yard and switching tracks, and electronic yards) for which lives are measured in millions of gross
tons per mile of track. We use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes, and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates. The group method
of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items. We currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes, and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology, asset
strategies, or other factors.

We determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies.
We perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets (i.e., rail and other track material, ties, and ballast) and other road property. Our depreciation studies take into account the following
factors:

•

Statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes;

•

Evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets;

•

Evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices; and

•

Expected salvage to be received upon retirement.

For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track. It has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are
closely correlated to usage (i.e., the amount of weight carried over the rail). The service lives also vary based on rail weight, rail condition (e.g., new or secondhand), and rail type (e.g., straight or curve). Our depreciation studies for rail in
high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives. For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the
rail (i.e., the weight of loaded and empty freight cars, locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile. For all other depreciable
assets, we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from



the analysis of our depreciation studies. Changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.

Under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of
business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using (i) inflation indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and (ii) the estimated
useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. The indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. Because of the number of estimates
inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and
the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. In addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our
depreciation studies. Any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets.

For retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) is
unusual, (ii) is material in amount, and (iii) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. A gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not
part of our railroad operations.

When we purchase an asset, we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended
use. However, many of our assets are self-constructed. A large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties, which is typically performed by our employees, and for track line expansion and
other capacity projects. Costs that are directly attributable to capital projects (including overhead costs) are capitalized. Direct costs that are capitalized as part of self-constructed assets include material, labor, and work equipment. Indirect
costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset.

General and administrative expenditures are expensed as
incurred. Normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred, while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized. These costs are allocated
using appropriate statistical bases. Total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $2.3 billion for 2013, $2.1 billion for 2012, and $2.2 billion for 2011.

Assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Amortization expense is
computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease.

Accounts Payable and Other Current Liabilities



13. Financial Instruments

Strategy and Risk

– We may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel
prices. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of
effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception, as well as
our risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
charged to earnings. We may use swaps, collars, futures, and/or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices; however, the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from
favorable interest rate and fuel price movements.

Market and Credit Risk

– We address market risk related to derivative
financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. We manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, by requiring high credit standards for
counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2013, and 2012, we were not required to provide collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities.

Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges

– We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed
and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings.
We employ derivatives, primarily swaps, as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing
outstanding callable fixed-rate debt securities.

Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge
the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates. We account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short-cut method; therefore, we do not record any ineffectiveness within our Consolidated Financial
Statements. As of December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had no interest rate fair value hedges outstanding.

Interest Rate Cash Flow
Hedges

– We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings. At both December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had reductions of $1 million recorded as an
accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straight-line basis through September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding.

Earnings Impact

– Our use of derivative financial instruments had no impact on pre-tax income for the years ended December 31,
2013, 2012, and 2011.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

– The fair value of our short- and long-term debt was estimated
using a market value price model, which utilizes applicable U.S. Treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt securities. All of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the Corporation’s long-term debt are
Level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source. At December 31, 2013, the fair value of total debt was $10.2 billion, approximately $0.6 billion more than the carrying value. At December 31, 2012, the fair value of total debt was
$11.1 billion, approximately $2.1 billion more than the carrying value. The fair value of the Corporation’s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. It does not impact the financial statements under current
accounting rules. At December 31, 2013, and 2012, approximately $163 million and $203 million, respectively, of debt securities contained call provisions that allow us to retire the debt instruments prior to final maturity, with the payment of
fixed call premiums, or in certain cases, at par. The fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.



14. Debt

Total debt as of December 31, 2013, and 2012, net of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, is summarized below:

Debt Maturities

– The following table presents aggregate debt maturities as of December 31, 2013,
excluding market value adjustments:

As of December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, we have reclassified as long-term debt $0 and $100
million, respectively, of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance. This reclassification reflects our ability and intent to refinance any short-term borrowings and certain current maturities of long-term debt on a long-term basis.

Equipment Encumbrances

– Equipment with a carrying value of approximately $2.9 billion at both December 31, 2013, and
2012 served as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment.

As a result of the merger of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MPRR) with and into UPRR on January 1, 1997, and pursuant to the underlying
indentures for the MPRR mortgage bonds, UPRR must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds. As of the merger date, the value of the MPRR assets that secured the
mortgage bonds was approximately $6.0 billion. In accordance with the terms of the indentures, this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds.

Credit Facilities

– On December 31, 2013, we had $1.8 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility (the
facility), which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper. We did not draw on the facility during 2013. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates
available to comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt. The facility matures
in 2015 under a four year term and requires the Corporation to maintain a debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing. At December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012 (and at all times during the year), we were in
compliance with this covenant.



The definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio includes,
among other things, certain credit arrangements, capital leases, guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under Title IV of ERISA. At December 31, 2013, the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to $42.4 billion of
debt (as defined in the facility), and we had $9.9 billion of debt (as defined in the facility) outstanding at that date. Under our current capital plans, we expect to continue to satisfy the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio; however, many factors
beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future. The facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision
that could require us to post collateral. The facility also includes a $75 million cross-default provision and a change-of-control provision.

During 2013, we did not issue or repay any commercial paper, and at December 31, 2013, and 2012, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper
balances, and, unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program, our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility.

Dividend Restrictions

– Our revolving credit facility includes a debt-to-net worth covenant (discussed in the Credit Facilities section
above) that, under certain circumstances, restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained earnings available for dividends was $16.3 billion and $15.1 billion at December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings

– We filed an automatic shelf registration statement that
became effective on February 8, 2013. The Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to $4 billion of debt securities, replacing the $1.4 billion of authority remaining under our shelf registration filed in February 2010. SEC rules
require UPC, a large accelerated filer, to file a new shelf registration statement every three years. Under the current shelf registration, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or
warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt
securities under our shelf registration, and, therefore, we may issue additional debt securities at any time.

During 2013, we issued the following
unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our current shelf registration:

Date

Description of Securities

March 15, 2013

$325 million of 2.75% Notes due April 15, 2023

$325 million of 4.25% Notes due April 15, 2043

October 25, 2013

$500 million of 4.75% Notes due December 15, 2043

We used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common
stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions. At December 31, 2013, we had remaining authority to issue up to $2.85 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration.

In May 2012, we borrowed $100 million under a 4-year-term bank loan (the loan). The loan has a floating rate based on London Interbank
Offered Rates, plus a spread, and is prepayable in whole or in part without a premium prior to maturity. The agreement documenting the loan has provisions similar to our revolving credit facility, including identical debt-to-net-worth covenant and
change of control provisions and similar customary default provisions. The agreement does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers, or any other provision that would require us to post collateral.



Subsequent Event

– In 2014, we issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities
under our current shelf registration:

Date

Description of Securities

January 10, 2014

$300 million of 2.25% Notes due February 15, 2019

$400 million of 3.75% Notes due March 15, 2024

$300 million of 4.85% Notes due June 15, 2044

Proceeds from this offering are for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock pursuant
to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions. As of February 7, 2014, we had remaining authority from our Board of Directors to issue up to $1.85 billion of debt securities under our shelf
registration.

Debt Exchange

– On August 21, 2013, we exchanged $1,170 million of various outstanding notes and
debentures due between 2016 and 2040 (Existing Notes) for $439 million of 3.646% notes (New 2024 Notes) due February 15, 2024 and $700 million of 4.821% notes (New 2044 Notes) due February 1, 2044, plus cash consideration of approximately
$280 million in addition to $8 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes. In accordance with ASC 470-50-40, Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments-Derecognition, this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange, as the
exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different. The cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt, and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the Existing Notes is
being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the New 2024 Notes and the New 2044 Notes. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange. Costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than
the debt holders totaled approximately $9 million and were included in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2013.

The
following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged:

Debt Redemptions –

On May 14, 2013, we redeemed all $40 million of our outstanding 5.65% Port of
Corpus Christi Authority Revenue Refunding Bonds due December 1, 2022. The redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $1 million in the second quarter of 2013.

On November 30, 2012, we redeemed all $450 million of our outstanding 5.45% notes due January 31, 2013. The redemption resulted in an
early extinguishment charge of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.

On April 28, 2012, we redeemed all $100 million of our
outstanding 5.70% Tooele County, Utah Hazardous Waste Treatment Revenue Bonds due November 1, 2026. The redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $2 million in the second quarter of 2012.



On December 19, 2011, we redeemed the remaining $175 million of our 6.5% notes due April 15,
2012, and all $300 million of our outstanding 6.125% notes due January 15, 2012. The redemptions resulted in an early extinguishment charge of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Receivables Securitization Facility –

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded $0 and $100 million, respectively, as secured
debt under our receivables securitization facility. (See further discussion of our receivables securitization facility in Note 10).

15. Variable
Interest Entities

We have entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain variable interest
entities (VIEs). These VIEs were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions (principally involving railroad equipment and facilities, including our headquarters building) and have no other activities, assets or liabilities outside of
the lease transactions. Within these lease arrangements, we have the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices. Depending on market conditions, fixed-price purchase options available in the leases could potentially provide benefits
to us; however, these benefits are not expected to be significant.

We maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations
within the lease arrangements, which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry. As such, we have no control over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets. We do not hold the power to direct
the activities of the VIEs and, therefore, do not control the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the VIEs. Additionally, we do not have the obligation to absorb losses of the VIEs or the right to receive
benefits of the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs.

We are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not
consolidate these VIEs because our actions and decisions do not have the most significant effect on the VIE’s performance and our fixed-price purchase price options are not considered to be potentially significant to the VIEs. The future
minimum lease payments associated with the VIE leases totaled $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2013.

16. Leases

We lease certain locomotives, freight cars, and other property. The Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2013 and
2012 included $2,486 million, net of $1,092 million of accumulated depreciation, and $2,467 million, net of $966 million of accumulated depreciation, respectively, for properties held under capital leases. A charge to income resulting from the
depreciation for assets held under capital leases is included within depreciation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms
in excess of one year as of December 31, 2013, were as follows:

Approximately 94% of capital lease payments relate to locomotives. Rent expense for operating leases with terms
exceeding one month was $618 million in 2013, $631 million in 2012, and $637 million in 2011. When cash rental payments are not made on a straight-line basis, we recognize variable rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Contingent rentals and sub-rentals are not significant.



17. Commitments and Contingencies

Asserted and Unasserted Claims

– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity; however, to the extent possible, where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated, we have recorded a liability. We
do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into
account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.

Personal Injury

– The cost of personal
injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability, including unasserted
claims. The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety
of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.

Our personal injury liability is not discounted to
present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Approximately 92% of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 8% is related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2013. Because of the
uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $294 million to $322 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as
no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.

Our personal
injury liability activity was as follows:

Asbestos

– We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other
parties allege exposure to asbestos. We assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestos-related claims. This liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs. The liability
for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:

•

The ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages adjusted for inflation.

•

The number of claims filed against us will decline each year.

•

The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages.

•

The percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages.

Our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments.
Approximately 18% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 82% related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2013. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos-related claims, it is
reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $131 million to $141 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other.



Our asbestos-related liability activity was as follows:

In conjunction with the liability update performed in 2013, we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries. We
have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2013, and 2012. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such
as the number of new claims filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues, could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates also may vary in the future if
strategies, activities, and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change; federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants; and there are material changes with
respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants.

Environmental Costs

– We are subject to federal, state, and
local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified 268 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 33 sites that are the
subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 17 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate
environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.

When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in our business, we perform, with assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on the property. We
expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash
payments is not fixed or readily determinable. At December 31, 2013, and 2012, none of our environmental liability was discounted, while less than 1% of our environmental liability was discounted at 2.0% at December 31, 2011.

Our environmental liability activity was as follows:

[a]

Payments include $25 million to resolve the Omaha Lead Site liability.

The environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any
anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for
remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and
quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. Current
obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.



Insurance

– The Company has a consolidated, wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the
captive), that provides insurance coverage for certain risks including FELA claims and property coverage which are subject to reinsurance. The captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreements that insure workers compensation, general
liability, auto liability and FELA risk. The captive cedes a portion of its FELA exposure through the treaty and assumes a proportionate share of the entire risk. The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s
premium costs in other expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The treaty agreements provide for certain protections against the risk of treaty participants’ non-performance, and we do not believe our exposure to treaty
participants’ non-performance is material at this time. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders for activity prior to the termination of the treaty
agreements. We record both liabilities and reinsurance receivables using an actuarial analysis based on historical experience in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Guarantees

– At December 31, 2013, and 2012, we were contingently liable for $299 million and $307 million in guarantees. We have
recorded a liability of $1 million and $2 million for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed
obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not
expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Indemnities

– Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the
nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the
total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.

Gain Contingency

– UPRR and Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines (SFPP, a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P.) currently are
engaged in a proceeding to resolve the fair market rent payable to UPRR under a 10-year agreement commencing on January 1, 2004, for pipeline easements on UPRR rights-of-way (

Union Pacific Railroad Company vs. Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines,
Inc., SFPP, L.P., Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. “D” Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., et al., Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, filed July 28, 2004

). In February 2007, a trial began to resolve this
issue, and, on September 28, 2011, the judge issued a tentative Statement of Decision, which concluded that SFPP owes back rent to UPRR for the years 2004 through 2011. On May 29, 2012, the court entered judgment, awarding UPRR back rent
and prejudgment interest. SFPP is appealing the final judgment. A favorable final judgment may materially affect our results of operations in the period of any monetary recoveries; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of
any recovery, including the outcome of SFPP’s appeal of this judgment or any subsequent proceeding, we consider this a gain contingency and do not reflect any amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31,
2013.



18. Share Repurchase Program

Effective April 1, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 40 million shares of our common stock by March 31, 2014, replacing our previous repurchase program. As of
December 31, 2013, we repurchased a total of $9.3 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs. The table below represents shares repurchased under this repurchase program.

On November 21, 2013, our Board of Directors approved the early renewal of the share repurchase program,
authorizing the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of common stock by December 31, 2017. The new authorization was effective January 1, 2014, and replaces the previous authorization, which expired on December 31, 2013, three
months earlier than its original expiration date.

Management’s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide
the timing and volume of all repurchases. We expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand.
Repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions and fees.

Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Vice President – Finance and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO
and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Additionally, the CEO and CFO determined that there
were no changes to the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.



MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). The Corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Corporation’s
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

The Corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992).

Based on our assessment,
management believes that, as of December 31, 2013, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on
the next page.

February 6, 2014



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Union Pacific Corporation:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Corporation and our report dated February 7, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
schedule.
