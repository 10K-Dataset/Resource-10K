UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION



PART I

Item 1.

Business

GENERAL

Union Pacific Corporation operates primarily as a rail transportation provider through
Union Pacific Railroad Company, its principal operating company, which is the largest railroad in North America, covering 23 states across the western two-thirds of the United States. Union Pacific Corporation was incorporated in Utah in 1969 and
maintains its principal executive offices at 1400 Douglas Street, Omaha, NE 68179. The telephone number at that address is (402) 544-5000. The common stock of Union Pacific Corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol
“UNP”.

For purposes of this report, unless the
context otherwise requires, all references herein to “UPC”, “Corporation”, “we”, “us”, and “our” shall mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company,
which will be separately referred to as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.

Our operating results include Southern Pacific Rail Corporation, which we acquired in October 1996. During 1997, the Railroad acquired an ownership interest in a consortium that was granted a 50-year concession to
operate the Pacific-North and Chihuahua Pacific lines in Mexico. The Railroad made an additional investment in the consortium in 1999 and currently holds a 26% ownership interest. In November 2003, we completed the sale of our entire trucking
interest through an underwritten initial public offering of all the common stock of Overnite Corporation, leaving the Railroad as our only operating segment and the principal source of our revenues.

OPERATIONS

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail
affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include our discontinued trucking operations, consisting of Overnite Transportation Company (OTC) and Motor Cargo Industries, Inc. (Motor Cargo). Our
trucking segment was reclassified as a discontinued operation in 2003. Additional information regarding our operations is presented within Selected Financial Data, Item 6; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations, Item 7; and the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8.



Continuing Operations

– UPRR is a Class I railroad that operates in the United States. We have approximately
33,000 route miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern United States gateways and providing several north/south corridors to key Mexican gateways. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain
coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast
ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders. Railroad commodity revenue totaled $11.7 billion in 2004 and is comprised of the following six commodity groups:

Agricultural

– The transportation of agricultural products, including whole grains (for animal and human consumption) and
commodities produced from these grains, food and beverage products, and sweeteners, provided 14% of the Railroad’s 2004 commodity revenue. With access to most major grain markets, the Railroad provides a critical link between the Midwest and
western producing areas and the primary Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Gulf ports, as well as Mexico. UPRR also serves significant domestic markets, including grain processors and feeders and ethanol producers in the Midwest, West, South, and Rocky
Mountain states. Unit trains of grain efficiently shuttle between producers and export terminals or domestic markets. Primary food commodities consist of a variety of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and beverages that are
moved to major U.S. population centers for consumption. Express Lane, our premium and perishables service that moves fruits and vegetables from the PNW and California to destinations in the East, continues to focus on drawing market share from the
trucking industry. Frozen meat and poultry are also transported to the West Coast ports for export, while beverages are imported into the U.S. from Mexico. Sweeteners are primarily short-haul sugar beet movements from the fields to the refineries,
both of which are located in Idaho.

Automotive

– UPRR is the
largest automotive carrier west of the Mississippi River, serving seven vehicle assembly plants and distributing imported vehicles from six West Coast ports and Houston. The Railroad serves 42 vehicle distribution centers that deliver vehicles to
all major western U.S. cities. These centers serve as rail car-to-truck haul away operations for major domestic and international automotive manufacturers. In addition to transporting finished vehicles, UPRR currently provides expedited handling of
automobile materials in both boxcars and containers to several assembly plants. Mexico continues to be an integral part of our automotive business. The Railroad carries automobile materials bound for assembly plants in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada
to and from Mexican interchanges and transports finished vehicles from manufacturing facilities in Mexico. In 2004, transportation of finished vehicles and automobile materials accounted for 11% of the Railroad’s total commodity revenue.

Chemicals

– The transportation of chemicals provided 15% of
UPRR’s 2004 commodity revenue. The Railroad’s franchise enables it to serve the large chemical producing areas along the Gulf Coast, as well as the Rocky Mountain region. More than two-thirds of the chemicals business consists of liquid
and dry chemicals, plastics, and liquid petroleum products. In addition to transporting plastics, customers also leverage UPRR’s industry leading storage-in-transit yards for intermediate storage of plastic resins. Soda ash shipments originate
in southwestern Wyoming and California and are consumed primarily in glass producing markets in the East, the West, and abroad. Fertilizer movements originate primarily in the Gulf Coast region, as well as the West and Canada, bound for major
agricultural end-users in the Midwest and the western U.S.

Energy

– Coal transportation accounted for 20% of UPRR’s 2004 commodity revenue. The Railroad’s geographic footprint positions it to transport coal destined for utilities and industrial facilities in 27 states, as well as to the Gulf and
rail/barge/ship facilities on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and the Great Lakes. UPRR serves mines located in the Southern Powder River Basin of Wyoming, in addition to Colorado, Utah, southern Wyoming, and southern Illinois. Southern Powder River
Basin coal represents the largest growth segment of the market, as utilities continue to favor its low cost and low-sulfur content. In addition, UPRR continues to penetrate markets in the East as electricity generation continues to grow in the face
of declining eastern coal production. High-BTU, low-sulfur coal from Colorado and Utah is also transported for export to Mexico.

Industrial Products

– The industrial products group includes a broad range of commodities, from bulk products like stone, cement, minerals, waste, and scrap
to higher-value shipments like lumber, paper, government, and consumer goods. Bulk commodities often move in unit train service from origin to a distribution facility in major metropolitan areas. Other commodities move in manifest trains and rely on
the Railroad’s extensive network to move between thousands of shippers and customers across North America. In 2004, the transportation of industrial products provided 21% of the Railroad’s total commodity revenue.



Intermodal

– UPRR’s intermodal business, which represents 19% of the Railroad’s 2004 commodity
revenues, is classified as international, domestic, or premium shipments. International business consists of international container traffic for steamship customers. It arrives at West Coast ports for destinations throughout the United States.
Domestic business includes domestic container and trailer traffic handled by intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and consolidators) and truckload carriers. Less-than-truckload and package carriers with time-sensitive business
requirements account for the majority of our premium service. Service performance and reliability are important in driving intermodal business growth.

Working Capital

– We currently have, and historically have had, a working capital deficit, which is not uncommon in our industry and does not indicate a lack
of liquidity or financial stability. We maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.

Competition

– We are subject to competition from other railroads, motor carriers, and barge operators. Our main rail competitor
is Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. Its rail subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company, operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other competing railroads and by motor carriers.
Motor carrier competition is particularly strong with respect to five of our six commodity groups (excluding energy) due to shorter delivery times offered by such carriers. Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and Gulf Coast
waterways, barge competition can be particularly pronounced, especially for grain and bulk commodities. Competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing, as well as place a greater emphasis on the quality and reliability of the
service provided. While we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or
reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Equipment Suppliers

– We are dependent on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives. Due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of this equipment and its production, there are high barriers of entry to potential new
suppliers. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives, we could experience a significant cost increase and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations.

Employees

– Approximately 87% of our more than 48,000 full-time
equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. Under the collective bargaining round that began on November 1, 1999, 11 of the 14 unions reached new labor agreements with the railroads. We are currently negotiating new agreements with
the remaining three unions. Existing agreements remain in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of
Presidential intervention) are exhausted. The current agreements provide for periodic wage increases until new agreements are reached.

On November 1, 2004, notices for the next round of negotiations were sent to all 14 unions by the National Railway Labor Conference on behalf of UPRR (and
other carriers in the conference). These legal notices state our desire to modify the current collective bargaining agreements. Contract negotiations with the various unions usually take place over an extended period of time and generally have not
resulted in work stoppages.

Discontinued Operations

– In November
2003, we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest, and as a result, the operations of OTC and Motor Cargo are included in discontinued operations (see note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8).

GOVERNMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Governmental Regulation

– Our operations are subject to a variety of federal,
state, and local regulations, generally applicable to all businesses (see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in Legal Proceedings, Item 3).



The operations of the Railroad are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation
Board (STB) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and other federal and state agencies. The operations of the Railroad are also subject to the regulations of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) of the DOT. The STB has
jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic; freight car compensation; transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of rail common carriers.

The DOT and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, along with
other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, movement of hazardous materials, movement and disposal of hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. Various state and local agencies have jurisdiction
over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.

On February 14, 2005, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ). The CID seeks
information concerning pricing activities for the transportation of coal carried by UPRR from the Southern Powder River Basin. During 2004, several coal shippers’ organizations questioned the appropriateness of our pricing practices for
Southern Powder River Basin coal transportation. The Railroad initiated a meeting with the DOJ in early December in order to explain those practices and the manner in which price information is distributed to customers. It is not uncommon for the
DOJ to issue CIDs to gather additional facts and information to facilitate its investigatory functions. Issuance of a CID does not indicate any conclusion with respect to the legality of our coal pricing activities. We are confident that the
DOJ’s investigation will confirm that our activities are lawful, and we intend to cooperate with the DOJ’s request for information.

Environmental Regulation

– In addition to the regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials, we are subject to extensive federal and state
environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment. The statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by various state environmental agencies. The laws
primarily affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1976,
regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating waste water discharges.

Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7.

Item 2.

Properties

Our primary real estate,
equipment, and other properties are owned or leased to support our rail operations. We operate facilities and equipment designated for both maintenance and repair, including locomotives, rail cars, and other equipment, and for monitoring such
maintenance and repair work. Other facilities include rail yards, intermodal ramps, and maintenance shops throughout the rail system. We spent approximately $1.9 billion in capital during 2004 for, among other things, building and maintaining track,
structures and infrastructure, upgrading and augmenting equipment, and implementing new technologies (see the capital expenditures table in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity
and Capital Resources – Financial Condition, Item 7).

Certain of our properties are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment (see discussion of environmental issues in Business – Governmental and Environmental Regulation, Item
1, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7).

Track

– Our rail operations utilize approximately 33,000 main line and branch line route miles in 23 states in the western
two-thirds of the United States. We own approximately 27,000 route miles, with the remainder of route miles operated under trackage rights or leases. Route miles operated and track miles installed and replaced as of, and for the year ending,
December 31, 2004 are as follows:



Equipment

– Our primary
rail equipment consisted of the following as of, and for the year ending, December 31, 2004:

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Environmental
Matters

As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003,
the United States Attorney for the Central District of California notified us that the office intended to pursue criminal charges against us for alleged violations of federal environmental laws, including the federal Clean Water Act, in connection
with releases of oil and oil contaminated water from our Taylor Yard in 2001 and 2003. In April 2004, we settled the State of California’s claims arising from these releases for $45,020.

As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003, the
California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) threatened civil prosecution against us in November 2003, after a series of protracted negotiations, relating to our failure to register as a hazardous waste transporter under California law
from April 2000 to August 2001. We contend that we are exempt from the registration requirements due to federal preemption. The DTSC has proposed civil penalties of $125,160 for the alleged violation. We continue to vigorously oppose this proposed
penalty.

As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for 2001, on January 30, 2002, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) issued to the Railroad a notice of a proposed penalty assessment in the amount of $195,700. The LDEQ proposed penalty relates to the derailment of one of
our trains carrying hazardous materials near Eunice, Louisiana on May 27, 2000. We met with the LDEQ regarding this matter to present documentation indicating that no penalty should be assessed. We have filed suit against the LDEQ in Louisiana State
District Court challenging the penalty.

As previously reported
in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the San Joaquin County District Attorney filed an action against us on February 3, 2003, alleging claims under the California Business and Professions Code section 17200
(unfair business practices), Fish and Game Code section 5650 and 5650.1, California Health and Safety Code section 25189(d) and Public Nuisance, California Civil Code



section 3480. The claims arise from a February 16, 2000 derailment in Stockton, California, in which a locomotive struck an object on the tracks, resulting
in the puncture of a fuel tank. The District Attorney alleged that diesel fuel from this spill entered waters of the State of California. The complaint also asserted claims under the above referenced statutes for any other diesel spill which may
have occurred in the State of California, between 2000 and 2003, in which diesel may have passed into waters of the State of California and seeks injunctive relief, as well as civil penalties of $25,000 for the alleged February 16, 2000 diesel spill
and total penalties of not less than $250,000 for all diesel spills which may have occurred since 2000. The District Attorney filed an amended complaint on April 10, 2003, which narrowed the claims to the incident of February 16, 2000. The amended
complaint seeks both injunctive relief and daily penalties for each day that fuel was in the affected waterway, which could exceed $100,000.

As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003, a criminal case relating to a series of alleged releases of calcium oxide (lime) was
filed against the Railroad by the District Attorneys of Merced, Madera, and Stanislaus Counties in California. The criminal case was dismissed in the last quarter of 2003 and was subsequently refiled as a civil action by several counties. The
refiled suit sought civil penalties against the Railroad in connection with the release of lime from an unidentified rail car between Chowchilla and Sacramento, California, on December 27, 2001, and another incident in which lime leaked from a rail
car between Chowchilla and Stockton, California on February 21, 2002. The suit contended that regulatory violations occurred by virtue of the Railroad’s alleged failure to timely report the release of a “hazardous material,” its
alleged disposal of hazardous waste, and the alleged release of material into the waters of the State of California. On September 20, 2004, the Court dismissed the suit with prejudice. The State appealed this decision and the appeal remains pending.

As previously reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended March 31, 2002, on April 26, 2002, we received written notice of a proposed $250,000 penalty from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency relating to a collision between trains from Conrail and the Railroad. The collision
occurred near Momence, Illinois, on March 23, 1999, when an eastbound Conrail train failed to stop at a signal and struck a UPRR train that was properly occupying a crossing. The collision resulted in a release of diesel fuel from the fuel tanks of
our locomotive, which was promptly reported and remediated. We received notice in January 2003 that the amount of the proposed penalty, including oversight costs, had been reduced to $127,000. We continue to vigorously oppose this proposed penalty.

As previously reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Attorney General’s office of Illinois filed an Agreed Order and Complaint and a Complaint for Injunctive and Other Relief on October 7, 2004, against The Alton & Southern Railway Company, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Railroad, as a result of a collision and derailment on September 21, 2004. The state seeks to enjoin The Alton & Southern from further violations, as well as impose a monetary penalty. The amount of the proposed
penalty is uncertain but could exceed $100,000.

In December
2004, we were advised by the District Attorney of Riverside County, California, that the County intends to file either a criminal or civil action against the Railroad as a result of the Railroad’s alleged unlawful disposal of hazardous waste.
This claim arises out of an April 2004 incident in which a construction crew allegedly discarded hazardous waste into a dumpster that was subsequently taken to a landfill in Cathedral City, California. The District Attorney intends to seek fines or
penalties in excess of $100,000.

We have received notices from
the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under certain federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the United States, including sites that are on the Superfund National
Priorities List or state superfund lists. Although specific claims have been made by the EPA and state regulators with respect to some of these sites, the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits by third parties cannot be predicted at this
time because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and/or the speculative nature of remediation costs.

Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies
and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7.

Other Matters

As previously reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, we were notified that a

qui
tam,

or private citizen, complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Central



District of California against, among other parties, the City of Long Beach, City of Long Beach Harbor Department, Port of Long Beach (the Port), Union
Pacific Corporation, Union Pacific Railroad Company, and Union Pacific Resources Company, also known as Union Pacific Resources Group Inc. (Resources), a former subsidiary of UPC. A private citizen filed the action because the federal government and
the State of California elected not to pursue the claims. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Federal Civil False Claims Act and the California False Claims Act by conspiring to use public funds to (1) shift environmental cleanup
liability to the Port when Resources sold its Terminal Island oil field property to the Port in 1994, and (2) effect the acquisition by the Port of the Terminal Island property in which the Port (or the State of California) allegedly already held
certain incidents of title. The complaint, which has not been served on us, seeks damages of $2.405 billion, unspecified costs for remediating groundwater contamination, and treble damages and civil penalties of $10,000 per day. We dispute the
factual and legal bases of the complaint. Also, we have notified Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko), as successor to Resources after its acquisition in 2000, that an indemnification agreement between Resources and the Corporation obligates
Anadarko to indemnify us for all damages, costs, and expenses related to the complaint.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8, and other information in this report, including Critical Accounting Policies, Risk Factors, and Cautionary Information set
forth at the end of this Item 7.

The Railroad, along with its
subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. The Consolidated Financial Statements in 2003 and 2002 also include discontinued trucking operations, consisting of OTC and Motor Cargo, which were subsidiaries of Overnite,
Inc., formerly an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of UPC. In 2003, we reclassified our trucking operations as discontinued operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2004 Highlights

·

Safety

– During a year when we added many new crew personnel and moved record volumes, the number of new claims for lost work day cases declined by 9%, and incidents
reportable to the FRA decreased by over 2%. The number of derailments for the year was flat compared to 2003, trespasser incidents declined 11%, while our grade crossing accidents were up slightly over 2003. As part of our continuing focus on public
safety, we worked to reduce grade-crossing incidents by closing numerous crossings, upgrading many others, training law-enforcement officers, and educating the public about the risks associated with crossings. In an effort to reduce derailments, we
increased track inspections, employed new technology to identify car defects before failure, and implemented operating practice improvements to accelerate skill development and promote situational awareness with our train crews and yard personnel.

·

Revenue Growth

– We increased operating revenues by 6% year-over-year to $12.2 billion, the highest level in our history, as vigorous economic growth led to
unprecedented demand for our services. We achieved record revenue levels in four of our major commodity groups: agricultural, automotive, industrial products, and intermodal. The higher revenue was attributable primarily to additional fuel
surcharges, better pricing yields, and increased carloads, and reflects our continued focus on our Yield Strategy. The key components of our Yield Strategy are providing service that meets customer needs at prices that reflect the value of our
services and achieving a mix of business that maximizes profitability.

·

Resources

– We made substantial progress during 2004 to increase our train crews and locomotive resources. Through aggressive hiring and training programs, we placed
into conductor service nearly 5,000 new trainmen, resulting in a 19% net increase in trainmen, and trained nearly 700 conductors to become engineers, a 3% net increase. In addition to hiring and training crews, we accelerated locomotive acquisitions
to improve velocity, with almost 400 new locomotives entering our system during 2004, an increase of 6% in our locomotive road fleet.

·

Free Cash Flow

– We generated free cash flow of $215 million in 2004. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities, less cash used in investing
activities, dividends paid, and non-cash capital lease financings plus non-cash acquisitions.



Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G. We believe
free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided
by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):

2004 Challenges

·

Energy Prices

– Energy prices were high throughout the year, increasing our operating expenses by $416 million over 2003. However, our fuel surcharges offset over 50% of
these higher fuel costs. Our fuel surcharge programs allow us to recover a portion of the increase in fuel expense from customers in the form of higher revenue.

·

Network Performance

– Due to the unprecedented demand for our services and our resource shortages, we experienced operational challenges throughout 2004. Our network
performance and operating efficiency were initially affected in the latter part of 2003 by a shortage of trainmen and engineers and fourth quarter record-level volumes. During 2004, we largely addressed our resource shortages by aggressive hiring
and training of train crews, along with long- and short-term locomotive and freight car acquisition and leasing programs. However, our record volumes consumed many of the resources we added, preventing us from improving operational efficiency and
creating congestion in several key corridors. In addition to adding resources, we also regulated business levels to reduce congestion. Our service issues, including increased hiring and training efforts, added approximately $300 million in operating
expenses during 2004.

2005 Outlook

·

Safety

–

In 2005, operating safety will continue to be our first priority. With our extensive hiring efforts, our approach to safety for our new employees
incorporates training, communication, and quality assurance. With respect to public safety, we will continue our efforts to upgrade and close crossings, improve visibility at crossings, install video cameras on locomotives, and educate the public on
crossing safety. We will also continue our focus on derailment prevention.

·

Revenue Growth

– Record revenue levels are expected to continue in 2005. We have established a target for year-over-year commodity revenue growth of five to seven
percent. We intend to manage total volume growth to one to two percent, and we are projecting yield increases in all of our major commodity groups. We expect the largest percentage increases in revenue from the energy, intermodal, and industrial
products groups, and we should see steady but more modest increases in revenue from automotive, chemical, and agricultural shipments.

·

Energy Prices

– We expect that fuel prices will remain volatile throughout the year. To help reduce the impact of fuel price volatility on earnings, we will continue to
increase the amount of traffic subject to a fuel surcharge.

·

Capital Plan

– In 2005, we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately $2 billion. These expenditures will be used to maintain track and
structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors, remove bottlenecks, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer



needs, build and improve facilities and terminals, and develop and implement new technologies. We expect to fund our 2005 capital expenditures through cash
generated from operations, additional debt financings, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2004. In addition to cash capital expenditures, we expect to acquire locomotives and certain
other equipment through short- and long-term operating leases. This focused capital plan is designed to assist in expanding capacity, improving network velocity, and facilitating revenue growth.

·

Transportation Plan

– In the latter part of 2004, we initiated a comprehensive redesign of our transportation plan. We expect to fully implement this new Unified Plan by
the middle of 2005. The new plan is intended to simplify our operations, improve network velocity, and better manage the volume of traffic flowing on our network in the face of continued strong demand. We are also using industrial engineering
techniques to increase throughput and improve terminal processing.

·

California Weather Impact

– In early January of 2005, a massive storm hit California and Nevada. Our rail system suffered significant damage, resulting in the temporary
shutdown of five of six routes in and out of Los Angeles. Two of those routes required extensive reconstruction. Embargos were instituted to restrict traffic to and from Southern California and the Las Vegas area until service could be restored,
while a number of trains were rerouted onto other serviceable tracks. We are still assessing the financial impact of the storm. Although we have insurance coverage and are subject to a $50 million deductible, we will not be able to finalize matters
with our insurance carriers for some time.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Income from Continuing
Operations

– Income from continuing operations declined in 2004 due to higher fuel prices, a $154 million after-tax asbestos charge, higher operational costs associated with a slower network, volume-related expenses, and wage and benefit
inflation. Revenue growth of 6% partially offset the higher expenses.

The decrease in income from continuing operations in 2003 was a result of higher fuel prices, inflation, network costs (including expenses associated with increased volumes), lower gains from real estate sales (2002 asset sales included
transactions with the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) for $141 million pre-tax and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) for $73 million pre-tax), and debt redemption expenses, which more than offset revenue gains, lower interest
expense, and productivity improvements. Productivity is measured by both gross ton-miles per inflation-adjusted expense dollar and gross ton-miles per employee.

Operating Revenues

– Operating revenue is comprised of commodity revenue and other revenues. Other revenues primarily include subsidiary revenue from
various companies that are wholly owned or majority owned by the Railroad, revenue from our commuter rail operations, and accessorial revenue earned due to customer detainment of Railroad owned or controlled equipment. We recognize commodity
revenues on a percentage-of-completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. Other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the
relative transit time in each reporting period.



Operating revenues increased $664 million (6%) to $12.2 billion in 2004, compared to an increase of $392
million (4%) in 2003. Commodity revenue increased $651 million (6%) in 2004 and $378 million (4%) in 2003. The increase in 2004 was driven by the industrial products, intermodal, and chemical commodity groups, while growth in 2003 was generated by
gains in the industrial products, agricultural, intermodal, and energy commodity groups.

Average revenue per car (ARC) improved 3% to $1,236 in 2004 compared to a 2% increase in 2003, while revenue carloads increased 2% and 1% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in both periods was driven by fuel
surcharges, price increases, and index-based contract escalators. We recognized $330 million and $112 million in commodity revenue from our fuel surcharge programs in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Other revenue increased $13 million (3%) in 2004 driven by increased
passenger and subsidiary revenue, partially offset by a decrease in accessorial revenues. In 2003, other revenue improved $14 million (3%) due to higher passenger, subsidiary, and accessorial revenues.

The following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in commodity
revenue, revenue carloads, and average revenue per car by commodity type:

Agricultural

–

The 2004 improvement was driven by increased demand for dry feed ingredients and the positive ARC impact of longer average length of haul shipments. Corn and feed grain shipments also posted revenue gains as demand for these shipments
to the Pacific Northwest improved. Revenue growth was also achieved through



additional shipments for Gulf export and wheat to Mexico. ARC grew due to the positive mix impact of longer average length of haul shipments, as well as
price increases and fuel surcharges.

Revenue growth in 2003
was driven by higher demand for Gulf wheat exports and ethanol shipments. Revenue gains were also achieved through additional shipments of sugar beets due to a favorable crop in 2003 and canned and packaged foods resulting from additional,
longer-haul shipments from the west coast. ARC grew due to the positive mix impact of longer average length of haul shipments, as well as price increases and fuel surcharges.

Automotive

–

Revenue growth in 2004 was attributable to increased volume of both finished vehicles, primarily from
international shippers, and automotive materials shipments. This was partially offset by a decline in shipments for domestic manufacturers due to lower production levels and weakened sales. ARC was up slightly in 2004 due to fuel surcharges and the
favorable impact of longer average length of haul.

Revenue
growth in 2003 was driven by additional volume due to market share gains for materials shipments, partially offset by a decline in revenues from domestic manufacturers, as the softening economy weakened demand for finished vehicles and forced
production cuts. ARC was up slightly in 2003, as price increases were partially offset by the mix impact of disproportionate growth in materials shipments, which move at a lower revenue per car than finished vehicles.

Chemicals

–

In 2004, liquid and dry chemical shipments were up due to
overall economic activity, led by intermediate chemicals and caustic soda. Soda ash, or sodium carbonate, which is an important raw material for manufacturing, moves increased due to strong domestic and export demand. Plastics showed increases in
both carloadings and revenue due to an improved economy and a stronger export market. ARC improved due to a mix shift toward longer average length of haul moves, increased shipments of high-ARC soda ash, and the positive effects of price increases
and fuel surcharges.

In 2003, reduced plastics volume led the
decline in carloads as the soft economy combined with higher input costs caused producers to lower inventories and reduce shipments. Growth of market demand for domestic and export soda ash partially offset the decline. ARC improved due to a mix
shift toward longer average length of haul moves, driven by fewer cars in storage-in-transit, in addition to price increases and fuel surcharges.

Energy

–

In 2004, overall volume was slightly down compared to record levels set in 2003. Volume increased 9% for business originating in Colorado due
to strong demand for western high-BTU coal. Supply constraints for eastern coal and imports will continue to increase the demand for western coal. Price increases and fuel surcharges drove ARC improvements but were offset by the mix impact of
shorter length of haul moves.

In 2003, strong utility demand
due to lower inventories in the last three quarters more than offset the absence of export traffic from the Colorado and Utah mining regions (as Japan was sourcing coal from other Far Eastern producers). ARC increased primarily due to index-based
contract escalators.

Industrial Products

–

Higher revenue
in 2004 was driven by growth in lumber, steel, and non-metallic minerals. Demand for lumber was driven by housing starts and continued low interest rates. Steel increased as strong global market demand limited imports and spurred demand for domestic
steel. ARC improved due to price increases, fuel surcharges, and more high-ARC lumber moves.

Revenue improvement in 2003 was attributable to government, steel, and lumber business growth. The increase in government shipments was driven by movement of military equipment and ammunition in support of the war
effort. Lumber positively impacted carloads, as housing starts and low interest rates continued to drive demand. Steel and scrap shipments also increased as the weakening dollar created higher domestic and export demand for U.S. produced steel,
augmented by market share gains. ARC rose due to price increases, fuel surcharges, and more high-ARC lumber moves, reflecting demand for building materials.

Intermodal

–

Revenue increased in 2004, driven by improved overall economic conditions and an increase in imports from the Far East, as more domestic
goods were manufactured or assembled overseas. ARC in 2004 improved due to fuel surcharges and price increases.

In 2003, carloads were up due to strong imports and improved economic conditions, as well as the year over year impact of the labor dispute between the
International Longshoreman and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and the



Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2002. ARC in 2003 improved due to fuel surcharges and price increases.

Mexico Business

–

Included in the commodity revenue
reported above is revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. This revenue grew 9% to $970 million in 2004 compared to a 2% increase to $893 million for 2003. Business gains in 2004 were led by increased volume in the industrial products, intermodal,
chemical, and automotive business groups, particularly cement, newsprint and wood fiber, liquid and dry chemicals, soda ash, and automotive materials. Revenue growth was also driven by an increase in agricultural revenues resulting from both higher
wheat exports and beer imports. A decline in export shipments of corn and feed grains, as well as a reduction in energy carloads, partially offset the increases. Growth in 2003 was led by market share gains in automotive materials shipments and
increased revenue for agricultural products resulting from higher corn and meal exports, as well as increased beer imports.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased in 2004
due to higher fuel prices, an asbestos charge of $247 million (pre-tax), higher crew and asset utilization costs resulting from slower network velocity, and volume-related costs. Expenses in 2004 were also negatively impacted by wage and benefit
inflation, additional training expenses associated with an increase in trainmen employment levels, increased depreciation expense, and higher casualty costs relating to a jury verdict upheld against the Railroad for a 1998 crossing accident and a
derailment in San Antonio, Texas in 2004. Our service issues, including increased hiring and training efforts, added approximately $300 million in operating expenses during 2004.

Operating expenses in 2003 were higher due to increased fuel prices, wage and benefit inflation, and volume-related costs as
well as higher operational costs resulting from a slower rail network in the third and fourth quarters of the year. These increases were mitigated somewhat by lower depreciation expense, a 2% reduction in employment levels, and cost control efforts.
Cost control efforts are defined as focused actions to reduce discretionary spending and failure costs.

Salaries, Wages, and Employee Benefits

–

The increase in 2004 was driven by wages and training expenses associated with an increase in trainmen employment levels, increased crew costs due to slower
network velocity, inflation, volume-related expenses, and severance costs associated with the relocation of various support functions to Omaha, Nebraska. Lower protection costs and performance-based compensation expense for management partially
offset these increases. Protection cost represents the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee’s “protected” rate of pay. An individual’s protected rate is imposed by the STB for
employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements. We also benefited from cost savings driven by a smaller non-transportation workforce during the year.

The increase in 2003 resulted from the adoption of FASB Statement No.143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(FAS 143), which accounted for $110 million of the increase. Other drivers included inflation, volume-related costs, protection costs, increased crew utilization costs due to a shortage of available
crews in the third and fourth quarters, as well as higher pension expense.

Equipment and Other Rents

–

Equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases;
other



specialty equipment leases; and office and other rentals. Expenses increased in 2004 due to an increase in carload volumes, which resulted in higher
locomotive and car rental expenses, and longer car cycle times resulting from slower network velocity. The higher locomotive expense includes additional costs associated with leasing short-term surge locomotive power, which is more costly than
long-term locomotive leases, and the increased leasing of new locomotives, which are being utilized for the higher business volumes and to improve network performance. Car cycle time is defined as the amount of time that a car spends on our system
without changing its loaded/unloaded status or having a new waybill issued.

Conversely, expenses decreased in 2003 due primarily to lower rental prices for private rail cars, partially offset by higher locomotive lease expense and increased car cycle times driven by higher inventory of cars
on the system due to slower network velocity in the third and fourth quarters of 2003.

Depreciation

– The majority of depreciation relates to track structure, including rail, ties, and other track material. Depreciation expense increased in 2004 primarily due to a higher depreciable asset base caused by higher
capital spending in recent years.

The 2003 decrease was driven
by the adoption of FAS 143, as well as the implementation of depreciation studies approved by the STB, which resulted in lower depreciation rates in 2003 for certain track assets, partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets.
The higher depreciable asset base partially offset the favorable impact of FAS 143 and the depreciation studies in 2003.

Fuel and Utilities

–

Fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel, utilities other than telephone, and gasoline and other fuels. The increases in 2004
and 2003 were driven by diesel fuel prices, which averaged $1.22, $0.92, and $0.73 per gallon in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively (including taxes and transportation costs), and higher gallons consumed on a year-over-year basis. The higher fuel
price in 2004 contributed $416 million to the increase; however, approximately 52% of these costs were recovered through our fuel surcharge programs and are included in operating revenues. The increase in gross ton-miles in 2004 and 2003 drove the
higher fuel usage resulting in an additional $24 million and $25 million in fuel expense in each year, respectively. The Railroad hedged approximately 9% and 13% of its fuel consumption for 2004 and 2003, in accordance with its hedging policy, which
decreased fuel costs by $14 million in 2004 and $28 million in 2003. Gasoline, utilities, and propane expenses increased $13 million in 2004 and $12 million in 2003 due to higher prices.

Materials and Supplies

–

Materials used for the maintenance of the Railroad’s lines, structures, and equipment is
the principal component of materials and supplies expense. Office, small tools and other supplies, and the costs of freight services purchased to ship company materials are also included. Expenses increased in 2004 due to increased use of locomotive
repair materials associated with maintaining a larger fleet that includes older units not covered by warranties, additional freight car repairs, higher materials costs, and increased freight charges for shipment of company material.

Conversely, expenses decreased in 2003 driven primarily by costs associated
with track removal as well as fewer locomotive repairs, cost control measures, and a shift to more contracting of locomotive repairs, which resulted in a corresponding increase to Purchased Services and Other Costs. The 2003 reduction was partially
offset by higher costs for locomotive materials.

Casualty Costs

–

Personal injury expense, freight and property damage, insurance, environmental matters, and asbestos expense are included in casualty costs. Costs in 2004 increased due to the asbestos charge of $247 million (pre-tax), higher personal
injury expense due to a 2002 jury verdict against the Railroad for a 1998 crossing accident that was upheld on appeal in 2004, and costs related to a 2004 derailment near San Antonio, Texas. These increases were partially offset by reduced personal
injury expense driven by lower than anticipated settlement costs and fewer employee injuries in 2004 than previously assumed, in addition to lower expense for our insurance programs.

Expenses in 2003 increased due to higher personal injury expense, insurance costs due to increased premiums, and expenses
associated with destruction of foreign equipment. Destruction of foreign equipment expense is incurred when equipment owned by other railroads is destroyed while in our possession.

Purchased Services and Other Costs

– Purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside
contractors, state and local taxes, net costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other



railroads, transportation and lodging for train crew employees, trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers, leased automobile maintenance
expenses, telephone and cellular expense, employee travel expense, and computer and other general expenses. Expenses increased in 2004 as a result of higher locomotive contract maintenance services, state and local taxes, relocation costs associated
with moving various support personnel to Omaha, Nebraska, and increased trucking expenses for intermodal carriers and crew transportation costs due to slower network velocity and additional volume.

Similarly, expenses rose in 2003 due to the drivers mentioned above in
addition to higher contract-related expenses resulting from the cost of track removal and joint facilities costs, which were up due to reduced haulage receipts and increased expenses associated with a new joint facility contract.

The following table shows operating income and non-operating financial
results for periods ended December 31:

Operating Income

–
Operating income decreased in 2004 as higher fuel prices, a $247 million pre-tax asbestos charge, resource utilization costs associated with sub-optimal network operations, volume-related expenses, wage and benefit inflation, training expenses, and
higher casualty costs more than offset annual revenue growth of 6%. Our service issues, including increased hiring and training efforts, added approximately $300 million in operating expenses during 2004.

Operating income in 2003 declined as productivity gains and lower
depreciation expense were more than offset by higher fuel prices, inflation, volume, and resource utilization costs experienced in the third and fourth quarters of 2003.

Non-Operating Items

Other Income –

The 2004 improvement in other income was a result of higher costs in 2003 associated with the early retirement of $1.5 billion of Convertible
Preferred Securities (CPS) and income recognized in 2004 from the sale of assets of a technology subsidiary, which were partially offset by lower gains from real estate sales in 2004.

The reduction in 2003 was primarily a result of higher 2002 real estate gains (transactions included sales to the Utah
Transit Authority with a pre-tax value of $141 million and the Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority with a pre-tax value of $73 million) and the negative impact of the 2003 CPS redemption costs.

Interest Expense –

The improvement in interest expense in 2004 and 2003 was
primarily due to declining weighted-average debt levels of $8.1 billion, $8.9 billion, and $9.5 billion in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, which included the CPS in 2003 and 2002. Our effective interest rate was 6.5% in 2004, compared to 6.4%
and 6.6% in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Income Taxes –

Income tax
expense decreased in 2004, driven by lower pre-tax income, a reduction in the deferred state income tax liability primarily attributable to relocating support operations to Omaha, Nebraska, state income tax credits earned in connection with the new
headquarters building in Omaha, and an increase in foreign tax credits resulting from the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

The decrease in 2003 was driven by lower pre-tax income, which was partially offset by a tax adjustment recognized in 2002 for prior years’ income
tax examinations. Our effective tax rate decreased to 29.4% in 2004 compared to 35.5% and 35.0% in 2003 and 2002, respectively.



DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On November 5, 2003, we
completed the sale of our entire trucking interest. Revenues from discontinued operations were $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income from discontinued operations was $255 million and $76 million in 2003 and 2002.
Income from discontinued operations in 2003 included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of $211 million, including an income tax benefit of $126 million.

OTHER OPERATING AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS

Railroad Performance Measures

We report key railroad
performance measures weekly to the American Association of Railroads, including carloads, average train speed, average daily inventory of rail cars on our system, and average terminal dwell time, which is a measure of the average time a rail car
spends (in hours) at our terminals. This operating data is available on our website at www.up.com/investors/reports/index.shtml.

Other Operating Statistics

Gross and Revenue
Ton-Miles

–

Gross and revenue ton-miles increased 2% and 3% respectively in 2004 driven by carloading growth of 2% during the same period. Gross and revenue ton-miles both increased 3% in 2003 with carloading growth of 1%. The
increase in gross and revenue ton-miles in 2003 was positively impacted by volume growth experienced in the higher density commodity groups of industrial products and chemicals, combined with a minimal increase in automotive carloads, which is a
lower density commodity. Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of a loaded or empty freight car by the number of actual miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are based on tariff miles and do not include the weight of the freight car.

Average Full-Time Equivalent Employees

–

The 2004 increase
in the average number of full-time equivalent employees resulted from the addition of train crew personnel, who were hired to handle increased customer demand and improve service. These additions were partially offset by increased productivity in
the non-transportation functions, employee attrition, and fewer employees at our technology subsidiaries. In 2003, the number of full-time equivalent employees decreased 2% due to productivity improvements and employee attrition.

Other Financial Statistics

Debt to Capital/Lease Adjusted Debt
to Capital

–

Debt to capital is computed by dividing total debt by total debt plus equity. Lease adjusted debt to capital is derived by dividing total debt plus the net present value of operating leases by total debt plus equity plus
the net present value of operating leases. We believe these measures are important in managing our capital structure to allow efficient access to the debt market while minimizing our cost of capital. The improvement in our 2004 debt to capital ratio
resulted from an increase in equity due to earnings, partially offset by an increase in our debt levels since year-end 2003. The increase in lease adjusted debt to capital was driven by higher debt levels and valuation of operating leases, which
were partially offset by higher equity.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December
31, 2004, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, the sale of receivables, and our revolving credit facilities, as well as issuance of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. We had
$2.0 billion of credit facilities available, of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004. The sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade credit rating. If
our credit rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the program was $590 million as of December 31, 2004. Access to commercial paper is
dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity. Liquidity through the capital
markets is also dependent on our financial stability.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had a working capital deficit of $226 million and $367 million, respectively. A working capital deficit is not uncommon in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. We maintain adequate resources to meet
our daily cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.

Financial Condition

Cash Provided by Operating
Activities –

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was driven by lower income from continuing operations and cash from discontinued operations recognized in 2003, which was partially offset by working capital
performance. The increase from 2002 to 2003 was due to working capital performance and higher cash from the discontinued operations, partially offset by lower income from continuing operations.

Cash Used in Investing Activities –

The increase in 2004 resulted from $620
million received in 2003 for the sale of our trucking interest, a large dividend from an affiliate in 2003, and reduced asset sales in 2004. The reduction in use of cash in 2003 was primarily driven by proceeds of $620 million from the sale of our
trucking interest, which was partially offset by lower proceeds from asset sales and increased 2003 capital spending.

Cash Used in Financing Activities –

The decrease in 2004 was driven by lower debt repayments of $588 million in 2004 compared to $2.1 billion in 2003
(including $1.5 billion of CPS) partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises ($102 million in 2004 compared to $216 million in 2003) and higher dividend payments ($310 million in 2004 versus $234 million in 2003). The
increase in 2003 reflects higher debt repayments of $2.1 billion in 2003 (including $1.5 billion of CPS) compared to $1.2 billion in 2002, and higher dividend payments, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises of $66
million.

The table below details capital expenditures for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, including non-cash capital lease financings of $188 million and $126 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. There were no non-cash capital lease financings in 2004.



In 2005, we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately $2 billion. These expenditures will
be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors, remove bottlenecks, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build and improve facilities and terminals, and
develop and implement new technologies. We expect to fund our 2005 capital expenditures through cash generated from operations, additional debt financings, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, and cash on hand at
December 31, 2004. We expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for 2005. In addition to cash capital expenditures, we expect to acquire locomotives and certain other equipment
through short- and long-term operating leases.

For the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 2.1, 3.2, and 3.4, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent income from continuing operations,
less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges. The decline in our
ratio was due primarily to lower income from continuing operations.

Financing Activities

Credit Facilities

– On
December 31, 2004, we had $2.0 billion in revolving credit facilities available, including $1.0 billion under a 364-day revolving facility expiring in March 2005 and $1.0 billion under a 5-year facility expiring in March 2009 (collectively, the
“facilities”). The facilities, which were entered into during March 2004, are designated for general corporate purposes and replaced a $925 million 364-day revolving credit facility that expired in March 2004 and a $1.0 billion 5-year
revolving credit facility, which was due to expire in March 2005. Neither of the facilities were drawn as of December 31, 2004. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably
rated investment-grade borrowers. Like the revolving credit facilities that were replaced, these facilities allow for borrowings at floating (LIBOR-based) rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The facilities do not
include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral. The facilities require the maintenance of minimum net worth and debt to net
worth coverage ratios. At December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with these covenants.

To the extent we have long-term credit facilities available, we have reclassified certain short-term debt to a long-term basis. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, approximately $440 million and $324 million of short-term
borrowings that we intend to refinance were reclassified as long-term debt. This reclassification reflects our intent to refinance these short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt on a long-term basis through the issuance of
commercial paper or new long-term financings, or by using the currently available long-term credit facility if alternative financing is not available. We are reviewing rollover options for the 364-day credit facility that expires in March 2005.

Dividend Restrictions

– Retained earnings available for dividends
decreased to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004, from $6.9 billion at December 31, 2003, due to revisions in minimum net worth requirements under the credit facilities referred to above. We do not expect that these restrictions will have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings

– On May 4, 2004, we issued the remaining $250 million available under a shelf registration statement filed in 2002. We issued 5.375% fixed rate
debt with a maturity of May 1, 2014. Also on May 4, 2004, we issued $250 million of 6.25% fixed rate debt with a maturity of May 1, 2034, under a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement filed in 2003. On November 23, 2004, we issued an additional
$250 million of 4.875% fixed rate debt with a maturity of January 15, 2015 under the 2003 shelf registration statement. The proceeds from the issuances were used for the repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes. Under the 2003 shelf
registration statement, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. At December 31, 2004, we had $500 million
remaining for issuance under the 2003 shelf registration statement. We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt
securities under this shelf registration.



Operating Lease Activities

As of December 31, 2004, our total aggregate contractual obligations for operating leases were approximately $3.4 billion. During 2004, the
Railroad entered into long-term operating lease arrangements covering 376 new locomotives. These new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately $506 million. The lessors of the locomotives were investors that
purchased the locomotives in various transactions for a total equipment cost of approximately $601 million. The Railroad also entered into similar long-term operating lease arrangements for freight cars with a total equipment cost of approximately
$53 million and minimum total rent payments of approximately $76 million.

The lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars, in part, by the issuance of equipment notes that are non-recourse to us and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a security
interest in the equipment. Neither the Railroad nor UPC guarantees payment of the equipment notes. The Railroad’s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position.

We have certain renewal and
purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars. Additionally, we have flexible return rights with respect to a portion of the locomotives. If we do not exercise any such options or flexible return rights, the equipment will be
returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term.

On
October 5, 2004, the Railroad completed the refinancing of a new headquarters building in Omaha, Nebraska, with a synthetic lease, which is an off-balance sheet financing arrangement (as discussed below). The lease has a term of 10 years with total
scheduled lease payments of approximately $134 million.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Commitments

As described in the
notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8, and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. However, based on our assessment of the underlying
provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off-balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty
that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, the commercial obligations, financings, and commitments made by us are customary
transactions that are similar to those of other comparable industrial corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.

The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004:

[a]

Excludes capital lease obligations of $1,416 million, unamortized discount of $105 million, and market value adjustments of $2 million for debt with qualifying hedges that are
recorded as assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

[b]

Represents total obligations, including interest component.

[c]

Purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for locomotives, ties, ballast, and track; and agreements to purchase other goods and
services.



[a]

None of the credit facilities were used as of December 31, 2004.

[b]

$590 million of the facility was utilized at December 31, 2004.

[c]

Includes guaranteed obligations of affiliated operations.

[d]

None of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of December 31, 2004.

Sale of Receivables

– The Railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, as
part of a sale of receivables facility. UPRI sells, without recourse on a 364-day revolving basis, an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors. The total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was
$600 million at December 31, 2004. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was $590 million at both December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by
investors is not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by $1,089 million and $1,048 million of accounts receivable held by UPRI at December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the value of the interest retained by UPRI was $499 million and $458 million, respectively. This retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our Consolidated Financial
Statements. The interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value, which approximates fair value, and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction.

The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible
receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks, including default and dilution. If default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point, the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by $6
million. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced, and, in certain cases, the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility.

The Railroad has been designated to service the sold receivables; however, no
servicing asset or liability has been recognized as the servicing fees adequately compensate the Railroad for its responsibilities. The Railroad collected approximately $12.2 billion and $11.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. UPRI used such proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility.

The costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were $11 million, $10 million, and $13 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The costs
include interest, program fees paid to banks, commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability.

The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad have no
recourse to the assets of UPRI. On August 5, 2004, the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional 364-day period without any significant changes in terms.

Headquarters Building

– On October 5, 2004, the Railroad completed the refinancing of the synthetic lease for the new
headquarters building. The Railroad will lease the building pursuant to an operating lease with a term of ten years. Total scheduled lease payments during the term are approximately $134 million. UPC has guaranteed the obligations of the Railroad
under the lease and, therefore, has a contingent liability for such obligations. The obligations of the Railroad to make lease payments are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements of



the Railroad or UPC. During the term of the lease, the Railroad may, at its option, purchase the building. Such purchase amount, which was $257.5 million,
will represent the cost of constructing the building, including capitalized interest and transaction expenses. Any such payment may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the outstanding debt, which will vary depending
on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment.

Upon expiration of the lease term, if the Railroad does not purchase the building or renew the lease, the building will be remarketed. The Railroad has guaranteed that the building will have a residual value equal to at least $206
million in the event that the building is remarketed. Therefore, the guarantee made by UPC with respect to the Railroad’s obligations under the lease is expected to represent a contingent obligation of approximately $206 million. At December
31, 2004, the Railroad had a liability of approximately $6 million related to the fair value of this guarantee.

The arrangement is subject to customary default provisions, including, without limitation, those relating to payment defaults under the lease and the
operative documents, the acceleration of certain other unrelated debt obligations of the Railroad or UPC, performance defaults, and events of bankruptcy. In the event that such defaults occur and are continuing, the Railroad (or UPC pursuant to its
guarantee) may be required to pay all amounts due under the lease through the end of the term of the lease.

OTHER MATTERS

Inflation

– The
cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital-intensive companies. As a result, assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an
inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest
rate objectives. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness
between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management
objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. We may use swaps, collars, futures, and/or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and to hedge
the exposure to variable cash flows. The use of these instruments also limits future benefits from favorable movements. The purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or
interest rate fluctuations.

Market and Credit Risk

–

We
address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, is
managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2004, we have not been required to provide collateral, nor have we received collateral relating to our hedging activities.

In addition, we enter into secured financings in which the debtor has pledged
collateral. The collateral is based upon the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor. We generally are not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults.

Determination of Fair Value

–

The fair values of our derivative financial
instrument positions at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were determined based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury
rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), or swap spread.

Sensitivity
Analyses –

The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not
consider other factors that could impact actual results.



Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges

–

We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by
adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. The mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as
incremental borrowings are required. Derivatives are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the
issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed-rate debt securities.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had variable-rate debt representing approximately 9% and 10%, respectively, of our total debt. If variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2005 than our December
31, 2004 variable rate, which was approximately 5%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $8 million. If variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in 2004 than our December 31, 2003 variable rate, which was
approximately 3%, our interest expense would have increased by approximately $7 million. This amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates
to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR). The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges using the short-cut method as allowed by
FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

;

therefore, no ineffectiveness has been recorded within our Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap on
$250 million of debt with a maturity of April 15, 2012. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of approximately $750 million and $818 million, respectively.

Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in
fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2004, and amounts to approximately $599 million at December 31, 2004. Market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease
in interest rates as of December 31, 2003, amounted to approximately $573 million at December 31, 2003. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and
current borrowing rates.

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges

–

In May 2004, in anticipation of a future lease transaction, we entered into treasury lock transactions with notional amounts totaling $125 million and an average locked-in rate of 5.08%. The treasury locks are accounted for as cash
flow hedges. On September 28, 2004, the treasury locks were settled in connection with a 10-year operating lease, commencing on October 5, 2004, and maturing on September 30, 2014. The settlement of these treasury lock transactions was based on a
treasury yield of 4.01% and resulted in a payment of $11 million to our counterparty that is being amortized to rent expense over the life of the 10-year operating lease. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges
outstanding.

Fuel Cash Flow Hedges

–

Fuel costs are a
significant portion of our total operating expenses. In 2004 and 2003, our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge program. However, we may use swaps, collars, futures and/or forward contracts to
further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes.

We
currently have no fuel hedges in place for 2005. As of December 31, 2003, collars were in place for 9% of expected fuel consumption for 2004. The collars had a floor of $0.64, a cap of $0.74, and a ceiling of $0.86 per gallon, excluding taxes,
transportation costs, and regional pricing spreads. Based on annualized fuel consumption during 2004, each one-cent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately $8.5 million of additional fuel expense, after tax. As of December
31, 2002, we hedged approximately 7% of our forecasted 2003 fuel consumption using fuel swaps at $0.58 per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs, and regional pricing spreads.

Accounting Pronouncements

– In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (R),

Share-Based Payment

. This statement,
which is effective for the Corporation beginning July 1, 2005, requires that companies recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or other share based payments. We anticipate the impact of this pronouncement will not
differ materially from what has been disclosed in our pro



forma net income located in our Significant Accounting Policies section of the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Item 8.

Asbestos

– We are a defendant in a
number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos. Additionally, we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated. The claims and lawsuits (collectively referred to as “claims”)
allege occupational illness resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products. In most cases, the claimants do not have credible medical evidence of physical impairment resulting from the alleged exposures. Additionally, most claims filed
against us do not specify an amount of alleged damages.

The
greatest potential for asbestos exposure in the railroad industry existed while steam locomotives were used. The railroad industry, including UPRR and its predecessors, phased out steam locomotives in approximately 1955-1960. The use of
asbestos-containing products in the railroad industry was substantially reduced after steam locomotives were discontinued, although it was not completely eliminated. Some asbestos-containing products were still manufactured in the building trade
industry and were used in isolated component parts on locomotives and railroad cars during the 1960s and 1970s. By the early 1980s, manufacturers of building materials and locomotive component parts developed non-asbestos alternatives for their
products and ceased manufacturing asbestos-containing materials.

Prior to 2004, we concluded it was not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of disposing of asbestos-related claims that might be filed against us in the future, due to a lack of sufficient comparable history from which to reasonably
estimate unasserted asbestos-related claims. As a result, we recorded a liability for asbestos-related claims only when the claims were asserted.

We believe we can now reasonably estimate a liability for unasserted asbestos-related claims because we have sufficient comparable loss data and there is
no immediate legislative solution to asbestos litigation. During 2004 we engaged a third-party expert with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos-related claims to assist us in assessing the number and value of these
unasserted claims through 2034, based on our average claims experience over a multi-year period. As a result, we increased our liability for asbestos-related claims to $326 million. At December 31, 2004, $17 million was classified as current
liabilities, while the remainder was classified as long-term accrued casualty costs. Approximately 14% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims, and approximately 86% related to unasserted claims. These claims are expected to be paid out
over the next 30 years. A summary of asbestos-related claims activity in recent years follows:

We have insurance
coverage that reimburses us for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos-related claims. At December 31, 2004, we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries.

We believe that our liability for asbestos-related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and
probable estimates. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, average settlement costs,
and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment, federal and state law governing compensation
of asbestos claimants, and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants.



Commitments and Contingencies

– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our
subsidiaries. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, pursuant to which we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites. We do not expect that any known
lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities
previously recorded for these matters.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of
revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, Item 8. These critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements may be material.

Asbestos

– We are a defendant in a
number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos. Additionally, we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated. A liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestos-related
claims through 2034 has been estimated and recorded. A third-party expert with experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos-related claims assisted us in assessing our potential liability. The liability for resolving both asserted and
unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:

•

The number of claims received in 2005 will be consistent with average claims received between 2000 and 2003.

•

The number of claims to be filed against us will decline each year after 2005.

•

The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to those experienced between 2002 and 2004.

•

The percentage of claims dismissed between 2002 and 2004 will continue through 2034.

As a result of the assessment for unasserted asbestos-related claims, we increased our liability for asbestos-related claims
to $326 million. At December 31, 2004, $17 million was classified as current liabilities, while the remainder was classified as long-term accrued casualty costs. Approximately 14% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and
approximately 86% related to unasserted claims. These claims are expected to be paid out over the next 30 years. We have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos-related claims and we have recognized an asset for
estimated insurance recoveries.

We believe that our liability
for asbestos-related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future
events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates may also vary
due to changes in the litigation environment, federal and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants, and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants.

Environmental

– We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified 384 sites at
which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 52 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the



U.S. government, 31 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the
remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.

When an environmental issue has been identified with respect to property
owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is
probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable.

Environmental expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002
were $46 million, $26 million, and $37 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had a liability of $201 million and $187 million, respectively, accrued for future environmental costs, of which $50 million and $57 million,
respectively, were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third
parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine
because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related
to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Personal Injury

– The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related
to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third-party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. Compensation
for work-related accidents is governed by the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA). Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and
rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work. Annual expenses for our personal injury-related events were $288 million in 2004, $250 million in 2003, and $221 million in 2002. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had a liability of
$639 million and $617 million accrued for future personal injury costs, respectively, of which $274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs in both years. Changes in estimates can vary due to evolving trends in
litigation related to personal injury cases.

Depreciation

– The
railroad industry is capital intensive. Properties are carried at cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight-line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property. The lives are calculated using a
separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group, based on the results of a depreciation study. We are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment
property and every six years for road property to the STB for review and approval. The cost (net of salvage) of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or
loss is recognized. A gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition. The cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five-year period. An obsolescence review of capitalized software
is performed on a periodic basis.

Capital spending in recent
years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets. Cash capital spending totaled $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. In 2003, we implemented depreciation studies, approved by the STB, resulting in lower depreciation
expense of $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to a reduction in depreciation rates for certain track assets (effective January 1, 2003), partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets (effective July 1,
2003). For the year ended December 31, 2004, depreciation expense was $1.1 billion. Various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property. Due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of
depreciable assets, variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would



decrease by approximately $37 million. If the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense
would increase by approximately $40 million.

Income Taxes

– We
account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.

As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted; the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated. Future tax law changes,
such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In determining
whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based in part on management’s judgments regarding the best available evidence
about future events. Based on that analysis, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $11 million against certain deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2004.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

– We use third-party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with
providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits (OPEB) to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to
measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets. For other postretirement benefits, the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate.

We evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected
assumptions are based on the following factors:

•

Discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans’ expected benefit payments.

•

Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions.

•

Healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions.

The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and OPEB expense for 2004 and the estimated impact
on 2004 pension and OPEB expense relative to a change in those assumptions:



RISK FACTORS

We Face Competition from Other
Railroads and Other Transportation Providers

– We are subject to competition from other railroads, which operate parallel routes in many of our traffic corridors, in addition to motor carriers and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and
pipelines. Competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing, as well as place a greater emphasis on the quality and reliability of the service provided. While we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and
barges are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate, or
legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We Have Experienced Service Difficulties, Which May Continue

– Due to
unprecedented demand for rail service, a shortage of train personnel and locomotives, and capacity constraints, we have experienced network difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity on our system, which have compromised the level of
service we provide to our customers in a competitive environment. Although we have taken steps to correct these difficulties, including hiring and training employees for train service, acquiring equipment, and the ongoing redesign of our
transportation plan to better manage traffic on our system, we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address our service difficulties. We also cannot be sure that we will not experience other difficulties related to network
capacity, dramatic and unplanned increases of demand for rail service in one or more of our commodity groups, or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We Are Subject
to Significant Governmental Regulation

– We are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state, and local authorities covering a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental (as discussed below), and other
matters. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Governments may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any
adverse effects that the change may have on our business. Economic re-regulation of the rail industry would negatively impact our ability to determine prices for rail services and reduce capital spending on our rail network, resulting in a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Also, some laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot provide assurance that we will
continue to be able to do so. In addition, one or more consolidations of Class I railroads could lead to future re-regulation of the rail industry.

Rising Fuel Costs Could Materially and Adversely Affect Our Business

– Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses. Diesel fuel
prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations. Significant price increases may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, fuel prices and supplies are affected by international, political, and economic circumstances. If a
fuel supply shortage were to arise from OPEC production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports, or otherwise, higher fuel prices could, despite our fuel surcharge programs, materially affect our operating results, financial condition, and
liquidity.

We Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and
Regulations

– Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal
of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our current operations, and we did so in our former operations. Environmental liability can
extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties currently owned and used by us. Environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by
adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. Although we have appropriately recorded
current and long-term liabilities for known future environmental costs, we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown, or future
environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.



The Majority of Our Employees Belong to Labor Unions, and Labor Agreements, Strikes, or Work Stoppages Could Adversely
Affect Our Operations

– We are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States. Under the collective bargaining round that began on November 1, 1999, 11 of the 14 major rail unions reached new
labor agreements. We are currently negotiating new agreements with the remaining three unions. On November 1, 2004, notices for the next round of negotiations were sent to all 14 unions by the National Railway Labor Conference on behalf of UPRR (and
other carriers in the conference). These legal notices state our desire to modify the current collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with
these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, or other slowdowns by the affected workers. If unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, we
could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, future national labor
agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase our costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity.

The Availability of Qualified Personnel Could
Adversely Affect Our Operations

– Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail
service. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We May Be Affected by
General Economic Conditions

– Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by us may have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial
condition, and liquidity.

We Utilize Capital Markets

– We rely on
the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of commercial paper from time to time and the sale of certain of our receivables. Market instability or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal
or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to commercial paper and reduce our credit ratings below investment grade, which would prohibit us from utilizing our sale of receivables program and significantly increase the cost of issuing
debt.

We Are Dependent on Two Key Domestic Suppliers of Locomotives –

Due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment and its production, there are high barriers of entry to potential new suppliers. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives,
we could experience a significant cost increase and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations.

We Rely on Technology and Technology Improvements in Our Business Operations –

We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business. If we do not
have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Additionally, if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software,
and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, safety failure, security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and
liquidity.

Severe Weather Could Result in Significant Business
Interruptions and Expenditures –

Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, fires, and floods, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and
decreased revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.

We May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures –

The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for
various claims and litigation related to labor and employment,



personal injury, property damage, environmental, and other matters. Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident
involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.

We May Be Affected by Acts of Terrorism, War, or Risk of War –

Our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, including rail cars
carrying hazardous materials, which we are required to transport under federal law, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk
of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase
dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses may not be available to us in the future.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Union Pacific Corporation, its Directors, and Shareholders:

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in common
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Table of Contents at Part IV, Item 15. These
consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and consolidated
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and
Subsidiary Companies at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in 2003.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to
the “Corporation”, “we”, “us”, and “our” mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which will be separately referred to herein as “UPRR” or the
“Railroad”.

Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

– The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of Union Pacific Corporation and all of its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies (20% to 50% owned) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Cash and Temporary Investments

– Temporary investments are stated at cost,
which approximates fair value, and consist of investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Materials and Supplies

– Materials and supplies are carried at the lower of average cost or market.

Property and Depreciation

– Properties are carried at cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight-line method based on
estimated service lives of depreciable property. The cost (net of salvage) of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized. A gain or loss
is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition. The cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five-year period. An obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

– We review long-lived assets,
including identifiable intangibles, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
are less than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows.

Revenue Recognition

– We recognize commodity revenues on a percentage-of-completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. Other revenue is
recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period.

Translation of Foreign Currency

– Our portion of the assets and liabilities related to foreign investments are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Unrealized adjustments are reflected within shareholders’ equity as
accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

Financial Instruments

– The carrying value of our non-derivative financial instruments approximates fair value. The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), or swap spread.

We periodically use derivative financial instruments, for other than trading purposes, to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and interest
rates.

Stock-Based Compensation

– At December 31, 2004, we had
several stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in note 7. We account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25

, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,

and related interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation expense related to stock option grants is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of our
common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense related to retention shares, stock units, and other incentive plans is reflected in net income. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per



share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,

to stock-based employee compensation. See note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of FASB Statement No. 123 (R),

Share-Based Payment,

related to the treatment of stock options. See note 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliation between basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share.

Earnings Per Share

– Basic
earnings per share (EPS) are calculated on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS include shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, stock-based awards, and the potential conversion
of the preferred securities where the conversion of such instruments would be dilutive.

Use of Estimates

– Our Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates and assumptions regarding certain assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
future results may differ from such estimates.

Income Taxes

– We
account for income taxes in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are: (1) to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and (2) to
recognize the future tax consequences (deferred taxes) associated with items of income or expense that are reported in an entity’s financial statements in different time periods than its tax returns. Deferred taxes are measured using current
tax law; future changes in tax laws are not anticipated, but such future changes could have a material impact on our financial condition or our results of operations.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

– We incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions and postretirement
health benefits. In order to measure the expense associated with these benefits, we must make various assumptions including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses, salary
increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and expected future healthcare costs. The assumptions used by us are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third-party actuaries to
assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability associated with these benefits.

Personal Injury

– The cost of injuries to employees and others on our property is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third-party actuaries
to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability.

Environmental

– When environmental issues have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform environmental
assessments on such property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when
the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable.



Asbestos

– We estimate a liability for asserted and unasserted asbestos-related claims based on an assessment
of the number and value of those claims. We use an external consulting firm to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability.

Differences in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Surface Transportation Board (STB) Accounting

–

STB accounting rules require that railroads
accrue the cost of removing track structure over the expected useful life of these assets. Railroads historically used this prescribed accounting for reports filed with both the STB and SEC. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

.

This statement was effective for us beginning January 1, 2003, and prohibits the accrual of removal costs unless there is a legal obligation to remove the track structure at the end of its
life. We concluded that we did not have a legal obligation to remove the track structure, and therefore, under generally accepted accounting principles, we could not accrue the cost of removal in advance. As a result, reports filed with the SEC will
reflect the expense of removing these assets in the period in which they are removed.

Change in Presentation

– Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 Consolidated Financial Statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported operating income or
net income, with the exception of reclassifications made to reflect the discontinued operations.

1. Operations and Segmentation

We have
one reportable business segment, operating primarily in the area of rail transportation through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, including its subsidiaries and rail affiliates. The Consolidated Financial
Statements for 2003 and 2002 also include discontinued trucking operations, consisting of Overnite Transportation Company (OTC) and Motor Cargo Industries, Inc. (Motor Cargo) (see note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the
reclassification of our trucking segment as a discontinued operation).

Continuing Operations

– UPRR is a Class I railroad that operates in the United States. Our operating results have included Southern Pacific Rail Corporation since October 1996. In addition, during 1997, the Railroad acquired an
ownership interest in a consortium that was granted a 50-year concession to operate the Pacific-North and Chihuahua Pacific lines in Mexico. The Railroad made an additional investment in the consortium in 1999 and currently holds a 26% ownership
interest in the consortium.

We have approximately 33,000 route
miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern United States gateways and providing several north/south corridors to key Mexican gateways. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated
schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and
across the Mexican and Canadian borders. Railroad freight is comprised of six commodity groups (percent of total commodity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004): agricultural (14%), automotive (11%), chemicals (15%), energy (20%),
industrial products (21%), and intermodal (19%).

Employees

–

Approximately 87% of our more than 48,000 full-time equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. Under the collective bargaining round that began on November 1, 1999, 11 of the 14 unions reached new labor agreements
with the railroads. We are currently negotiating new agreements with the remaining three unions. Existing agreements remain in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the Railway Labor Act’s procedures
(which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of Presidential intervention) are exhausted. The current agreements provide for periodic wage increases until new agreements are reached.

On November 1, 2004, notices for the next round of negotiations were sent to
all 14 unions by the National Railway Labor Conference on behalf of UPRR (and other carriers in the conference). These legal notices state our desire to modify the current collective bargaining agreements. Contract negotiations with the various
unions usually take place over an extended period of time and generally have not resulted in work stoppages.



Competition –

We are subject to competition from other railroads, motor carriers, and barge operators. Our
main rail competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. Its rail subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company, operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other competing railroads and
by motor carriers. Motor carrier competition is particularly strong with respect to five of our six commodity groups (excluding energy) due to shorter delivery times offered by such carriers. Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland
and Gulf Coast waterways, barge competition can be particularly pronounced, especially for grain and bulk commodities. Competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing, as well as place a greater emphasis on the quality and
reliability of the service provided. While we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the
quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Equipment Suppliers –

We are dependent on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives. Due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of this equipment and its production, there are high barriers of entry to potential new
suppliers. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives, we could experience a significant cost increase and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations.

Discontinued Operations

– The discontinued operations represent
the operations of OTC and Motor Cargo.

2. Financial Instruments

Strategy and Risk

– We use derivative financial instruments in
limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments
for speculative purposes. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We
formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. We
may use swaps, collars, futures, and/or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and to hedge the exposure to variable cash flows. The use of these instruments also limits future benefits from favorable movements.
The purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations.

Market and Credit Risk

– We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly
correlate with the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2004, we have not been
required to provide collateral, nor have we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities.

In addition, we enter into secured financings in which the debtor has pledged collateral. The collateral is based upon the nature of the financing and the
credit risk of the debtor. We generally are not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults.

Determination of Fair Value

– The fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were determined based upon
current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate, LIBOR, or swap spread.

Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges

– We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations
in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. The mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as
debt matures or as incremental borrowings are required. Derivatives are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted



mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and
managing outstanding callable fixed-rate debt securities.

Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR). The swaps have been accounted for
using the short-cut method as allowed by FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

; therefore, no ineffectiveness has been recorded within our Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2004, we
entered into an interest rate swap on $250 million of debt with a maturity of April 15, 2012.

The following is a summary of our interest rate derivatives qualifying as fair value hedges:

Interest Rate Cash Flow
Hedges

– Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the hedged item.

In May 2004, in anticipation of a future lease transaction, we entered into treasury lock transactions with notional amounts
totaling $125 million and an average locked-in rate of 5.08%. The treasury locks are accounted for as cash flow hedges. On September 28, 2004, the treasury locks were settled in connection with a 10-year operating lease, commencing on October 5,
2004, and maturing on September 30, 2014. The settlement of these treasury lock transactions was based on a treasury yield of 4.01% and resulted in a payment of $11 million to our counterparty that is being amortized to rent expense over the life of
the 10-year operating lease. The unamortized portion of the payment is recorded as a $7 million after-tax reduction to common shareholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding.

Fuel Cash Flow
Hedges

– Fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses. In 2004 and 2003, our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge program. However, we may use swaps, collars,
futures, and/or forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes. We currently have no fuel hedges in place for 2005.

The following is a summary of our fuel derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges:

[a]

Excludes taxes, transportation costs, and regional pricing spreads.



Fuel hedging positions qualifying as cash flow hedges would be reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to fuel expense over the life of the hedge as fuel is consumed. At December 31, 2004, no amounts were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with our fuel hedges because no fuel hedges were outstanding.

Earnings Impact

– Our use of derivative financial instruments had
the following impact on pre-tax income for the years ended December 31:

Fair Value of Debt Instruments

– The fair value of our short- and long-term debt was estimated using quoted market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of total debt exceeded the carrying value by approximately
$673 million and $727 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, approximately $282 million and $375 million, respectively, of fixed-rate debt securities contained call provisions that allowed us to retire the debt instruments prior to
final maturity, with the payment of fixed call premiums, or in certain cases, at par.

Sale of Receivables

– The Railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, as part of a sale of receivables facility. UPRI sells, without recourse on a
364-day revolving basis, an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors. The total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was $600 million at December 31, 2004. The value of the outstanding undivided
interest held by investors under the facility was $590 million at both December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The value of
the undivided interest held by investors was supported by $1,089 million and $1,048 million of accounts receivable held by UPRI at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the value of the
interest retained by UPRI was $499 million and $458 million, respectively. This retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value, which
approximates fair value, and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction.

The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks, including
default and dilution. If default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point, the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by $6 million. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, the value of the outstanding
undivided interest held by investors would be reduced, and, in certain cases, the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility.

The Railroad has been designated to service the sold receivables; however, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized as the servicing fees
adequately compensate the Railroad for its responsibilities. The Railroad collected approximately $12.2 billion and $11.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. UPRI used such proceeds to purchase new receivables
under the facility.

The costs of the sale of receivables
program are included in other income and were $11 million, $10 million, and $13 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The costs include interest, program fees paid to banks, commercial paper issuing
costs, and fees for unused commitment availability.



The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and
indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad have no recourse to the assets of UPRI. On August 5, 2004, the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional 364-day period without any significant changes in terms.

3. Income Taxes

Components of income tax expense for continuing operations were as follows for the years ended December 31:

For the years ending
December 31, reconciliation between statutory and effective tax rates for continuing operations is as follows:

Deferred income tax
liabilities (assets) were comprised of the following at December 31:

All federal income tax
years prior to 1986 are closed. Federal income tax liabilities for 1986 through 1994 have been resolved, with the exception of minor refund claims for non-conventional fuel source credits claimed by Union Pacific Resources Corporation, Inc., a
former subsidiary. Resolution of the issues for these years resulted in a decrease in income tax expense for continuing operations of $33 million in 2002. Interest calculations for these years are in process and may take several years to resolve
with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).



The IRS has substantially completed its examination of the Corporation’s federal income tax returns
for the years 1995 through 1998 and has issued a preliminary Notice of Deficiency. Specifically, the IRS proposes to disallow 100% of the deductions claimed in connection with certain donations of property during those years. The Corporation
disputes the proposed adjustments and intends to defend its position through applicable IRS procedures, and, if necessary, litigation.

The federal income tax returns for years 1999 through 2002 are currently under examination by the IRS.

The Corporation believes it has adequately reserved for federal and state
income taxes, and does not expect that resolution of these examinations will have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.

4. Debt

Total debt as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, including interest rate swaps designated as hedges, is summarized below:

[a]

2004 and 2003 include a collective write-up of $2 million and $19 million, respectively, due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges that are recorded as
assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Debt Maturities

– The following table presents aggregate debt maturities as of December 31, 2004, excluding market value adjustments. Short-term borrowings that were reclassified as long-term debt are shown at their stated
maturities.

In February 2004, we
called our 4.25% mortgage bonds, with an outstanding balance of approximately $92 million and maturity date of January 1, 2005, for redemption in April 2004.

Mortgaged Properties

– Equipment with a carrying value of approximately $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, serves as
collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment.



As a result of the merger of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MPRR) with and into UPRR on January 1,
1997, and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the MPRR mortgage bonds, UPRR must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds. As of the merger date, the value of
the MPRR assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately $5.8 billion. In accordance with the terms on the indentures, this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding
balance of such bonds.

Credit Facilities

– On December 31, 2004,
we had $2.0 billion in revolving credit facilities available, including $1.0 billion under a 364-day revolving facility expiring in March 2005 and $1.0 billion under a 5-year facility expiring in March 2009 (collectively, the
“facilities”). The facilities, which were entered into during March 2004, are designated for general corporate purposes and replaced a $925 million 364-day revolving credit facility that expired in March 2004 and a $1.0 billion 5-year
revolving credit facility, which was due to expire in March 2005. Neither of the facilities were drawn as of December 31, 2004. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably
rated investment-grade borrowers. Similar to the revolving credit facilities that were replaced, these facilities allow for borrowings at floating (LIBOR-based) rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The facilities
do not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral. The facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a
debt to net worth coverage ratio. At December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with these covenants.

To the extent we have long-term credit facilities available, we have reclassified certain short-term debt to a long-term basis. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, approximately $440 million and $324 million of short-term borrowings that we intend to refinance were reclassified as long-term debt. This reclassification reflects our intent to refinance these short-term borrowings and current maturities of
long-term debt on a long-term basis through the issuance of commercial paper or new long-term financings, or by using the currently available long-term credit facility if alternative financing is not available. We are reviewing rollover options for
the 364-day credit facility that expires in March 2005.

Redemption of
Convertible Preferred Securities

– During 2003, we exercised our option to redeem the entire $1.5 billion of Convertible Preferred Securities (CPS). The CPS were issued in April 1998 by our wholly owned subsidiary, Union Pacific Capital
Trust, at a price of $50 each and paid quarterly cash dividends at an annual rate of 6.25%. The redemption was funded with a combination of cash from operations, the issuance of $500 million of debt in June 2003, and cash proceeds from the initial
public offering of Overnite. The $1.5 billion redemption, net of the $500 million debt issuance, reduces interest expense by approximately $71 million, pre-tax, annually and eliminates the dilutive effect of the CPS on earnings per share. Total
one-time costs incurred in 2003 associated with the redemption were approximately $45 million and are included in other income.

Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings

– On May 4, 2004, we issued the remaining $250 million available under a shelf registration
statement filed in 2002. We issued 5.375% fixed rate debt with a maturity of May 1, 2014. Also on May 4, 2004, we issued $250 million of 6.25% fixed rate debt with a maturity of May 1, 2034, under a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement filed in
2003. On November 23, 2004, we issued an additional $250 million of 4.875% fixed rate debt with a maturity of January 15, 2015 under the 2003 shelf registration statement. The proceeds from the issuances were used for the repayment of debt and other
general corporate purposes. Under the 2003 shelf registration statement, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings.
At December 31, 2004, we had $500 million remaining for issuance under the 2003 shelf registration statement. We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or
access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration.

During May 2003, we entered into a capital lease covering new locomotives. The related capital lease obligation totaled approximately $188 million and is included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position
as debt.

Dividend Restrictions

– We are subject to certain
restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained earnings available for dividends decreased to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004, from $6.9 billion at December 31, 2003, due to revisions in minimum
net worth requirements under our



credit facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend by 30% to 30 cents per share. We declared
dividends of $312 million in 2004 and $252 million in 2003.

5. Leases

We lease certain locomotives, freight cars, and other property. Future
minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2004 were as follows:

Rent expense for
operating leases with terms exceeding one month was $651 million in 2004, $586 million in 2003, and $585 million in 2002. Contingent rentals and sub-rentals are not significant.

6. Retirement Plans

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Pension Plans –

We provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans.
Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements.

Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) –

We provide defined contribution medical
and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. These benefits are funded as medical claims and life insurance premiums are paid.

Funded Status

Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO)

–

The PBO of our pension plans is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future salary increases. The
PBO of the OPEB plan is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation, as the present value of OPEB liabilities is not affected by salary increases. Changes in our projected benefit obligation are as follows for the years ended December 31:



Assets

–

Plan assets are measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our plan
assets are as follows for the years ended December 31:

Funded Status –

The funded
status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets. Below is a reconciliation of the funded status of the benefit plans to the net amounts recognized for the years ended December 31:

Amounts Recorded in Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position –

The following table presents the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position for the years ended December 31:

At both December 31,
2004 and 2003, $35 million of the total pension and other postretirement liabilities were classified as current.



Unfunded Accumulated Benefit Obligation

–

The accumulated benefit obligation is the present value of
benefits earned to date, assuming no future salary growth. The unfunded accumulated benefit obligation represents the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The projected benefit obligation,
accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of the plan assets were as follows for the years ended December 31:

The accumulated
benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Assumptions –

The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:

Expense

Both pension and OPEB expense are determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits
(the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period) and the interest cost on those liabilities, less the expected return on plan assets. With respect to the value of pension plan assets, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is
applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of
differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. The expected rate of return on assets was 8% for both 2004 and 2003.

Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized immediately, but are deferred and, if
necessary, amortized as pension or OPEB expense.



The components of our net periodic pension and other postretirement costs (income) were as follows for
the years ended December 31:

Assumptions –

The
weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine expense were as follows for the years ended December 31:

The discount rate is
based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans’ expected benefit payments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into account
current and expected market conditions. The actual return on pension plan assets was approximately 12% in 2004, compared to 25% in 2003. Our historical annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets is approximately 10%.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense
and liabilities reported for healthcare plans. The healthcare cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. A one-percentage point change in the expected healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects on
OPEB:

Equity Adjustment

An additional minimum pension liability adjustment is required when our accumulated
benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of our plan assets, and that difference exceeds the net pension liability recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The liability was recorded as a $212 million and $109 million
after-tax reduction to common shareholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2004 and 2003, respectively.



The equity reduction may be restored to the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan
assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligations. This reduction to equity does not affect net income or cash flow and has no impact on compliance with debt covenants.

Cash Contributions

The following table details our cash contributions for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the expected contributions for 2005:

Our policy with
respect to funding the qualified plans is to fund at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and not more than the maximum amount deductible for tax purposes. We do not currently have minimum
funding requirements, as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws. All contributions made to the funded pension plans for 2003 and 2004 were voluntary and were made with cash generated from operations.

All benefit payments for other postretirement benefits are voluntary, as the
postretirement plans are not funded, and are not subject to any minimum regulatory funding requirements. Benefit payments for each year represent claims paid for medical and life insurance, and we anticipate our 2005 OPEB payments will be made from
cash generated from operations.

Benefit Payments

The following table details expected benefit payments for the years 2005 though 2014:

Medicare Reform Act

On December 13, 2003, Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Reform Act). The provisions of the Medicare Reform Act include prescription drug benefits for Medicare eligible individuals. We elected to recognize this legislation in 2003, in accordance with
FASB Staff Position No. 106-1,

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

,

resulting in a $47 million reduction to the accumulated benefit obligation for
other postretirement benefits as of December 31, 2003. This reduction was based on the value of the projected federal subsidy, assumes no changes in participation rates, and was recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain. The estimated reduction in
post-65 per capita claim costs was 17%. There was no effect on 2003 expense. For 2004, we experienced a reduction in OPEB expense of $7 million. Future guidance from either Congress or the FASB could result in a change to this recognition.



Asset Allocation Strategy

Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and target allocation for 2005, are as follows:

The investment
strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve our target of an average long-term rate of return of 8%. While we believe we can achieve a long-term average rate of return of 8%, we cannot be
certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations. Assets are strategically allocated between equity and debt securities in order to achieve a diversification level that mitigates wide swings in investment returns. To further improve
diversification, a target allocation to real estate investments has been established for future time periods. Asset allocation target ranges for equity, debt, and other portfolios are evaluated at least every three years with the assistance of an
external consulting firm. Actual asset allocations are monitored monthly, and rebalancing actions are executed at least quarterly, if needed.

The majority of the plan’s assets are invested in equity securities, because equity portfolios have historically provided higher returns than debt
and other asset classes over extended time horizons and are expected to do so in the future. Correspondingly, equity investments also entail greater risks than other investments. The risk of loss in the plan’s equity portfolio is mitigated by
investing in a broad range of equity types. Equity diversification includes large-capitalization and small-capitalization companies, growth-oriented and value-oriented investments, and U.S. and non-U.S. securities.

Equity risks are further balanced by investing a significant portion of the
plan’s assets in high quality debt securities. The average quality rating of the debt portfolio exceeded AA as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The debt portfolio is also broadly diversified and invested primarily in U.S. Treasury, mortgage, and
corporate securities with an intermediate average maturity. The weighted-average maturity of the debt portfolio was 6.3 years at December 31, 2004 and 6.1 years as of December 31, 2003.

The investment of pension plan assets in our securities is specifically prohibited for both the equity and debt portfolios,
other than through index fund holdings.

Other Retirement Programs

Thrift Plan

–

We provide a defined
contribution plan (thrift plan) to eligible non-union employees and make matching contributions to the thrift plan. We match 50 cents for each dollar contributed by employees up to the first six percent of compensation contributed. Our thrift plan
contributions were $12 million in both 2004 and 2003 and $10 million in 2002.

Railroad Retirement System

–

All Railroad employees are covered by the Railroad Retirement System (the System). On December 21, 2001, The Railroad Retirement and Survivors’ Improvement Act of
2001 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act was a result of historic cooperation between rail management and labor, and provides improved railroad retirement benefits for employees and reduced payroll taxes for employers. Contributions made to the
System are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $569 million in 2004, $562 million in 2003, and $595 million in 2002.



Collective Bargaining Agreements –

Under collective bargaining agreements, we participate in multi-employer
benefit plans that provide certain postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits for eligible union employees. Premiums under the plans are expensed as incurred and amounted to $30 million in 2004, $27 million in 2003, and $16 million in
2002.

7. Stock Options and Other Stock Plans

We have 6,546,765 options outstanding under the 1993 Stock Option and Retention Stock Plan of
Union Pacific Corporation (1993 Plan). There are 5,100 retention stock units (the right to receive shares of common stock) outstanding under the 1993 Plan. There are 7,140 restricted shares outstanding under the 1992 Restricted Stock Plan for
Non-Employee Directors of Union Pacific Corporation. We no longer grant options or awards of restricted stock or retention shares and stock units under these plans.

The UP Shares Stock Option Plan of Union Pacific Corporation (UP Shares Plan

)

was approved by our Board of Directors
on April 30, 1998. The UP Shares Plan reserved 12,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance. The UP Shares Plan was a broad-based option program that granted options to purchase 200 shares of our common stock at $55.00 per share to eligible
active employees on April 30, 1998. All options granted were non-qualified options that became exercisable on May 1, 2001, and remain exercisable until April 30, 2008. If an optionee’s employment terminates for any reason, the option remains
exercisable for a period of one year after the date of termination, but no option is exercisable after April 30, 2008. No further options may be granted under the UP Shares Plan. As of December 31, 2004, there were 4,441,118 options outstanding
under the UP Shares Plan.

We adopted the Executive Stock
Purchase Incentive Plan (ESPIP), effective October 1, 1999, in order to encourage and facilitate ownership of our common stock by our officers and other key executives. Under the ESPIP, participants purchased a total of 1,008,000 shares of our
common stock with the proceeds of 6.02% interest-bearing, full recourse loans from the Corporation. Loans totaled $47 million and have a final maturity date of January 31, 2006. Deferred cash payments were to be awarded to the participants to repay
interest and the loan principal if certain performance and retention criteria were met within a 40-month period ending January 31, 2003. Following satisfaction of the various performance criteria during the term of the ESPIP and continued employment
with the Corporation through January 31, 2003, participants received a deferred cash payment equal to two-thirds of the outstanding principal balance of their loan plus the net accrued interest on January 31, 2003. Such payments were applied against
the participants’ outstanding loan balance pursuant to the terms of the ESPIP. The remaining balance of the loan is payable in three equal installments on January 31, 2004, January 31, 2005, and January 31, 2006. At December 31, 2004 and 2003,
the total outstanding balance of the remaining loans was $1 million and $8 million, respectively.

In April 2000, the shareholders approved the Union Pacific Corporation 2000 Directors Plan (Directors Plan) whereby 550,000 shares of our common stock
were reserved for issuance to our non-employee directors. Under the Directors Plan, each non-employee director, upon his or her initial election to the Board of Directors, receives a grant of 1,000 shares of restricted shares or restricted stock
units. Additionally, each non-employee director receives annually an option to purchase at fair value a number of shares of our common stock, not to exceed 5,000 shares during any calendar year, determined by dividing 60,000 by


/


of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of such Board of Directors meeting, with the
resulting quotient rounded up or down to the nearest 50 shares. As of December 31, 2004, 5,000 restricted shares were outstanding under the Directors Plan and 128,350 options were outstanding under the Directors Plan.

In November 2000, our Board of Directors approved the 2001 Long Term Plan
(LTP). Participants were awarded retention shares or stock units and cash awards subject to the attainment of certain performance targets and continued employment through January 31, 2004, or other applicable vesting dates. The LTP performance
criteria included three year (for fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003) cumulative earnings per share and stock price targets. We met the cumulative earnings per share target at December 31, 2003, which entitled participants to receive a total of
88,140 shares, 371,712 stock units, and $32 million at January 31, 2004, or other applicable vesting dates, totaling 48% of the maximum amount available under the LTP.

The Union Pacific Corporation 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (2001 Plan) was approved by the shareholders in April 2001. The 2001
Plan reserved 12,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance to eligible employees of



the Corporation and its subsidiaries in the form of non-qualified options, incentive stock options, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus
awards. Non-employee directors are not eligible for awards under the 2001 Plan. As of December 31, 2004, 6,387,500 options and 1,247,125 retention shares and stock units were outstanding under the 2001 Plan.

The Union Pacific Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (2004 Plan) was
approved by shareholders in April 2004. The 2004 Plan reserved 21,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to awards made under the 2001 Plan and the 1993 Plan that were outstanding on April 16, 2004, and became
available for regrant pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Plan. Under the 2004 Plan, non-qualified options, stock appreciation rights, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation
and its subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are not eligible for awards under the 2004 Plan. As of December 31, 2004, 18,400 options and 13,050 retention shares and stock units were outstanding under the 2004 Plan.

Pursuant to the above plans, 21,571,309, 6,899,211, and 9,544,569 shares of
our common stock were available for grant at December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Options

– Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of the grant. Options are granted with a 10-year term and are generally
exercisable one to two years after the date of the grant. A summary of the stock options issued under the 1993 Plan, the UP Shares Plan, the Directors Plan, the 2001 Plan, and the 2004 Plan, and changes during the years ending December 31 are as
follows:

The following table
summarizes information about our outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2004:



The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions for options granted in 2004, 2003, and 2002.

Restricted Stock and Other
Incentive Plans

– Our plans provide for awarding retention shares of common stock or stock units to eligible employees. These awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates during the prescribed retention period, generally three
or four years, or, in some cases, if a certain prescribed stock price or other financial criterion is not met. Restricted stock awards are issued to non-employee directors and are subject to forfeiture if certain service requirements are not met.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, 276,575 retention shares, stock units, and restricted shares were issued at a weighted-average fair value of $64.75. During the year ended December 31, 2003, 380,786 retention shares, stock units, and
restricted shares were issued at a weighted-average fair value of $55.99. During 2002, 804,956 retention shares, stock units, and restricted shares were issued at a weighted-average fair value of $58.21. The cost of retention and restricted awards
is amortized to expense over the retention period.

Under the
LTP, 11,900 performance retention stock units were issued at a weighted-average fair value of $60.97 during 2002. The cost of the LTP was marked to market and expensed over the performance period, which ended January 31, 2004.

The cost associated with the ESPIP retention criterion was amortized to
expense over the 40-month period. The cost associated with the ESPIP first performance criterion is expensed over the life of the loan, and the cost associated with the second performance criterion was expensed in December 2002.

During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, we expensed $21
million, $46 million, and $50 million, respectively, related to the other incentive plans described above.



8. Earnings Per Share

The following table provides a reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31:

Common stock options
totaling 3.3 million and 2.3 million for 2004 and 2002, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of these options exceeded the average market price of our common stock for the
respective periods, and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. All stock options were dilutive for 2003.

9. Commitments and Contingencies

Unasserted Claims

– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. It is not possible at this time for us to determine
fully the effect of all unasserted claims on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; however, to the extent possible, where unasserted claims can be estimated and where such claims are considered probable, we have
recorded a liability. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or
liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters.

Personal Injury

– The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third-party actuaries to
assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. Compensation for work-



related accidents is governed by the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA). Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through
litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work. Annual expenses for our personal injury-related events were $288 million in 2004, $250 million in
2003, and $221 million in 2002. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had a liability of $639 million and $617 million, respectively, accrued for future personal injury costs, of which $274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued
casualty costs for each year.

Asbestos

– We are a defendant in a
number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos. Additionally, we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated. The claims and lawsuits (collectively referred to as “claims”)
allege occupational illness resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products. In most cases, the claimants do not have credible medical evidence of physical impairment resulting from the alleged exposures. Additionally, most claims filed
against us do not specify an amount of alleged damages.

The
greatest potential for asbestos exposure in the railroad industry existed while steam locomotives were used. The railroad industry, including UPRR and its predecessors, phased out steam locomotives in approximately 1955-1960. The use of
asbestos-containing products in the railroad industry was substantially reduced after steam locomotives were discontinued, although it was not completely eliminated. Some asbestos-containing products were still manufactured in the building trade
industry and were used in isolated component parts on locomotives and railroad cars during the 1960s and 1970s. By the early 1980s, manufacturers of building materials and locomotive component parts developed non-asbestos alternatives for their
products and ceased manufacturing asbestos-containing materials.

During 2004, we engaged a third-party expert with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos-related claims to assist us in assessing the number and value of these unasserted claims through 2034, based on our average
claims experience over a multi-year period. As a result, we increased our liability for asbestos-related claims to $326 million. At December 31, 2004, $17 million was classified as current liabilities, while the remainder was classified as long-term
accrued casualty costs. Approximately 14% of the recorded liability related to pending claims, and approximately 86% related to future claims. These claims are expected to be paid out over the next 30 years. Payments for asbestos-related claims were
$14.1 million, $14.4 million, and $12.4 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Aggregate payments totaled $118.3 million, $104.2 million, and $89.8 million at December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

We have insurance coverage that reimburses us for a portion of the costs
incurred to resolve asbestos-related claims. At December 31, 2004, we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries.

We believe that our liability for asbestos-related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates. The amounts
recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues
could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment, federal and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants, and the
level of payments made to claimants by other defendants.

Environmental
Costs

– We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified approximately 384 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for
violations of environmental requirements. This includes 52 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 31 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several
liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.

When an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property
owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is



probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not
fixed or readily determinable.

As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, we had a liability of $201 million and $187 million, respectively, accrued for future environmental costs, of which $50 million and $57 million were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs. The liability includes future costs
for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as for ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially
responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability. However, the ultimate liability for remediation is
difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of
volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Remediation of identified sites previously used in operations, used by
tenants or contaminated by former owners required cash spending of $42 million in 2004, $36 million in 2003, and $68 million in 2002. We also engage in capital spending designed to reduce emissions and prevent spills and releases of hazardous
materials. We spent cash of $8 million in both 2004 and 2003 and $6 million in 2002 for these control and prevention measures. In 2005, we anticipate spending $50 million for remediation and $8 million for control and prevention. The impact of
current obligations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.

Purchase Obligations and Guarantees

– We periodically enter into financial and other commitments in connection with our businesses. We do not expect that these commitments or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

At December 31, 2004, we were contingently liable for $485 million in guarantees and $56 million in letters of credit. These contingent guarantees were entered into in the normal course of business and include guaranteed obligations of
affiliated operations. None of the guarantees individually is significant, and a liability of $6 million has been recorded for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2004. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any
existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees.

Headquarters Building

– On October 5, 2004, the Railroad completed the refinancing of the synthetic lease for the new headquarters building. The Railroad will lease the building pursuant to an operating lease with a term of ten
years. Total scheduled lease payments during the term are approximately $134 million. UPC has guaranteed the obligations of the Railroad under the lease and, therefore, has a contingent liability for such obligations. The obligations of the Railroad
to make lease payments are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Railroad or UPC. During the term of the lease, the Railroad may, at its option, purchase the building. Such purchase amount will represent the cost of
constructing the building, including capitalized interest and transaction expenses, which was $257.5 million. Any such payment may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the outstanding debt, which will vary depending
on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment.

Upon
expiration of the lease term, if the Railroad does not purchase the building or renew the lease, the building will be remarketed. The Railroad has guaranteed that the building will have a residual value equal to at least $206 million in the event
that the building is remarketed. Therefore, the guarantee made by UPC with respect to the Railroad’s obligations under the lease is expected to represent a contingent obligation of approximately $206 million. At December 31, 2004, the Railroad
had a liability of approximately $6 million related to the fair value of this guarantee.

The arrangement is subject to customary default provisions, including, without limitation, those relating to payment defaults under the lease and the operative documents, the acceleration of certain other unrelated
debt obligations of the Railroad or UPC, performance defaults and events of bankruptcy. In the event that such defaults occur and are continuing, the Railroad (or UPC pursuant to its guarantee) may be required to pay all amounts due under the lease
through the end of the term of the lease.



10. Other Income

Other income included the following:

Included in the 2002
gain on non-operating asset dispositions was a pre-tax gain of $141 million related to the sale of land, track, operating rights, and facilities to the Utah Transit Authority for $185 million, which included approximately 175 miles of track that
stretches from Brigham City, Utah, through Salt Lake City, Utah, south to Payson, Utah. The transaction contributed $88 million to our earnings on an after-tax basis.

Also included in the 2002 gain on non-operating asset dispositions was a pre-tax gain of $73 million related to the sale of
land and track to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority for $80 million, which included approximately 15 miles of track that stretches from William Street in San Jose, California, north to Paseo Padre Parkway in Fremont, California. The
transaction contributed $45 million to our earnings on an after-tax basis.

11. Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB
issued Statement No. 123 (R),

Share-Based Payment

.

This statement, which is effective for the Corporation beginning July 1, 2005, requires that companies recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or other
share-based payments. We anticipate the impact of this pronouncement will not differ materially from what has been disclosed in our pro forma net income located in our Significant Accounting Policies section of this Item 8.

12. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

STB accounting rules require that railroads accrue the cost of removing track structure over
the expected useful life of these assets. Railroads historically used this prescribed accounting for reports filed with both the STB and SEC. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(FAS
143). This statement was effective for us beginning January 1, 2003, and prohibits the accrual of removal costs unless there is a legal obligation to remove the track structure at the end of its life. We concluded that we did not have a legal
obligation to remove the track structure, and therefore, under generally accepted accounting principles, we could not accrue the cost of removal in advance. As a result, reports filed with the SEC will reflect the expense of removing these assets in
the period in which they are removed. For STB reporting requirements only, we will continue to follow the historical method of accruing in advance, as prescribed by the STB. FAS 143 also requires us to record a liability for legally obligated asset
retirement costs associated with tangible long-lived assets. In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded income from a cumulative effect of accounting change, related to the adoption of FAS 143, of $274 million, net of income tax expense of $167
million. The accounting change had no effect on our liquidity. Had the change been retroactively applied, the change would not have had a material impact on net income and earnings per share.

13. Discontinued Operations

On November 5, 2003, we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest through an initial
public offering. As part of the offering, we received cash proceeds of $620 million, including a dividend from Overnite of $128 million. As part of the transaction, Overnite forgave our intercompany payable to them of $227 million, and we received a
$1 million promissory note. We recorded a gain on the sale of $211 million, including an income tax benefit of $126 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The tax benefit recognized in 2003 was associated with



Overnite goodwill written off in the fourth quarter of 1998. Revenues from discontinued operations were $1,241 million and $1,332 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income before income taxes from discontinued operations was $74 million and $71 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

14. Subsequent Event

In early January 2005, a massive storm hit California and Nevada. Our rail system suffered significant damage, resulting in the temporary
shutdown of five of six routes in and out of Los Angeles. Two of those routes required extensive reconstruction. Embargos were instituted to restrict traffic to and from Southern California and the Las Vegas area until service could be restored
while a number of trains were rerouted onto other serviceable tracks.

15.
Selected Quarterly Data (Unaudited)

Selected unaudited quarterly data are
as follows:

[a]

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recognized a $154 million after-tax charge for unasserted asbestos-related claims.

Controls and Procedures

As of the
end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive
Vice President – Finance and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that
evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them, in a timely manner, to material information relating to the
Corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Corporation’s periodic SEC filings.

Additionally, the CEO and CFO determined that there have been no significant changes to the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.



MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). The Corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

The Corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2004, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Corporation’s independent auditors have issued an audit report on
our assessment of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 67.

January 31, 2005



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Union Pacific Corporation, its Directors, and Shareholders:

We have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Corporation’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the
Corporation and our report dated February 7, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule.
