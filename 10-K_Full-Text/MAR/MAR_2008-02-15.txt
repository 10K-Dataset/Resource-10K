FORM 10-K 
FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2007



Throughout this report, we refer to Marriott International, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, as
“we,” “us,” or “the Company.” Unless otherwise specified, each reference to a particular year means the fiscal year ended on the date shown in the table below, rather than the corresponding calendar year:

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

We are a worldwide operator and
franchisor of hotels and related lodging facilities. We were organized as a corporation in Delaware in 1997 and became a public company in 1998 when we were “spun off” as a separate entity by the company formerly named “Marriott
International, Inc.” Our operations are grouped into the following five business segments:

Prior to November 3, 2007, our operations also included our synthetic fuel business, which we
now classify as discontinued operations.

Our business includes our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service,
International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments. We develop, operate, and franchise hotels and corporate housing properties under 15 separate brand names, and we develop, operate, and market timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties
under four separate brand names. We also provide services to home/condominium owner associations for projects associated with several of our brands.

Financial information by industry segment and geographic area as of and for the 2007, 2006, and 2005 fiscal years then ended appears in Footnote No. 19, “Business Segments,” of the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.



Lodging

We operate or franchise 2,999 lodging properties worldwide, with 535,093 rooms as of year-end 2007 inclusive of 21 home and condominium products (1,916 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we
provided 2,156 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. We believe that our portfolio of lodging brands is the broadest of any company in the world and that we are the leader in the quality tier of the vacation
timesharing business. Consistent with our focus on management and franchising, we own very few of our lodging properties. We manage and franchise lodging properties employing the following brands:

The North American Full-Service segment and the North American Limited-Service segment include
properties located in the continental United States and Canada. The Luxury segment includes worldwide properties. The International segment includes full-service and limited-service properties located outside the continental United States and
Canada. Unless otherwise indicated, our references to Marriott Hotels & Resorts throughout this report include Marriott Conference Centers and JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, references to Renaissance Hotels & Resorts
include Renaissance ClubSport, and references to Fairfield Inn include Fairfield Inn & Suites.

In addition to the brands noted
above, in 2007 we announced our new brand of family-friendly resorts and spas, “Nickelodeon Resorts by Marriott” and a new brand of lifestyle boutique hotels, “Edition.” At year-end 2007, no properties were yet open under either
brand.

Company-Operated Lodging Properties

At year-end 2007, we operated 1,040 properties (266,751 rooms) under long-term management agreements with property owners, 31 properties (7,729 rooms) under long-term lease agreements with property owners (management and lease agreements
together, “the Operating Agreements”), and six properties (1,316 rooms) as owned. The figures noted for properties operated under long-term management agreements include 21 residential products (1,916 units) for which we manage the related
owners’ associations.

Terms of our management agreements vary, but typically we earn a management fee, which comprises a base
management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. Our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs (both direct and indirect) of
operations. Such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years, with options to renew for up to 50 or more additional years. Our lease agreements also vary, but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a
percentage of annual revenues in excess of a fixed amount. Many of the Operating Agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners. Additionally, many of our Operating Agreements permit the owners to
terminate the agreement if certain performance metrics are not met and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured such deficiencies.

For lodging facilities that we operate, we generally are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising the managers and employees required to operate
the facilities and for purchasing supplies, both for which we generally are reimbursed by the owners. We provide centralized reservation services and national advertising, marketing and promotional services, as well as various accounting and data
processing services. We are generally reimbursed by owners for the cost of providing these services.



Franchised Lodging Properties

We have franchising programs that permit the use of certain of our brand names and our lodging systems by other hotel owners and operators. Under these programs, we generally receive an initial application fee and
continuing royalty fees, which typically range from 4 percent to 6 percent of room revenues for all brands, plus 2 percent to 3 percent of food and beverage revenues for certain full-service hotels. In addition, franchisees contribute to our
national marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems. At year-end 2007, we had 1,922 franchised properties (259,297 rooms).

Timeshare and Residential

We develop,
operate, market, and sell timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties under four brand names and generate revenues from three primary sources: (1) selling fee simple and other forms of timeshare intervals and personal
residences; (2) financing consumer purchases; and (3) operating the resorts. Many resorts are located adjacent to company-operated hotels, such as Marriott Hotels & Resorts and The Ritz-Carlton, and owners have access to certain
hotel facilities during their vacation. Owners can trade their annual interval for intervals at other Marriott timesharing resorts or for intervals at certain timesharing resorts not otherwise sponsored by Marriott through a third-party exchange
company. Owners can also trade their unused interval for points in the Marriott Rewards

®

frequent stay program, enabling them to stay at over 2,900 company-operated or franchised properties
worldwide.

We sell residential real estate in conjunction with luxury hotel development (Ritz-Carlton-Residential) and Timeshare segment
projects (Ritz-Carlton Club-Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited inventory available at any one time. Residences developed in conjunction
with hotels are typically constructed and sold by hotel owners with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and
exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential products distinctive.

Seasonality

In general, business at company-operated and franchised properties is relatively stable and includes only
moderate seasonal fluctuations. Business at some resort properties may be seasonal depending on location.

Relationship with Major Customer

We operate a number of properties under long-term management agreements that are owned or leased by Host Hotels & Resorts,
Inc. (“Host”). In addition, Host is a partner in several partnerships that own properties operated by us under long-term management agreements. See Footnote No. 22, “Relationship with Major Customer,” in the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for more information.

Arizona, California, South Carolina, Florida, and Hawaii and in ski resorts in California, Colorado, and Utah. Internationally, MVC has resorts in Aruba,
France, Spain, St. Thomas (U.S. Virgin Islands), the West Indies, and Thailand.

The Ritz-Carlton Club

over the short-term within the Timeshare segment.

owners at year-end 2007, compared to approximately 343,000 at year-end 2006.

SpongeBob SquarePants, and spas for adults and kids. Projects are in various stages of development in the United States, and we expect to open the first property in San Diego in 2010. Other potential resort locations being considered for development
include major family-oriented destinations in the United States, Caribbean and Mexican resort areas, the United Kingdom and Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East.

Edition

.

In June 2007, we announced that we had joined forces with hotel innovator Ian Schrager to create next-generation lifestyle boutique hotels. Edition combines a personal, intimate,
individualized, and unique lodging experience on a global scale. These new lifestyle boutique hotels attempt to push the boundaries, break new ground, and take the hotel industry to a new level. Plans include building and operating up to 100

We operate 14 systemwide hotel reservation centers, eight in the United States and Canada and six in other countries and territories, which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide, including
franchised properties. We own one of the U.S. facilities and lease the others.

Additionally, we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy.” Our Look No Further

®

Best Rate Guarantee, which assures
customers that they won’t find cheaper rates than those available through our telephone reservation system, our Web site or any other Marriott reservation channel, our



strong Marriott Rewards loyalty program, and our information-rich and easy-to-use

www.Marriott.com

Web site all encourage customers to make
reservations using the Marriott Web site. Our reservation system manages and controls inventory availability and pricing set by our hotels, and allows us to utilize online and offline agents where cost effective. With almost 3,000 hotels economies
of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room, drive profits for our owners, and maximize our fee revenue.

Our
Architecture and Construction (“A&C”) division provides design, development, construction, refurbishment, and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate
from our management or franchise contracts. Similar to third-party contractors, A&C provides these services for owners and franchisees of Marriott-branded properties on a fee basis.

Competition

We encounter strong competition both as
a lodging operator and as a franchisor. We believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands, we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising.
There are approximately 770 lodging management companies in the United States, including several that operate more than 100 properties. These operators are primarily private management firms, but also include several large national chains that own
and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands. Our management contracts are typically long-term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met.

Affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the U.S. lodging industry. In 2007, approximately two-thirds of U.S. hotel
rooms were brand-affiliated. Most of the branded properties are franchises, under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system. The franchising business is fairly concentrated, with the six largest
franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all U.S. rooms.

Outside the United States, branding is
much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators, although branding is more common for new hotel development. We believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow, trade
barriers are reduced, international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs.

Based on lodging industry data, we have a 9 percent share of the U.S. hotel market (based on number of rooms) and we estimate less than a 1 percent share of the lodging market outside the United States. We believe
that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) than direct competitors in most
market areas. We attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference. We believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities, our marketing programs, our reservation systems and our
emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands.

Properties that we operate or franchise are
regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness. Most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds, generally a fixed percentage of revenue, for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings. These ongoing
refurbishment programs, along with periodic brand initiatives, are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties.

While service excellence is Marriott’s hallmark, we continually look for new ways to delight our guests. Currently, we are focused on elevating the
Marriott experience beyond that of a traditional hotel stay to a total guest experience that encompasses exceptional style, personal luxury, and superior service. This approach to hospitality, “The New Look and Feel of Marriott Now,” is
influenced by the world’s foremost innovations in design, technology, culinary expertise, service, and comfort. This evolution can be seen across all of our brands, in new and stylish hotel designs, luxurious bedding, exotic destinations,
world-class spas and fitness centers, and inspired cuisine. Each brand, from luxury to moderately priced, will be more upscale and attuned to customer needs than ever before.

Our At Your Service

®

program focuses on the total guest experience from point of reservation to checkout. As part of the pre-arrival planning service, guests receive a personalized email
prior to check-in that includes local transportation, weather, and restaurant information, as well as directions and maps. At a growing number of hotels and resorts, service has been expanded to include a “virtual concierge.” Guests are
able to reserve spa treatments, room service for delivery upon arrival, and other amenities specific to each property. Guests may also request complimentary amenities such as extra pillows, miniature refrigerators, and early check-in or late
checkout. We have also streamlined the travel planning and booking process with the addition of Marriott Flexrez to At Your Service. In addition to booking hotel rooms on

www.Marriott.com

, our online customers can now find competitive airfare
and car rental rates there as well.



The vacation ownership industry is one of the fastest growing segments in hospitality and is comprised of
a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies. Since entering the timeshare industry over 20 years ago, we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide. Competition in the timeshare interval,
fractional, and residential business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts, trust in the brand, the pricing of product offerings, and the availability of program benefits, such as exchange programs. We believe that our
focus on offering distinct vacation experiences, combined with our financial strength, diverse market presence, strong brands, and well-maintained properties, will enable us to remain competitive. Approximately 40 percent of our timeshare ownership
resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners.

Marriott Rewards is a frequent guest program with over
28 million members and nine participating Marriott brands. The Marriott Rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards, or airline miles with any of 29
participating airline programs. We believe that Marriott Rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels. In 2007, over 50 percent of our room nights were purchased by Marriott Rewards members. In addition,
the ability of timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into Marriott Rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brand.

Discontinued Operations

Synthetic Fuel

Our synthetic fuel operation consisted of four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities (the “Facilities”). Because tax credits under Section 45K of the IRC are not available for the production
and sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar year-end 2007, and because high oil prices during 2007 will result in the phase-out of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, on
November 3, 2007, we shut down the Facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel. Accordingly, we now report this business segment as a discontinued operation. The book value of the Facilities was zero at year-end 2007, as the
Facilities have been transferred to third parties. Under the site leases for the Facilities, we were required to restore the leased premises to substantially the condition the premises were in when the leases were originally executed. However, we
executed agreements with the lessors of the sites pursuant to which we transferred the Facilities to the lessors in exchange for the release of our obligations to restore the leased premises to their original conditions. Costs associated with
shutting down the synthetic fuel operation and transferring the Facilities to the site lessors were not material.

Employee Relations

At year-end 2007, we had approximately 151,000 employees, approximately 8,700 of which were represented by labor unions. We believe relations with our
employees are positive.

Environmental Compliance

Our compliance with laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and discharge of hazardous materials has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do
not anticipate any material impact from such compliance in the future.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Forward-Looking Statements

We make forward-looking statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this
report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings
“Business and Overview,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and other statements throughout this report preceded by, followed by or that include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“intends,” “plans,” “estimates” or similar expressions.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number
of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe from time to time in our
periodic filings with the SEC. We therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise
any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Risks and Uncertainties

We are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on the Company and its financial condition. You should understand that these risks could
cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained in this report and in other Company communications. Because there is no way to determine in advance whether, or to what extent, any present uncertainty
will ultimately impact our business, you should give equal weight to each of the following:

Lodging Industry Risks

The lodging industry is highly competitive, which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel and timeshare properties for
customers.

We generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors. Each of our hotel and timeshare brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets. Our
ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others. If we are unable to
compete successfully in these areas, this could limit our operating margins, diminish our market share, and reduce our earnings.

We are
subject to the range of operating risks common to the hotel, timeshare, and corporate apartment industries.

The profitability of the hotels, vacation timeshare resorts, and corporate apartments that we operate or franchise may be adversely
affected by a number of factors, including:

(1)

the availability of and demand for hotel rooms, timeshare interval, fractional ownership and residential products, and apartments;

(2)

international, national, and regional economic and geopolitical conditions;

(3)

the impact of war, actual or threatened terrorist activity and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to war, terrorist activity or threats;

(4)

the desirability of particular locations and changes in travel patterns;

(5)

travelers’ fears of exposure to contagious diseases, such as Avian Flu and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (“SARS”);

(6)

the occurrence of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes;

(7)

taxes and government regulations that influence or determine wages, prices, interest rates, construction procedures, and costs;

(8)

the availability and cost of capital to allow us and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners to fund investments;

(9)

regional and national development of competing properties;

(10)

increases in wages and other labor costs, energy, healthcare, insurance, transportation and fuel, and other expenses central to the conduct of our business, including recent
increases in energy costs; and

(11)

organized labor activities, which could cause the diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations, loss of group business, and/or increased labor costs.



Any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand or the prices we are able to obtain for
hotel rooms, timeshare units, residential units, and corporate apartments or could increase our costs and therefore reduce the profit of our lodging businesses. Reduced demand for hotels could also give rise to losses under loans, guarantees, and
minority equity investments that we have made in connection with hotels that we manage. Even where such factors do not reduce demand, our profit margins may suffer if we are unable to fully recover increased operating costs from our customers.

The uncertain environment in the lodging industry will continue to impact our financial results and growth.

Both the Company and
the lodging industry were hurt by several events occurring over the last several years, including the global economic downturn, the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington in September 2001, the global outbreak of SARS in 2003, and military
action in Iraq. Although by 2007 both the lodging and travel industries had recovered from the depressed levels during those years, recent concerns over the possibility of an economic slowdown have left it unclear whether the recent growth
environment will continue. Accordingly, our financial results and growth could be harmed if the industry recovery stalls or is reversed.

Operational Risks

Our new branded hotel products may not be
successful.

We recently announced two new branded hotel products, Nickelodeon Resorts by Marriott

®

and Edition, and may launch additional branded hotel products in the future. We cannot
assure that these brands will be accepted by hotel owners, potential franchisees, or the traveling public, that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing the brands, or that the brands will be successful. In addition, each of these new
brands involves cooperation and/or consultation with a third party, including some shared control over product design and development, sales and marketing and brand standards. Disagreements between us and these third parties regarding areas of
consultation or shared control could slow the development of these new brands and/or impair Marriott’s ability to take actions it believes to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands.

Our lodging operations are subject to international, national, and regional conditions.

Because we conduct our business on a national and
international platform, our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of regional and global economies. In recent years, our business was hurt by decreases in travel resulting from recent economic conditions, the military action in
Iraq, and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism. Our future economic performance is similarly subject to the uncertain economic environment in the United States and other regions, the
resulting unknown pace of business travel, and the occurrence of any future incidents in the countries where we operate.

Risks relating
to natural disasters, contagious disease, terrorist activity, and war could reduce the demand for lodging, which may adversely affect our revenues.

So called “Acts of God,” such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters,
and the spread of contagious diseases, such as Avian Flu and SARS, in locations where we own, manage or franchise significant properties, and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers can cause a decline in the level of
business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging. Actual or threatened war, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, and other geopolitical uncertainty can have a similar effect. Any one or more of these events may reduce the
overall demand for hotel rooms, timeshare units, and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we are able to obtain for them, both of which could adversely affect our profits.

We may have disputes with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise.

Consistent with our focus on management and franchising, we own
very few of our lodging properties. The nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to
interpretation and may give rise to disagreements in some instances. We seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but have not always been
able to do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements has in the past resulted in litigation, and could do so in the future.

Damage to
or other potential losses involving properties that we own, manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance.

We have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are
customary. Market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of insurance coverage that we can obtain and our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as
earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, or terrorist acts, may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. As a result, we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels. In
addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in certain losses being
totally uninsured. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for guarantees, debt, or other financial obligations
related to the property.



Development and Financing Risks

Our growth strategy depends upon third-party owners/operators, and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable.

Our present
growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners. The terms of our management agreements, franchise agreements, and leases for each of our lodging
facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors, among other things. We cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations, renew agreements, or
enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today.

Our ability to grow our
management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments.

Our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing
facilities to managed or franchised Marriott brands is affected, and may potentially be limited, by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally. These include site availability, financing, planning, zoning and other local
approvals, and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors, such as projected room occupancy, changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply, territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements,
costs of construction, and anticipated room rate structure.

We depend on capital to buy and maintain hotels, and hotel owners or we may
be unable to access capital when necessary.

In order to fund new hotel investments, as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels, both the Company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money. The availability of
funds for new investments and maintenance of existing hotels depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control. Our ability to recover loan and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from
owners through the proceeds of hotel sales, refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital. In addition, downgrades of our public debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor
Service or similar companies could increase our cost of capital.

Further volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our
ability to sell the loans that our Timeshare business generates.

Our Timeshare business provides financing to purchasers of our timeshare and fractional properties, and we periodically sell interests in those loans in the securities markets.
While we do not believe that recent volatility in the credit markets will prevent us from continuing to sell those notes on attractive terms

,

further volatility could cause future sale terms to be materially less favorable to us or prevent us
from selling our timeshare notes entirely, which in turn would reduce future gains and could result in increased borrowings to provide capital to replace anticipated proceeds from such sales.

Our development activities expose us to project cost, completion, and resale risks.

We develop new hotel, timeshare interval, fractional
ownership, and residential properties, both directly and through partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures with third parties. Our involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks, including that:
(1) construction delays, cost overruns, or so called “Acts of God” such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations; (2) we may be unable to recover
development costs we incur for projects that are not pursued to completion; (3) conditions within capital markets may limit our ability, or that of third parties with whom we do business, to raise capital for completion of projects that have
commenced or development of future properties; and (4) properties that we develop could become less attractive due to changes in mortgage rates, market absorption or oversupply, with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties
for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate.

Development activities that involve our co-investment with third parties
may result in disputes that could increase project costs, impair project operations, or increase project completion risks.

Partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures involving our co-investment with third parties generally
include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks, including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their
obligations, or could have or develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. Although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships, joint ventures or similar structures, actions by
another investor may present additional risks of project delay, increased project costs, or operational difficulties following project completion.

Risks associated with development and sale of residential properties that are associated with our lodging and timeshare properties or brands may reduce our profits.

In certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate, through
minority interests and/or licensing fees, in the development and sale of residential properties associated with



our brands, including luxury residences, and condominiums under our Ritz-Carlton and Marriott brands. Such projects pose additional risks beyond those
generally associated with our lodging and timeshare businesses, which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity, including the following:

•

Decreases in residential real estate and vacation home prices or demand generally, which have historically been cyclical, could reduce our profits or even result in
losses on residential sales, result in significant carrying costs if the pace of sales is slower than we anticipate, or make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands;

•

Increases in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability, or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying
residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay; and

•

Residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims, and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant.

Technology, Information Protection, and Privacy Risks

A failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.

The lodging and timeshare industries continue to demand the use of sophisticated technology and
systems, including those used for our reservation, revenue management and property management systems, our Marriott Rewards program, and technologies we make available to our guests. These technologies and systems must be refined, updated, and/or
replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis. If we are unable to do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new
technology or system, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.

An increase in the use of third-party Internet reservation services could adversely impact our
revenues

. Some of our hotel rooms are booked through Internet travel intermediaries, such as Expedia.com

®

, Travelocity.com

®

, and Priceline.com

®

,

serving both the leisure and, increasingly, the corporate travel and group meeting sectors. While Marriott’s Look No
Further

®

Best Rate Guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of these Internet travel intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels, these intermediaries continue
their attempts to commoditize hotel rooms by aggressively marketing to price-sensitive travelers and corporate accounts and increasing the importance of general indicators of quality (such as “three-star downtown hotel”) at the expense of
brand identification. These agencies hope that consumers will eventually develop brand loyalties to their travel services rather than to our lodging brands. Although we expect to continue to maintain and even increase the strength of our brands in
the online marketplace, if the amount of sales made through Internet intermediaries increases significantly, our business and profitability may be harmed.

Failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions, damage of reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.

Our businesses require collection
and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers as they are entered into, processed by, summarized by, and reported by our various information
systems. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. If that data is not accurate or complete we could make faulty decisions.
Our customers also have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and other international
jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines and litigation.

Changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.

Our Timeshare segment, and to a lesser extent our
other lodging segments, rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email marketing, and postal mailings. Any further restrictions in laws such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, CANSPAM Act, and various U.S. state laws,
or new federal laws, regarding marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing, email, and postal mailing techniques and could force
further changes in our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of timeshare units and other products. We also obtain access to
potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing
materials. If the acquisition of these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired.



Other Risks

If we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer.

We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we are not able to recruit,
train, develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency or internal control failures. Insufficient numbers of talented associates
could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses.

Delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain, and our
board of directors could implement, anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts.

Under the Delaware business combination statute, a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us
without board of director’s consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock. Our governing corporate documents also, among other things, require supermajority votes in connection
with mergers and similar transactions. In addition, our Board of Directors could, without stockholder approval, implement other anti-takeover defenses, such as a stockholder rights plan to replace the existing stockholder’s rights plan that
will expire in March 2008 and which we do not presently plan to renew.

Item 2.

Properties.

Company-operated properties are
described in Part I, Item 1, “Business,” earlier in this report. We believe our properties are in generally good physical condition with the need for only routine repairs and maintenance and periodic capital improvements. Most of our
regional offices and reservation centers, both domestically and internationally, are located in leased facilities. We also lease space in six office buildings with combined space of approximately 1.3 million square feet in Maryland and Florida
where our corporate, Ritz-Carlton, and Marriott Vacation Club International headquarters are located.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

From time to time, we
are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including adjustments proposed during governmental examinations of the various tax returns we file. We currently are not aware of any legal proceedings or claims
that we believe will have, individually or in aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW

We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,999 properties (535,093 rooms)
and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2007 and include 21 home and condominium projects (1,916 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,156 furnished
corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals.

Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North
American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under 19 separate brand names in 68 countries and territories.

We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the
following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; and (3) financing customer purchases of
timesharing intervals. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate.

We sell residential real estate in conjunction with luxury hotel development (Ritz-Carlton-Residential) and Timeshare segment projects (Ritz-Carlton
Club-Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited inventory available at any one time. Residences developed in conjunction with hotels are typically
constructed and sold by hotel owners with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our
brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential products distinctive.

Generally, lodging demand
remained strong through 2007, driven by continued strength associated with worldwide business travel. In general, luxury, international, and full-service properties experienced stronger demand than limited-service properties. Strong demand enabled
us to increase rates at the property level, which resulted in solid year-over-year RevPAR increases. Revenue mix improvement is a function of the strong demand environment and results as some less profitable business is limited in favor of more
profitable business, such as fewer discounted leisure packages in favor of more corporate business. This strategy of shifting business to higher rated tiers, yielded strong year-over-year average daily rate growth and only modest occupancy declines.
In addition, group rates continue to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is replaced with business negotiated at higher rates.

Demand for our brands is strong in many markets around the world. For our North American comparable properties, RevPAR increases in 2007, as compared to the year-ago period, were particularly strong in Dallas, New
York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Internationally, 2007 RevPAR increases as compared to the prior year were particularly strong in Central and South East Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.

Our approach to improving property-level and above-property productivity has benefited our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees.
Driving room rate improvement, benchmarking successful performance, and leveraging our size have all contributed to property-level margin improvements and higher incentive management fees to us. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary
Web site,

www.Marriott.com

, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel.

Our brands are strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality
of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information-rich and easy-to-use Web site, a multi-channel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands
by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings.

In 2007, we announced our agreement with the Nickelodeon division of Viacom, Inc. and Miller Global Properties, LLC to co-develop a new lodging resort brand and concept for travelers seeking fun and adventure, “Nickelodeon Resorts by
Marriott.” Also during 2007, we announced our agreement with Ian Schrager to create a global boutique lifestyle hotel brand “Edition” on a large scale.

See Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” of this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces.



CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2007, 2006, and 2005.

Continuing
Operations

Revenues

2007 Compared to 2006

Revenues increased by $995 million (8 percent) to $12,990 million in 2007 from $11,995 million in 2006, as a result of stronger demand for
hotel rooms worldwide, which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $116 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth, as we opened 203 properties (29,200
rooms) throughout 2007. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by
$88 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were
calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees for 2007 included $6 million of
business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove
property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases.

Timeshare sales and services
revenue increased by $170 million (11 percent) in 2007 over the prior year. The increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition thresholds. In 2006, some projects were
in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007. The increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue.

Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue increased by $121 million (11 percent). The increase largely reflected stronger RevPAR and the mix of
owned and leased properties in 2007, as compared to 2006, and to a lesser extent, higher fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate, offset by the recognition of $19 million of hotel management
and franchise agreement termination fees in 2007, as compared to the recognition of $26 million of such fees in 2006.

The $995 million
increase in total revenue includes $500 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,575 million in 2007 from $8,075 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised
properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense have no impact on either
our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to wage increases, sales growth, and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added 15 managed properties (4,870 rooms) and 138 franchised
properties (15,963 rooms) to our system in 2007, net of properties exiting the system.

2006 Compared to 2005

Revenues increased by $866 million (8 percent) to $11,995 million in 2006 from $11,129 million in 2005, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms
worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $117 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not
earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees increased by $80 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees include $10
million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits
also drove property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of our purchase, early in the second half of 2005, of 13
formerly managed properties from CTF Holdings Ltd. (“CTF”). See Footnote No. 8, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” later in this report for a detailed description of the CTF transaction. As planned, eight of the CTF properties
were sold during 2006: one property was sold in the first quarter; five properties were sold in the second quarter; and two properties were sold in the third quarter.



Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $90 million (6 percent) over the prior year. The
increase largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed later in the “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle” narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not
reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Additionally, financing and services revenue increased in 2006 versus the prior year, as did villa rental revenue. Partially offsetting these increases, development revenue
declined due to projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and limited available inventory associated with projects that sold out or were nearing sell-out.

The $866 million increase in total revenue includes $404 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,075 million in 2006 from $7,671 million
in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and to wage increases. We added 13 managed properties (4,126 rooms) and 77 franchised properties (11,286 rooms) to our
system in 2006, net of properties exiting the system.

Operating Income

2007 Compared to 2006

Operating income increased by $101 million (9 percent) to $1,188 million in
2007 from $1,087 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income reflects stronger combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees of $204 million, partially offset by higher general, administrative, and other expenses
of $91 million, lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $7 million, and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $5 million.

The combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees increase of $204 million reflected strong RevPAR growth, unit growth, and
property-level margin improvements and favorable exchange rates worldwide. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees
in 2007. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore,
incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance
proceeds received in 2006.

As compared to the year-ago period, general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $91 million (13
percent) from $677 million in 2006 to $768 million in 2007. In 2007, we incurred a $35 million charge related to excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Labor examination of
our employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) feature of our Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the “Plan”). See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the
ESOP settlement. Additionally, the increase was attributable to, among other things, increased costs related to our unit growth, development and systems improvements, increased litigation expenses, and increased other administrative costs. Also
unfavorably impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, when compared to the prior year, were foreign exchange losses totaling $2 million in 2007 as compared to foreign exchange gains of $6 million in 2006 and $1 million of guarantee
charges in 2007 while the year-ago period reflected $6 million of guarantee reversals. Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases were $4 million of lower hotel operating agreement performance cure payments in 2007 as compared to 2006 and a
$9 million reversal in 2007 of reserves that were no longer required. Increased legal expenses in 2007 include charges associated with litigation and other legal matters. Of the $91 million increase in total general, administrative, and other
expenses, an increase of $13 million was attributable to our Lodging segments and a $78 million increase was unallocated.

Timeshare sales
and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased
financing revenue net of financing expenses, more than offset by the reversal in 2006 of $15 million reversal of contingency reserves and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs
and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007, offset by several other projects that were approaching sell-out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects
increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, as compared to 2006.

The $5 million decrease in owned, leased,
corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected $19 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, as compared to $26 million in 2006. Depreciation charges totaling $8 million were
recorded in 2007 associated with one owned



property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” during 2007 as compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2006
of $7 million associated with two properties that were reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used.” Partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct
expenses was the favorable impact of $4 million associated with both the stronger demand environment in 2007 and the impact of the sale and purchase of several properties.

2006 Compared to 2005

Operating income increased by $388 million (56 percent) to $1,087 million in
2006 from $699 million in the prior year. The increase in 2006 is, in part, due to a combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fee increase of $197 million, reflecting stronger RevPAR growth, unit growth, and property-level
margin improvements. Stronger owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses contributed $17 million of the improvement in operating income and reflected the strong demand environment in 2006 and the impact of the CTF
hotel properties acquired in 2005. The $17 million improvement in 2006 versus the prior year reflects increased owned and leased results of $20 million, a $12 million increase in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received and
$5 million of higher other income, partially offset by $20 million of lower land lease income. Also reflected in the year-over-year change in owned and leased results are depreciation charges totaling $7 million recorded in 2006 associated with two
properties that were reclassified in 2006 from “held for sale” to “held and used.” The depreciation charges totaling $7 million represented the amount that would have been recognized had the two properties been continuously
classified as “held and used.”

Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses increased by $98 million (38 percent)
in 2006 and largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As noted earlier in the “Revenue” discussion, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a
component of gains and other income. Also reflected in the $98 million favorable variance, development revenue net of expenses increased by $14 million and financing, services and other revenue net of expenses increased by $7 million. Increased
development revenue net of expenses primarily reflects lower development expenses associated with projects in 2006 in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with
Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions” (“SOP 04-2”), implemented in 2006. Increased financing, services and other revenue net of expenses reflects a $15 million reversal of marketing
related contingency reserves in 2006.

As compared to the year-ago period, general, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $76
million (10 percent) to $677 million in 2006 from $753 million in 2005. In 2005, we incurred general, administrative, and other expenses of $94 million primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with
the termination of management agreements resulting from the CTF transaction. We also incurred general, administrative, and other expenses of $30 million in 2005 associated with our bedding incentive program. We implemented the bedding incentive
program in the 2005 second quarter to help ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by year-end 2005. Further impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, 2005 reflected hotel operating agreement performance
cure payments of $15 million versus a $6 million similar payment in 2006, and 2005 also reflected $9 million of guarantee charges associated with three properties versus the reversal of an additional $5 million of guarantee charges in 2006.
Additionally, impacting the year-over-year general, administrative, and other expenses variance were foreign exchange gains totaling $6 million in 2006 as compared to losses of $5 million in 2005. Also impacting the year-over-year change in general,
administrative, and other expenses, an additional $22 million reflects unit growth, systems improvements, higher program and joint venture development expenses, and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Development
expenses and deferred compensation expenses were higher in 2006 by $15 million and $5 million, respectively. As noted under the heading “New Accounting Standards” in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” section of our 2006 Form 10-K, we adopted a new accounting standard in 2006 associated with share-based compensation. This new standard resulted in incremental general, administrative, and other expenses of
$39 million versus 2005, primarily impacting the unallocated portion of our general, administrative, and other expenses. Of the $76 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $124 million was attributable to
our Lodging segments and a $48 million increase was unallocated.



Gains and Other Income (Expense)

The table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005:

2007 Compared to 2006

The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt for 2007 was associated with government incentives. The loans were forgiven in recognition of our contribution to job growth and economic development. Gain on sale/income on
redemption of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Gain on sale/income on
redemption of joint venture and other investments of $68 million in 2006 comprised $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture investments and the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee which generated a gain of
$25 million.

2006 Compared to 2005

Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $68 million in 2006 represents $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture and other investments and $25 million of income associated with
the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee. As further explained in the earlier “Revenues” discussion for 2006, Timeshare segment note sale gains of $77 million in 2006 are presented in the “Timeshare sales and
services” revenue caption.

Interest Expense

2007 Compared to 2006

Interest expense increased by $60 million (48 percent) to $184 million for 2007 from $124 million in
2006. Of the $60 million increase over 2006, $78 million was due to: $26 million of higher interest reflecting a higher outstanding commercial paper balance, primarily due to increased share repurchases and the ESOP settlement payments, and related
interest rates; $25 million of interest associated with our Series H Senior Notes issuance which occurred late in 2006 and our Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances which occurred in 2007; a charge of $13 million in 2007 related to the ESOP
settlement; charges totaling $53 million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf including
Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self-insurance programs; interest totaling $5 million associated with other additional debt; and the write off of $2 million of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit
agreement in 2007. See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. The increase in interest on the programs we operate on behalf of the owners over the year-ago period is attributable to higher
liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting the $78 million interest expense increases over 2006 was an $18 million favorable variance to last year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects.

2006 Compared to 2005

Interest
expense increased by $18 million (17 percent) to $124 million in 2006 from $106 million in 2005. Included within interest expense for 2006 and 2005 are charges totaling $46 million and $29 million, respectively, relating to interest on accumulated
cash inflows, in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf. The increase in interest on these programs over 2005 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Interest expense
also increased in 2006, due to our June 2005 Series F Notes issuance, our June 2006 Series H Notes issuance, and higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates. Partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines
associated with the payoff, at maturity, of both our Series D Notes in April 2005 and Series B Notes in November 2005, and the exchange of our Series C and Series E Notes for lower interest rate Series G Notes in 2005.



Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax

2007 Compared to 2006

Interest income, before the
provision for loan losses, decreased by $11 million (22 percent) to $38 million in 2007 from $49 million in 2006, primarily reflecting lower interest income associated with loans that have been repaid to us, partially offset by the impact associated
with new loan fundings.

Loan loss provisions increased by $20 million versus the prior year primarily reflecting a $12 million charge
associated with one property and a $5 million charge to write off our remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines, Inc. (“Delta”) lease versus loan loss reversals of $3 million in 2006. For additional information
regarding the Delta lease investment write-off, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption later in this report.

Our tax
provision increased by $61 million (16 percent) from a tax provision of $380 million in 2006 to a tax provision of $441 million in 2007 and reflected higher pretax income from our Lodging segments as well as a higher tax rate in 2007, primarily
reflecting both increased taxes associated with our international operations and a less favorable mix of taxable earnings between countries. Increased taxes also reflect a charge for a German legislative tax change in 2007, which had a one-time
impact and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement.

2006 Compared to 2005

Interest income, before the
provision for loan losses, decreased by $30 million (38 percent) to $49 million in 2006 from $79 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us in 2005. Loan loss provisions decreased by $31 million versus the prior year
reflecting the reversal of loan loss provisions totaling $3 million in 2006 compared to a charge of $17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our Delta lease, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption later in this report for
additional information and an $11 million loan loss provision in 2005 associated with one property.

Our tax provision totaled $380 million
in 2006 compared to a tax provision of $284 million in 2005. The difference of $96 million is attributable to higher taxes in 2006 associated with higher pretax income from our lodging operations.

Equity in Earnings

2007 Compared to 2006

Equity in earnings increased by $12 million from $3 million in 2006 to $15 million in 2007 and reflected the mix of investments, compared to 2006, and
stronger results at several joint ventures reflecting the strong lodging demand environment in 2007, for one joint venture, the reopening of a hotel, late in 2006, in Mexico, which had been closed following a hurricane in 2005 and strong demand in
2007 for our timeshare products in Hawaii.

2006 Compared to 2005

The $33 million decline from earnings of $36 million in 2005 to earnings of $3 million in 2006, attributable to our equity investments, reflected the recognition in 2005 of $30 million of equity earnings from the sale
of hotels by three equity joint ventures in which we had equity interests. In addition, since 2005 we have sold several equity joint ventures.

Income
from Continuing Operations

2007 Compared to 2006

Compared to 2006, income from continuing operations decreased by $15 million (2 percent) to $697 million in 2007, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by $0.10 (6 percent) to $1.75. As
discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the decrease versus the prior year is due to higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($91 million), higher taxes ($61 million), higher
interest expense ($60 million), higher loan loss provision ($20 million), lower interest income ($11 million), lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($7 million), and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other
revenue net of direct expenses ($5 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were higher fee income ($204 million), higher gains and other income ($23 million), higher equity investment results ($12 million), and a higher minority
interest benefit ($1 million).



2006 Compared to 2005

Compared to 2005, income from continuing operations increased by $169 million (31 percent) to $712 million in 2006, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by $0.48 (41 percent) to $1.65.
As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the increase versus the prior year is due to higher fee income ($197 million), higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($98
million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($76 million), a lower loan loss provision ($31 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($17 million), and lower minority interest
expense ($2 million). Partially offsetting these favorable variances, were significantly higher taxes ($96 million), lower gains and other income ($75 million), lower equity investment results ($33 million), lower interest income ($30 million), and
higher interest expense ($18 million).

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle


Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate
Time-Sharing Transactions”

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Financial
Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 152, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67,” and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04-2.
Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” and FAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” to exclude accounting for real estate
time-sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted SOP 04-2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter.

Under SOP 04-2, we charge
the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the
time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which requires us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs.

The adoption of SOP 04-2 in 2006, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated
Statements of Income, resulted in a non-cash after-tax charge of $109 million ($0.25 per diluted share). The pretax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write-down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable
reserve and an increase in current liabilities of $18 million.

We estimate that, for the 20-year period from 2008 through 2027, the
cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $1.7 billion.

Business
Segments

We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments:

•

North American Full-Service Lodging

, which includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts,
Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport properties located in the continental United States and Canada;

•

North American Limited-Service Lodging

, which includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay
properties located in the continental United States and Canada;

•

International Lodging

, which includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts,
Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Ramada International, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada;

•

Luxury Lodging

, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts properties worldwide; and

•

Timeshare

, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide under
Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club.

In
addition to the segments above, in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations.



In addition to the brands noted above, in 2007 we announced our new brand of family-friendly resorts and
spas, “Nickelodeon Resorts by Marriott” and a new brand of lifestyle boutique hotels, “Edition.” At year-end 2007, no properties were yet open under either brand.

In 2006, we analyzed our internal reporting process and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency and, as part
of this process, we evaluated the impact on segment reporting. Accordingly, we now report five operating segments, and no longer allocate indirect administrative expenses to our segments. We reflect this revised segment reporting throughout this
report for all periods presented, and present historical figures in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting. See also the Form 8-K that we filed on March 19, 2007, furnishing quarterly Revenues and Income from Continuing
Operations for each of 2006 and 2005 in the new segment format.

We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results
of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, indirect general, administrative, and other expenses, or income taxes. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments. Because
note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results. We include interest income associated with Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales are an
integral part of that segment’s operations. We also allocate other gains or losses as well as equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative, and other expenses to each of our segments. “Other
unallocated corporate” represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments.

We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments
considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment, and our organizational and management reporting structure.



Total Lodging Products by Segment

At year-end 2007, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,156 corporate housing rental units):

(1)

North American includes properties located in the continental United States and
Canada. International includes properties located outside the continental United States and Canada.

(2)

Represents projects where we manage the related owners’ association.
Residential products are included once they possess a certificate of occupancy.

(3)

Includes resorts that are in active sales as well as those that are sold out.
Products in active sales may not be ready for occupancy.



Revenues

Our business includes our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service,
International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments. We consider total segment revenues and total segment financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the
revenues and results of our operations to those of other lodging companies.

We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our
performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. RevPAR may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues.

Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross
operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. This ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have
the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales
and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.



2007 Compared to 2006

We added 203 properties (29,200 rooms) and 55 properties (9,722 rooms) exited the system in 2007, not including residential products. We also added three residential properties (347 units).

Total segment financial results increased by $173 million (12 percent) to $1,588 million in 2007 from $1,415 million in 2006, and total segment revenues
increased by $979 million to $12,909 million in 2007, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,930 million in 2006. The results, as compared to the prior year, reflect a $204 million (17 percent) increase in combined base management, franchise,
and incentive management fees from $1,224 million in 2006 to $1,428 million in 2007, a $16 million increase in earnings associated with equity investments, and a $1 million minority interest benefit. Partially offsetting these favorable variances
was a decrease of $18 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $13 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $10 million in gains and other income, and a decrease of
$7 million in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses.

Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both
domestic and international rate increases, higher property-level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth, drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were
calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million (31 percent) during 2007, reflecting the impact of strong room rate increases and
property-level margin improvements associated with productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned
and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years and base management fees
included $6 million and $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years, received in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, 67 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to
us versus 62 percent in 2006.

Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and
managed properties, for comparable North American properties increased by 6.0 percent over 2006, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased by 6.2 percent over 2006.

Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 8.4 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties
increased by 8.9 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased by 6.5 percent (7.6 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased by 7.0 percent.

As compared to 2006, 2007 worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased by 150 basis points, while North American company-operated
house profit margins improved by 160 basis points versus 2006. For 2007, as compared to 2006, house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) at our full-service managed properties in North America increased by 10.6 percent. HP-PAR at our North
American limited-service managed properties increased by 8.9 percent, and worldwide HP-PAR for all our brands increased by 11.0 percent on a constant dollar basis.

2006 Compared to 2005

We added 136 properties (23,466 rooms) and 45 properties (8,616 rooms) left the system in 2006. Most
of the properties that left the system were limited-service properties.

Total segment financial results increased by $314 million (29
percent) to $1,415 million in 2006 from $1,101 million in 2005, and total segment revenues increased by $857 million to $11,930 million in 2006, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,073 million in 2005. The results as compared to the prior
year reflect a $197 million (19 percent) increase in combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fees from $1,027 million in 2005 to $1,224 million in 2006, $124 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, $8
million of increased owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $98 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, and an increase in minority interest of $2 million, partially
offset by $78 million of lower gains and other income and a $37 million decline in earnings associated with equity investments. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property-level
food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned
and due until 2006. Incentive management fees increased by $80 million (40 percent) during 2006, reflecting the impact of strong room rate improvement and property-level margin improvements. Incentive management fees include $10 million and $14
million for 2006 and 2005,



respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. In 2006, 62
percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 51 percent in 2005.

Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North
American properties increased by 9.1 percent over 2005 and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased by 8.9 percent.

Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties, increased by 10.5 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased by 11.1 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable
systemwide properties increased by 9.4 percent while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased by 9.5 percent.

In addition, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased by 230 basis points, while North American company-operated house profit margins improved by 240 basis points versus 2005. For 2006, as compared to 2005,
HP-PAR at our full-service managed properties in North America increased by 16.3 percent. HP-PAR at our North American limited-service managed properties increased by 12.6 percent, and worldwide HP-PAR for all our brands increased by 15.4 percent on
a constant dollar basis.

Lodging Development

We opened 203 properties, totaling 29,200 rooms, across our brands in 2007 and 55 properties (9,722 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. We also added three residential properties (347 units). Highlights of the year
included:

•

Converting 26 properties (5,618 rooms), or 18 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 21 percent of the rooms were located in
international markets;

•

Opening approximately 16 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States;

•

Adding 156 properties (17,517 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands; and

•

Opening two new Marriott Vacation Club properties in the West Indies on the island of St. Kitts, and the U.S. Virgin Islands on the island of St. Thomas, as well as
one new Ritz-Carlton Club and residences property in San Francisco, California.

We currently have more than 125,000
hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add over 30,000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2008. We expect to remove approximately 5,000 rooms
from our system during the 2008 full year.

We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well
as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to sell properties that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of
which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of
our control. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report.

Statistics

. The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North
American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz-Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company-operated Fairfield Inn
properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful (identified as “nm” in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics
include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties.

The occupancy, average daily rate,
and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2007 include the period from December 30, 2006, through December 28, 2007, the statistics for 2006 include the period from December 31, 2005, through December 29, 2006, and
the statistics for 2005 include the period from January 1, 2005, through December 30, 2005 (except in each case, for The Ritz-Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental United States and Canada, which for
them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year).

2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 13 properties (3,947 rooms) and six properties (2,853 rooms) left the system.

In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties increased by 6.8 percent to $126.92. Occupancy for these
properties increased by 0.9 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $174.54.

The $23
million increase in segment results compared to 2006 reflects a $65 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, partially offset by a $22 million decline in gains and other income and a $20 million decrease in
owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses.

The $65 million increase in fees was largely due to stronger RevPAR and
property-level margins, driven primarily by rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $12 million and base management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $2 million, both of which were
for business interruption insurance proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina, and no similar fees in 2006. Additionally, 2006 reflected the recognition of $3 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’
results, but not earned and due until 2006, compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2007.

Gains and other income was $22 million
lower in 2007, as compared to 2006, and reflected a $37 million charge in 2006 associated with a straight-line rent receivable, partially offset by the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in
2006 and $34 million of lower other gains in 2007, as compared to 2006. The $34 million decrease in other gains compared to the prior year reflects gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate, while 2007
reflects limited similar activity. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by $20 million and reflected properties sold and $10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2006, compared
to $3 million of such fees received in 2007. General, administrative, and other expenses for 2007 were unchanged as compared to 2006 primarily reflecting $5 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments in 2006 offset by a
guarantee charge in 2007 associated with one property and the write-off of a deferred contract acquisition cost associated with another property that left the system.

2006 Compared to 2005

In 2006, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 15
properties (4,971 rooms) and six properties (1,604 rooms) left the system.

In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American
full-service properties increased by 8.5 percent to $121.10. Occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.4 percentage points, and average daily rates increased by 9.0 percent to $167.27.

Compared to the prior year, our 2006 results reflect a $59 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees. The increase in
fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven primarily by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, higher food and beverage, meeting room rental and other revenue, and productivity improvements, all of which favorably impacted property-level house
profit margins. The growth in the number of rooms, year-over-year, also contributed to the increase in fees. Incentive management fees included $10 million for 2005 that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings but not earned and due
until they were recognized. Similarly, base management fees for 2006 included $4 million of fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses
decreased by $8 million primarily as a result of properties sold in 2006 and the receipt in 2005 of a $10 million hotel agreement termination fee associated with one property, partially offset by the receipt in 2006 of $10 million of hotel
management and franchise agreement termination fees.



General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $69 million as a result of, among other things,
a $60 million charge in 2005 associated with the CTF transaction, more fully discussed in the previous “Operating Income” discussion, as well as expenses of $14 million in 2005 related to our bedding incentive program, partially offset by
increased expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development, systems improvements, and increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. In 2005, general, administrative, and other expenses included $3 million of hotel
management agreement performance cure payments associated with one property. In 2006, general, administrative, and other expenses included a $5 million hotel management agreement performance cure payment.

Gains and other income was $3 million higher than the prior year and reflected the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated
income of $25 million in 2006 and $15 million of higher net gains and other income in 2006 reflecting gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate that were partially offset by lower gains in 2006 associated
with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties. Gains and other income for 2006 reflected a $37 million non-cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value associated with land we
own and lease, as further described in the “Expected Land Sale” caption in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our 2006 Form 10-K. Equity results decreased
by $19 million versus the prior year and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $16 million in equity earnings from two joint ventures as a result of the ventures’ sale of hotels and our sale of some joint venture investments in 2005 and 2006,
offset to some extent by improved equity joint venture results reflecting the stronger demand environment.

2007 Compared to 2006

Across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 156 properties (17,517 rooms) and 16 properties (1,853 rooms) left the system in 2007. The properties that left the system were primarily associated
with our Fairfield Inn brand.

In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties increased by 4.8
percent to $89.18. Occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $122.63.

The $81 million increase in segment results, as compared to 2006, primarily reflects an $83 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, a $5 million increase in owned, leased, and
other revenue net of direct expenses, a $2 million increase in gains and other income, and a $2 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $11 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses.

In 2007, we recognized $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior years’ results but not earned and due until 2007
as compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2006. The additional increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which increased base management and franchise fees, and to productivity improvements, which
increased property-level margins and incentive management fees. Additionally, growth in the number of rooms contributed to the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct
expenses is primarily a result of hotel franchise agreement termination fees of $6 million received in 2007, which were associated with properties, primarily our Fairfield Inn brand, that left our system and $1 million of similar fees in 2006. The
$11 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2007 primarily reflects the impact of unit growth and development and the write-off of $3 million of deferred contract acquisition costs.

2006 Compared to 2005

Across our North American
Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 91 properties (11,329 rooms) and 28 properties (3,647 rooms) left the system in 2006. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand.



In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties increased by
9.1 percent to $84.41. Occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.8 percentage points to 73.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 10.4 percent to $115.24.

The $77 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $77 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, $27 million of lower general, administrative, and other
expenses, and $6 million of increased equity results, partially offset by a $14 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses and a $19 million decrease in gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely due to
higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property-level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to 2006 productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. Stronger performance at our renovated Courtyard properties, versus
nonrenovated properties, also contributed to the increase in segment results over the prior year. The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflects lower lease revenue as a result of our sale, late in 2005, of a
portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard hotels, partially offset by improved owned and leased results in 2006 reflecting stronger demand.

The decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses of $27 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $11 million associated with our bedding incentive program, a $6 million litigation charge and a $3
million guarantee charge. Improved equity results in 2006 versus 2005 reflect the impact of a stronger demand environment in 2006, new joint ventures and the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the Courtyard Joint Venture through the first
quarter of 2005 versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter. For additional information regarding the Courtyard Joint Venture, see the “Courtyard Joint Venture” caption in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 2005 Form 10-K. Gains and other income decreased by $19 million in 2006 as a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land that generated
gains and other income of $17 million, a $10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment, before maturity, to us of the loan we made to the Courtyard Joint Venture, partially offset by higher other real estate and other gains of $4 million in
2006 and increased income of $4 million in 2006 associated with cost method joint ventures.

2007 Compared to 2006

Across our International Lodging segment, we added 20 properties (4,686 rooms) and 31 properties (4,678 rooms) left the system in 2007.

In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 8.2 percent to $127.44. Occupancy for these properties increased by 0.8 percentage points to 75.7 percent, and average daily rates
increased by 7.0 percent to $168.30. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. RevPAR increases as compared to the prior year were particularly strong in Central and South East Asia, South America, the Middle East,
and Eastern Europe.

The $34 million increase in segment results in 2007 as compared to 2006, reflects a $27 million increase in base
management, incentive management, and franchise fees, an $11 million increase in gains and other income, and a $3 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $7 million of higher general, administrative, and other
expenses. Incentive management fees included $2 million for 2007 that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until recognized, compared to $10 million of similar fees in 2006.

The increase in fees is largely due to strong demand and higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases and favorable exchange rates. The $11 million increase
in gains and other income reflects higher gains in 2007 on real estate sales, as compared to the year-ago period, offset by lower gains on the sale of joint ventures. The $7 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses from 2006
is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained flat primarily reflecting hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees of $8 million
received in 2007 and $12 million of similar fees in 2006, entirely offset by the improved performance of our owned and leased properties in 2007.



2006 Compared to 2005

Across our International Lodging segment, we added 22 properties (5,242 rooms) and 10 properties (3,136 rooms) left the system in 2006.

In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 11.1 percent to $114.61. Occupancy for these properties increased by 1.2 percentage points to 74.4 percent, and average daily rates
increased by 9.4 percent to $153.99. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. China, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and certain Middle Eastern countries all had strong RevPAR increases.

The $104 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $43 million increase in base management, incentive management,
and franchise fees, $37 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, $29 million of increased owned, leased, and other revenue net of expenses, and a $15 million increase in gains and other income, partially offset by $20 million of
lower equity results. Incentive management fees included $10 million and $4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until the periods they were recognized. The
increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property-level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms.

Equity results decreased by $20 million in 2006 versus 2005 and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $14 million in equity earnings from a joint venture
as a result of the venture’s sale of a hotel and $4 million of increased equity losses in 2006 associated with one joint venture’s hotel that was closed for renovation. The increase of $29 million in owned, leased, and other revenue net of
direct expenses reflects $19 million of improved results for owned and leased properties primarily due to the stronger demand environment and an increase of $12 million for hotel agreement termination fees for several properties. The $19 million
improvement in owned and leased results also reflects the impact of a $5 million charge in 2006 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” as it was not
sold within one year of its classification as “held for sale,” as had been expected.

The $15 million increase in gains
and other income is primarily attributable to gains on the sale of various joint ventures throughout 2006, partially offset by a decrease in other income associated with one of the sold cost method joint venture investments. The decrease in general,
administrative, and other expenses of $37 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $5 million associated with our bedding incentive program as well as a $34 million charge in 2005 associated with the CTF transaction
discussed more fully in the previous operating income disclosure. Also impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, in 2005 we recorded expenses totaling $6 million associated with two guarantees and 2006 reflected $7 million of increased
expenses related to unit growth and development, systems improvements, and increased ordinary costs such as wages and benefits.

Luxury Lodging

includes

The Ritz-Carlton

and

Bulgari Hotels & Resorts

.

2007 Compared to 2006

Across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added 11 properties (2,529 rooms) and one property (273 rooms) left the system in 2007. In addition, we added three residential products (347 units) in 2007.

In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased by 9.4 percent to $227.87. Occupancy for these properties increased by 1.8
percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.6 percent to $314.36.

The $9 million increase in segment
results, as compared to 2006, reflected a $20 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, partially offset by $3 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $6 million of increased general,
administrative, and other expenses, and $2 million of lower equity joint venture results. Fiscal year 2006 included $2 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, as
compared to no similar fees in 2007. The increase in fees over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR driven by rate increases, new properties added to



the system, the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years, the year-over-year
favorable impact associated with the reopening, late in 2006, of two properties impacted by the same aforementioned hurricanes and increased branding fees. The $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses is primarily
attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. The $3 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges totaling $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property
that was reclassified from “held and used,” as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as “held for sale,” partially offset by a favorable $3 million impact associated with the opening of a new leased
property in 2007.

2006 Compared to 2005

Across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added three properties (424 rooms) and one property (229 rooms) left the system in 2006.

In
2006, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased by 9.7 percent to $209.88. Occupancy for these properties increased by 1.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 7.5 percent to $289.50.

The $18 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $16 million increase in base management and incentive management
fees, $7 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses and $1 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $5 million of lower gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely
due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property-level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements, the growth in the number of rooms, and the recognition of $2 million of base management fees that were
calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006.

The decrease in general, administrative, and other
expenses of $7 million is attributable to a 2005 hotel management agreement performance termination cure payment of $12 million associated with one property, partially offset by a $5 million increase in expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to
unit growth and development and an increase in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Gains and other income decreased by $5 million in 2006 as a result of a $9 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity of a note
receivable associated with one property, partially offset by gains totaling $3 million associated with the 2006 sale of a preferred interest in one property.



Timeshare

includes our

Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by
Marriott

, and

Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club

brands.

2007 Compared to 2006

Timeshare contract sales, including sales made by our timeshare joint venture projects, represent sales of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential ownership products before the adjustment for
percentage-of-completion accounting. Timeshare contract sales decreased by 14 percent as compared to 2006, reflecting fewer residential and fractional sales, partially offset by increased timeshare sales. Contract sales in 2006 reflected
particularly strong joint venture residential sales associated with the launch of our San Francisco and Kapalua, Hawaii products.

The $225
million increase in Timeshare segment revenues from $1,840 million to $2,065 million reflected a $170 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue, a $46 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and $9 million of increased base
management fees. The increase in timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflects newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 and increased services and financing revenue. Higher base management fees reflect the growing
number of timeshare resorts under management. Timeshare segment revenues include $50 million and $41 million of interest income for 2007 and 2006, respectively, and note sale gains of $81 million and $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively,
recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income on the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable.

Segment results of $306 million in 2007 increased by $26 million over 2006 and primarily reflected $9 million of increased base management fees, $12 million of increased joint venture equity results, and $11 million
of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $7 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of expenses. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million,
as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, partially offset by the $15 million reversal
of contingency reserves in 2006 and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007,



offset by several other projects that were approaching sell-out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased
accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, as compared to 2006. As compared to the prior year, the $12 million increase in joint venture equity results primarily reflects strong demand in 2007 for our products in Kapalua, Hawaii
and start-up costs in 2006 associated with that joint venture. The $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected lower program and systems expenses in 2007.

2006 Compared to 2005

Timeshare contract sales
increased by 17 percent in 2006. Timeshare segment revenues of $1,840 million and $1,721 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, include $41 million and $38 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, of interest income, recorded in our Consolidated
Statements of Income on the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. The $119 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues reflects a $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and
services revenue, a $27 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and $2 million of increased base management fees. The $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note
securitization gains. As detailed earlier in the “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle” narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and
other income.

Segment results of $280 million in 2006 increased by $9 million over 2005. The $9 million increase includes an increase of
$98 million for Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses and a $2 million increase in base management fees, partially offset by a decline of $72 million in gains and other income, a $16 million increase in general, administrative,
and other expenses, and $3 million of lower joint venture equity earnings. The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $98 million largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains.
Note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Also reflected in the $98 million variance, development revenue net of expenses increased by $14 million primarily
reflecting lower development expenses in 2006 associated with projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with SOP 04-2, implemented in 2006. Additionally, the
$98 million variance reflected a $15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves and $12 million of higher financing revenue net of expense, partially offset by $21 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. The $3 million
decline in equity income primarily reflects start-up losses associated with several new joint ventures, partially offset by improved performance at other joint ventures. The $72 million decline in gains and other income primarily reflected $69
million of note securitization gains in 2005 versus the recording of note securitization gains in revenue for 2006, while the $16 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected higher program and joint venture development
expenses, and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits.

Investment in Leveraged Lease

Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta, which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of
rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the
lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $18 million through 2006. We recorded an additional $5 million loss related to this investment in fiscal 2007. We have no remaining exposure related
to this historical investment.

Effective Tax Rate

Tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years. As we exited the business in November 2007 our future effective tax rate is
likely to increase significantly, thereby reducing our after-tax profits.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Synthetic Fuel

The tax credits provided under
Internal Revenue Code Section 45K were only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through December 31, 2007. Given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phase-out of a significant
portion of tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on November 3, 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 2,
“Discontinued Operations,” and Footnote No. 17, “Contingencies,” in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment.



2007 Compared to 2006

For 2007, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $352 million versus revenue of $165 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting higher production in 2007. Production in 2006 reflected production
suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment declined from $5 million in 2006 to a loss of $1 million in 2007, primarily reflecting increased operating losses associated with higher production in
2007, partially offset by increased revenue and increased tax credits associated with higher production and, on the increased operating losses, a higher tax benefit. Results for 2007 also reflect an estimated 70.71 percent phase-out of tax credits
due to high oil prices versus a phase-out that was estimated at year-end 2006 to be 39 percent for 2006. Additionally, results in 2007 reflect interest costs of $8 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices.

2006 Compared to 2005

For 2006, the
synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $165 million versus revenue of $421 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting significantly lower production in 2006 as a result of production suspensions instituted in response to high oil
prices. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment declined from $125 million in 2005 to $5 million in 2006, primarily as a result of both lower production in 2006 and the estimated 39 percent phase-out of tax credits at year-end 2006 due to high oil
prices in 2006. Additionally, results in 2006 reflect interest costs of $4 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices. Segment results for 2006 also reflect a $5 million charge reflecting the write-down of assets at
the Alabama production facility as the adjacent mine was closed at year-end and we did not anticipate operating the facility again at this location.

Distribution Services

In 2005, we had income, net of tax, of $1 million associated with the distribution services business
that we exited in 2002.

New Accounting Standards

FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

We adopted FASB Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”) on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” which seeks to standardize practices associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement
recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Under FIN 48,
an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 of $155 million as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings and additional paid-in-capital on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets-an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140”

We adopted FASB’s FAS No. 156 on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FAS No. 156 requires that all separately
recognized servicing assets and liabilities initially be measured at fair value, if practicable. It also allows an entity to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities. We recorded the cumulative effect of
applying FAS No. 156, of $1 million, net of tax, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on December 30, 2006. See Footnote No. 11, “Asset Securitizations,” for additional information.

Future Adoption of Accounting Standards

EITF Issue No. 06-8,
“Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums”

In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force of FASB (“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the
Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums” (“EITF 06-8”). EITF 06-8 will require condominium sales to meet the continuing
investment criterion in FAS No. 66 in order to recognize profit under the



percentage of completion method. EITF 06-8 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2007, which for us begins with our
2008 fiscal year. The cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8, if any, will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We do not expect the impact of adoption of EITF 06-8 to be material.

FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS No. 157”). This standard defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and
expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. Provisions of FAS No. 157 must be applied
prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which FAS No. 157 is applied. In November 2007, the FASB agreed to partially defer the effective date, for one year, of FAS No. 157, for non-financial assets and liabilities,
except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115”

In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“FAS No. 159”). This standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for the
first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect to elect the fair value measurement option for any financial assets or liabilities at the present time.

EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real
Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause”

In December 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue
No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause” (“EITF 07-6”). EITF
07-6 clarifies whether a buy-sell clause is a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No. 66. EITF 07-6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing
transactions originally accounted for under the deposit, profit-sharing, leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy-sell clause performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, which for us begins
with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect EITF 07-6 to have a material impact on our financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations”

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised
2007), “Business Combinations” (“FAS No. 141(R)”). FAS No. 141(R) will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS No. 141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. FAS No. 141(R) also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the
impact that FAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, “Non-controlling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB No. 51”

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160,
“Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 51” (“FAS No. 160”). FAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards
for a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a non-controlling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements
separate from the parent’s equity. The amount of net income attributable to the non-controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No. 160 clarifies that changes in a parent’s
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when
a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non-controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of
the



parent and its non-controlling interest. FAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after
December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities

We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit
agreement that provides for borrowings and letters of credit and supports our commercial paper program. On May 14, 2007, we amended and restated this facility to increase the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from $2 billion to
$2.5 billion and extended the expiration of the facility from 2011 to 2012. The material terms of the amended and restated credit agreement were otherwise unchanged. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) plus a spread based on our public debt rating. Additionally, we pay annual fees on the facility at a rate also based on our public debt rating. We do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will
affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis.

At year-end 2007, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $2.151 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion under the credit facility,
plus our cash balance of $332 million, less letters of credit outstanding totaling $96 million, and less $585 million of outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate
from operations, adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements. We periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional
debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons, or to further strengthen our financial position.

We issue short-term commercial paper in the United States and in Europe. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the then-current demand for
our commercial paper in each of these markets, as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the
commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature.

We monitor the status of the
capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through
commercial paper borrowings and access to long-term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of
September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial
paper.

Cash from Operations

Cash from
operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows:

Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.2 to 1.0 at year-end 2007 and 1.3
to 1.0 at year-end 2006. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, aggressive collection efforts, and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit
facility should we need additional working capital.

Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the
calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows:

While our Timeshare segment generates strong operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varies based on
the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are
sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment):

Our ability to sell Timeshare segment notes is dependent upon continued liquidity within the
asset-backed and broader structured credit markets. While the recent dislocation in the capital markets has resulted in a general reduction in liquidity for new asset-backed issuances, we believe that demand remains sufficient for our continued sale
of Timeshare segment notes, albeit at somewhat less favorable terms. If the liquidity of the markets decreases further, or the underlying quality of any future Timeshare segment notes we originate were to deteriorate, we might have increased
difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales, although we do not expect such deterioration.

Investing Activities Cash Flows

Capital Expenditures and Other Investments.

Capital expenditures of $671 million in 2007, $529 million in 2006, and $780 million in 2005 included
expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in
“Cash from Operations,” as noted in that section’s narrative, are not reflected in these numbers. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party
purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such
real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact
on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments.

Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because:
(1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our
management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale.

At the end of 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and
marketed fractional ownership and residential interests. Subsequent to year-end 2007, we purchased our partner’s interest in the joint venture. Concurrent with this transaction, we purchased additional land from our partner as well. Cash
consideration for this transaction totaled $37 million and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $74 million and $37 million, respectively, on the date of purchase.

Dispositions.

Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $745 million in 2007, $798 million in 2006, and $298 million in 2005. In 2007, we closed on the sales of 13 properties and five joint venture
investments. Cash proceeds of $90 million for a parcel of land sold in 2007 are not reflected in the $745 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because of a contingency. Accordingly, these proceeds impacted the “Other
investing activities” section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows rather than “Dispositions.”

Loan
Activity.

We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the
loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2007, amounted to $75 million. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled



$7 million (which included a current portion of $4 million) at year-end 2007 and $9 million (which included a current portion of $1 million) at year-end
2006. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $206 million (which included a current portion of $18 million) at year-end 2007 and $268 million (which included a current portion of $32 million) at year-end 2006. In 2007 our notes receivable balance
associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, declined by $64 million and primarily reflects the repayment or sale of several loans and the reserve against an underperforming loan.

Equity and Cost Method Investments.

Cash outflows of $40 million in 2007 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our
investments in two joint ventures. Cash outflows of $95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in three joint ventures. Cash outflows of $216 million in 2005 associated with equity and
cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in 2005 of a 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC (“Whitbread”). For additional information regarding Whitbread see Footnote No. 10, “Marriott and Whitbread Joint
Venture” in our 2006 Form 10-K.

Cash from Financing Activities

Debt.

Debt increased by $1,132 million in 2007, from $1,833 million to $2,965 million at year-end 2007, due to the issuance of $346 million (book value at issuance) of Series I Senior Notes (described more
fully below), the issuance of $397 million (book value at issuance) of Series J Senior Notes (described more fully below), a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of $270 million and other debt increases of $119 million. Debt increased by $96
million in 2006, from $1,737 million to $1,833 million at year-end 2006, due to the issuance of $349 million (book value at issuance) of Series H Senior Notes, partially offset by a net reduction in commercial paper outstanding of $184 million, and
other debt decreases of $69 million.

In 2007, we issued $350 million of aggregate principal amount of 6.375 percent Series I Senior Notes
due 2017. The offering of the notes closed on June 25, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses of approximately $346 million from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used
these proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes will be paid on June 15 and December 15 of each year, and commenced on December 15, 2007. The notes will
mature on June 15, 2017, and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note.

Also in 2007, we issued $400 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.625 percent Series J Senior Notes due 2013. The offering of the notes closed on October 19, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses
of approximately $396 million from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used these proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, acquisitions, stock repurchases and
the repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes will be paid on February 15 and August 15 of each year, and commenced on February 15, 2008. The notes will mature on February 15, 2013, and are redeemable, in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note.

Both the Series I Senior Notes and the
Series J Senior Notes were issued under an indenture with The Bank of New York, successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, dated as of November 16, 1998.

Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working
capital. At year-end 2007, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 6.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.9 years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year-end 2007. At the end
of 2007, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB from Standard and Poor’s and Baa2 from Moody’s.

Subsequent to year-end
2007, on January 15, 2008, we made a $94 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our outstanding Series E Senior Notes.

Share Repurchases.

We purchased 41.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2007 at an average price of $43.32 per share, 41.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2006 at an
average price of $38.13 per share, and 51.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2005 at an average price of $32.12 per share. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of year-end 2007,
33.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors.

Dividends.

In April
2007, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 2 percent to $0.0750 per share.



Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2007:

Contractual Obligations

Our guarantees where we are the primary obligor of $315 million listed in the preceding table
include $41 million of operating profit guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties.

The guarantees where we are secondarily liable of $322 million in the preceding table include $245 million of guarantees that expire in the years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations
and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise”) is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CNL”), which
subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of
obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under the
guarantees.

The guarantees in the preceding table for which we are secondarily liable include lease obligations for which we became
secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $7 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $77 million. Most of these
obligations expire at the end of the 2023 calendar year. CTF has made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees (approximately €7 million [$11 million] remained at
year-end 2007). As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $77 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and
we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future.

Furthermore, in addition to the guarantees noted in the
preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions
from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is



34 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. We have also provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an
estimated aggregate total cost of $80 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our
pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 25 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. The carrying value of the liabilities associated with these two project completion guarantees is $7 million.

In addition to the guarantees described above, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in
which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions.

In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2007, we had extended approximately $4 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging
properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $2 million within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire after five years.

At year-end 2007, we also have commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase North
American full-service and limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel anchored mixed-use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $14 million in one to two years; and $30 million in three to five years. As of year-end 2007, we also
have a commitment to invest up to $25 million in a joint venture of which we have funded $12 million and have $13 million remaining that we expect to fund within one year. As of year-end 2007, we also had a commitment to invest up to $29 million
(€20 million) in a joint venture in which we are an investor. We currently do not expect to fund under this commitment.

At year-end
2007 we had $96 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of year-end 2007 totaled $468 million, the majority of which were requested by
federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance programs.

In the
normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact
on our net income and cash flow.



RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Equity Method Investments

We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management
and/or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 50 percent. The amount
of consolidated retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings attributable to our equity investments totaled $9 million at year-end 2007.

The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and
related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and

•

changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.



Marriott Rewards

Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and
residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members’ behalf, can be redeemed for stays at
most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating
properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures.

We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future
redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points
that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points.

Our management and
franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that
properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the
component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the
corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed.

Valuation of Goodwill

We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates
that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which
may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value.

Loan Loss Reserves

Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans

We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the
estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, that assumes certain
growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we
determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year-end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $112 million. We had a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $20 million of our investment in
impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2006, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $92 million. We had a $70 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $22 million of our investment in
impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2007 and 2006, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $102 million and $138 million, respectively.

Loans to Timeshare Owners

In
accordance with the adoption of SOP 04-2 in 2006, we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We
assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past three years.
We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales over the life of those notes. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, our allowance for credit losses associated with “Loans to timeshare
owners” totaled $19 million and $29 million, respectively.



Legal Contingencies

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances.

Income Taxes

We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets
and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about
future outcomes.

Changes in existing laws and rates and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount
of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates.

OTHER MATTERS

Inflation

Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices, and with respect to our synthetic fuel business, changes in oil prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring
available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or
foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future.

We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes
receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating-rate long-term debt and the fair
value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.

We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt
securities and common stock, which have a carrying value of $55 million at year-end 2007, which we account for as available-for-sale securities under FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.”

We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

At year-end 2007, we were party to the following derivative instruments:

•

An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by
effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap was $92 million and it matures in 2010.

•

Four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note
sales. Historically, we have been required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold-note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps was $157 million, and they expire
through 2022.

•

Option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during 2008. The aggregate dollar
equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was approximately $86 million, and they expire throughout 2008.

•

Forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts was
approximately $58 million, and they expire in 2008 and 2010.

•

Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional
amounts of the forward contracts was $133 million at year-end 2007.

•

Oil price hedges to manage the volatility associated with oil prices and the uncertainty surrounding the potential phase-out of tax credits in 2007. The hedges
cover 19 million barrels of oil and expired on December 31, 2007.



The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and
other financial instruments as of year-end 2007:

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Marriott International, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Company’s
transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In connection with the preparation of the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 28, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”). Management’s
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of December 28, 2007, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included
in this report, has issued an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on the next page of this annual report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of
Directors and Shareholders of Marriott International, Inc.:

We have audited Marriott International, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 28, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“the COSO criteria”). Marriott
International, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting - included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Marriott International, Inc. maintained in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Marriott International, Inc. as of December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows, comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 28, 2007, of Marriott International, Inc. and our report dated February 14, 2008
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows of Marriott International, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” or the “Company”).

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods, and the disclosures of contingent liabilities. Accordingly, ultimate results could differ from those
estimates.

As a result of the discontinuation of our synthetic fuel business on November 3, 2007, the balances and
activities of the synthetic fuel reportable segment have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

At the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, we adopted Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions,” (“SOP 04-2”) as issued by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants. The American Resort Development Association, a timeshare trade association of which we are a member and the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) had communications regarding SOP 04-2 and the
income statement presentation of timeshare note securitization gains. As a result of those communications, we now classify Timeshare segment note securitization gains within our “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption. Accordingly,
Timeshare sales and services revenue reflects Timeshare segment note securitization gains of $81 million and $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable totaling $69 million for 2005, are classified
within the “Gains and other income” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We have reclassified
certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2007 presentation. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position at fiscal year-end
2007 and fiscal year-end 2006 and the results of our operations and cash flows for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005. We have eliminated all material intercompany transactions and balances between entities consolidated in these financial statements.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to December 31. Unless otherwise specified, each reference to a particular year means the fiscal year ended on the date shown in the following table, rather than the corresponding calendar
year:

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues include: (1) base management and incentive management fees; (2) franchise fees; (3) revenues from lodging
properties and other businesses owned or leased by us; (4) timeshare sales and services, which also includes resort rental revenue, interest income associated with our “Loans to timeshare owners,” and for 2006 and 2007, Timeshare
segment note securitization gains, as noted in the “Basis of Presentation” caption earlier; and (5) cost reimbursements. Management fees comprise a base fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of hotels, and an incentive fee, which
is generally based on hotel profitability. Franchise fees comprise initial application fees and continuing royalties generated from our franchise programs, which permit the hotel owners and operators to use certain of our brand names. Cost
reimbursements include direct and indirect costs that are reimbursed to us by lodging properties that we manage or franchise.



Base Management and Incentive Management Fees

: We recognize base management fees as revenue
when earned in accordance with the contract. In interim periods and at year-end, we recognize incentive management fees that would be due as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by
us.

Franchise Fee Revenue

: We recognize franchise fees as revenue in each accounting period as fees are earned from the
franchisee.

Owned and Leased Units

: We recognize room sales and revenues from other guest services for our owned and leased
units when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered.

Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums

: We
recognize sales when: (1) we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price; (2) the purchaser’s period to cancel for a refund has expired; (3) we deem the receivables to be collectible; and (4) we have attained
certain minimum sales and construction levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the project has progressed beyond the
preliminary stages but has not yet reached completion, all revenue and profit are deferred and recognized in earnings using the percentage of completion method.

Timeshare Residential (Stand-Alone Structures)

: We recognize sales under the full accrual method of accounting when we receive our proceeds and transfer title at settlement.

Cost Reimbursements

: We recognize cost reimbursements from managed, franchised, and timeshare properties when we incur the related
reimbursable costs.

Other Revenue

includes third-party licensing fees, other branding fees, land rental income, and other
revenue.

Ground Leases

We are both the lessor and lessee of land under long-term operating leases, which include scheduled increases in minimum rents. We recognize these scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the initial
lease term.

Real Estate Sales

We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate” (“FAS No. 66”). We reduce gains
on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. In sales transactions where we retain a management contract, the
terms and conditions of the management contract are generally comparable to the terms and conditions of the management contracts obtained directly with third-party owners in competitive bid processes.

Profit Sharing Plan

We contribute to a profit sharing plan for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in the plan. Contributions are determined based on a specified percentage of salary deferrals by
participating employees. We recognized compensation costs from profit sharing of $107 million in 2007, $86 million in 2006, and $69 million in 2005.

Self-Insurance Programs

We are self-insured for certain levels of property,
liability, workers’ compensation and employee medical coverage. We accrue estimated costs of these self-insurance programs at the present value of projected settlements for known and incurred but not reported claims. We use a discount rate of
4.7 percent to determine the present value of the projected settlements, which we consider to be reasonable given our history of settled claims, including payment patterns and the fixed nature of the individual settlements.

We are subject to a variety of assessments related to our insurance activities, including those by state guaranty funds and workers’
compensation second-injury funds. Our liabilities recorded for assessments are reflected within the amounts shown in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on the self-insurance reserves line, are not discounted, and totaled $5 million for both year-end
2007 and year-end 2006. Our liability of $5 million as of year-end 2007 for assessments is expected to be paid by the end of 2008.



Marriott Rewards

Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our
lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies.
Points, which we track on members’ behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for
cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures.

We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the
fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the
“breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points.

Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including
marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue
from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of
the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Our liability for the Marriott Rewards program was
$1,392 million at year-end 2007 and $1,231 million at year-end 2006.

Guarantees

We record a liability for the fair value of a guarantee on the date a guarantee is issued or modified. The offsetting entry depends on the
circumstances in which the guarantee was issued. Funding under the guarantee reduces the recorded liability. When no funding is forecasted, the liability is amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the guarantee.

Rebates and Allowances

We participate in various vendor rebate and allowance arrangements as a manager of hotel properties. There are three types of programs that are common in the hotel industry that are sometimes referred to as
“rebates” or “allowances,” including unrestricted rebates, marketing (restricted) rebates and sponsorships. The primary business purpose of these arrangements is to secure favorable pricing for our hotel owners for various
products and services or enhance resources for promotional campaigns co-sponsored by certain vendors. More specifically, unrestricted rebates are funds returned to the buyer, generally based upon volumes or quantities of goods purchased. Marketing
(restricted) allowances are funds allocated by vendor agreements for certain marketing or other joint promotional initiatives. Sponsorships are funds paid by vendors, generally used by the vendor to gain exposure at meetings and events, which are
accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the event.

We account for rebates and allowances as adjustments of the prices
of the vendors’ products and services. We show vendor costs and the reimbursement of those costs as reimbursed costs and cost reimbursements revenue, respectively; therefore, rebates are reflected as a reduction of these line items.

Cash and Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash, totaling $153 million and $117 million at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006,
respectively, is recorded in the “Other long-term assets” line in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash primarily consists of deposits received on timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential sales that
are held in escrow until the contract is closed.



Assets Held for Sale

We consider properties (other than Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products, which we classify as
inventory) to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met:

•

management commits to a plan to sell a property;

•

it is unlikely that the disposal plan will be significantly modified or discontinued;

•

the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition;

•

actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated;

•

sale of the property is probable and we expect the completed sale will occur within one year; and

•

the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value.

Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property at the lower of its carrying value or its
estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we cease depreciation.

Assets held for sale totaled $123 million
at year-end 2007 and consisted of property and equipment. The $123 million total reflected the following segment composition: North American Full-Service-$17 million; North American Limited-Service-$17 million; and Luxury-$89 million. There were no
liabilities of assets held for sale at year-end 2007.

Assets held for sale totaled $411 million at year-end 2006 and
consisted of property and equipment of $391 million, accounts receivable of $10 million, cash of $6 million, and other assets of $4 million. The $411 million total reflected the following segment composition: International Lodging-$295 million;
Luxury Lodging-$73 million; and North American Full-Service Lodging-$43 million. Liabilities of assets held for sale totaled $102 million at year-end 2006 and consisted of debt totaling $81 million, accounts payable of $11 million, accrued payroll
and benefits of $8 million, and other payables and accruals of $2 million.

In 2007 we reclassified the balances associated
with one property, in conformity with other “held and used” properties, as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as “held for sale.” In conjunction with that reclassification, we recorded depreciation
expense of $4 million in 2007 that would have been recognized in 2006 and $4 million in late 2007 that would have been recognized earlier in 2007 had the asset been continuously classified as “held and used.”

Loan Loss Reserves

Lodging
Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans

We measure loan impairment based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded
investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose
of applying such policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis.

Loans to
Timeshare Owners

We record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from
timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate
uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past three years. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales over the life of those
notes.

Valuation of Goodwill

We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the
asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for
goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value.



Investments

We consolidate entities that we control. We account for investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting when we
exercise significant influence over the venture. If we do not exercise significant influence, we account for the investment using the cost method of accounting. We account for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies using
the equity method of accounting when we own more than a minimal investment. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments varies generally from 10 percent to 50 percent.

The fair value of our available-for-sale securities totaled $55 million and $107 million at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006,
respectively.

We included net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities of $9 million at year-end 2007 and $35 million at year-end 2006 in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of net gains reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the sale of available-for-sale securities totaled $18 million and zero for 2007 and 2006, respectively. We determined the cost basis of the securities sold using specific identification.

Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects

We charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. Selling and marketing costs
capitalized were $6 million at year-end 2007 and $16 million at year-end 2006 and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in the “Other” caption within the “Current assets” section. If a contract is canceled,
we charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record deposits forfeited as income.

Residual Interests

We periodically sell notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval
and fractional products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests.
The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. Prior to the start of the 2007 fiscal year, we measured servicing assets at the date of sale at their
allocated previous carrying amount based on relative fair value, classified those assets as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“FAS
No. 115”), and recorded those assets at amortized cost. On December 30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007, we adopted FAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets-an Amendment of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 140” (“FAS No. 156”). FAS No. 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. It also
allows an entity to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities. In conjunction with the adoption of FAS No. 156, we elected to subsequently measure our servicing assets using the fair value method. Under
the fair value method, we carry servicing assets on the balance sheet at fair value and report the changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected cash flows, in
earnings in the period in which the change occurs. For additional information regarding the adoption of FAS No. 156, see Footnote No. 11, “Asset Securitizations.”

We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as “trading” securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115.
At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these residual interests,
including servicing assets, through the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

The rate of prepayment of loans
serviced is the most significant estimate involved in the measurement process. Estimates of prepayment rates are based on management’s expectations of future prepayment rates, reflecting our historical rate of loan repayments, industry trends,
and other considerations. Actual prepayment rates differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the availability of alternative financing sources to borrowers. If
actual prepayments of the loans being serviced were to occur more slowly than had been projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase, and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts. Accordingly, the servicing
assets actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially recorded.

Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.



We record all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities. We recognize,
currently in earnings, changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and of derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments. We record changes in the fair value of the hedged item in a fair value hedge as an
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognize the change in the fair value of the derivative in earnings in the same income statement line item.

We record the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments as a component of
other comprehensive income and report the ineffective portion currently in earnings. We reclassify amounts included in other comprehensive income into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings.

Foreign Operations

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating in the United States. The functional currency for our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating outside of the United States is
generally the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. We translate the financial statements of consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars,
and we do the same, as needed, for unconsolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We translate assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date and translate income statement
accounts using the weighted average exchange rate for the period. We include translation adjustments from foreign exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature as a separate component
of shareholders’ equity. We report gains and losses from foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment nature, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions, currently in operating costs and expenses, and those amounted to a $2 million loss in 2007, a $6 million gain in 2006, and a $5 million loss in 2005. Gains and other income for 2007 included $6 million attributable to currency
translation adjustment gains, net of losses, from the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of investments. There were no similar gains or losses in 2006 or 2005.

New Accounting Standards

FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

We adopted FASB Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”) on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” which seeks to standardize practices associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement
recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Under FIN 48,
an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 of $155 million as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings and additional paid-in-capital on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. See Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” for additional information.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets-an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140”

We adopted FASB’s FAS No. 156 on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FAS
No. 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities initially be measured at fair value, if practicable. It also allows an entity to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and
liabilities. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying FAS No. 156, of $1 million, net of tax, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on December 30, 2006. See Footnote No. 11, “Asset
Securitizations,” for additional information.

Future Adoption of Accounting Standards

EITF Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for
Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums”

In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force of FASB
(“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums”
(“EITF 06-8”). EITF 06-8 will require condominium sales to meet the continuing investment criterion in FAS No. 66 in order to recognize profit under the



percentage of completion method. EITF 06-8 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2007, which for us begins with our
2008 fiscal year. The cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8, if any, will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We do not expect the impact of adoption of EITF 06-8 to be material.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS No. 157”). This standard
defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us begins with
our 2008 fiscal year. Provisions of FAS No. 157 must be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which FAS No. 157 is applied. In November 2007, the FASB agreed to partially defer the effective date, for one
year, of FAS No. 157, for non-financial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 157 will have
on our financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS
No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“FAS No. 159”). This standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect to elect the fair value measurement option for any
financial assets or liabilities at the present time.

EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to
the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause”

In December 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the
Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause” (“EITF 07-6”). EITF 07-6 clarifies whether a buy-sell clause is a prohibited form of
continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No. 66. EITF 07-6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit, profit-sharing,
leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy-sell clause performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect EITF 07-6 to have a material
impact on our financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations”

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
(“FAS No. 141(R)”). FAS No. 141(R) will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS No. 141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. FAS No. 141(R) also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 141(R) will have
on our financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements-an Amendment of ARB No. 51”

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160,
“Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 51” (“FAS No. 160”). FAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards
for a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a non-controlling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements
separate from the parent’s equity. The amount of net income attributable to the non-controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No. 160 clarifies that changes in a parent’s
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when
a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non-controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of
the



parent and its non-controlling interest. FAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after
December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements.

2.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Our
synthetic fuel operations consisted of four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities (the “Facilities”). Because tax credits under Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code are not available for the production and sale of
synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar year-end 2007, and because high oil prices during 2007 will result in the phase-out of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, on
November 3, 2007, we shut down the Facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel. Accordingly, we now report this business segment as a discontinued operation. The book value of the Facilities was zero at year-end 2007, as the
Facilities have been transferred to third parties. Under the site leases for the Facilities, we were required to restore the leased premises to substantially the condition the premises were in when the leases were originally executed. However, we
executed agreements with the lessors of the sites pursuant to which we transferred the Facilities to the lessors in exchange for the release of our obligations to restore the leased premises to their original condition. Costs associated with
shutting down the synthetic fuel operation and transferring the Facilities to the site lessors were not material.

The
following table provides additional income statement and balance sheet information relating to the discontinued operations:

INCOME TAXES

We adopted the
provisions of FIN 48, on December 30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recorded a $155 million increase in the net liability for unrecognized tax positions, which was recorded as an
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital on December 30, 2006. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2007 was $132 million. Included in the balance at year-end 2007 were $97
million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions, and it
is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 52-week period. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that a
significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur.



The unrecognized tax benefit reconciliation from beginning balance to ending balance is
as follows:

In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. This policy did not change as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 28, 2007, and our Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of that date include interest of $18 million and $8 million, respectively.

We file income tax returns,
including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program (CAP) for the 2006 and 2007 tax years and we intend to participate for 2008. This program
accelerates the examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is filed. Our 2005 federal income tax return is currently being examined by the IRS in a traditional audit process. In June 2007, we received
IRS Revenue Agents Reports for both the 2000 through 2002 and 2003 through 2004 examination cycles. We have fully resolved all issues and are in the final stages of closing these years. Various state, local, and foreign income tax returns are also
under examination by taxing authorities. We do not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on our financial statements.

As disclosed in our 2006 Form 10-K, the IRS was then auditing the Company’s federal tax returns for the 2000, 2001, and 2002 fiscal years. As part of that audit, the IRS reviewed a leveraged employee stock
ownership plan (“ESOP”) feature of the Company’s Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan (the “Plan”) that was implemented in a transaction (the “ESOP transaction”) on June 13, 2000.
Principal and interest on the debt related to the transaction was forgiven over a 26-month period as a mechanism for funding Company contributions of elective deferrals and matching contributions to the Plan. We claimed federal income tax deductions
for the forgiven principal on the debt in the amount of $1 billion over that period, along with forgiven interest on the debt. The benefit related to the tax deductions was reflected in equity and did not flow through the provision for income taxes.

On June 7, 2007, we reached a settlement of issues raised during the IRS’ and Department of Labor’s
examination of the ESOP feature of the Plan. The settlement resulted in an after-tax charge in the 2007 second quarter totaling $54 million and a reduction in shareholders’ equity of $115 million. The $54 million charge included $35 million of
excise taxes (impacting general, administrative, and other expense), $13 million of interest expense on those excise taxes, and $6 million of income tax expense primarily reflecting additional interest. As a result of the settlement, we have made
cash payments to the U.S. Treasury and state tax jurisdictions of $205 million through year-end 2007. The remaining cash payments of approximately $1 million are expected to be made in 2008. The payments reflect income taxes, excise taxes, and
interest charges. No penalties were assessed.

Total deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2007 and year-end
2006, were as follows:

The tax effect of each type of temporary difference and carry-forward that gives rise to
a significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, were as follows:

At year-end 2007, we had approximately $74 million of tax credits that expire
through 2027, $226 million of tax credits that do not expire, and $656 million of net operating losses, of which $360 million expire through 2027. The valuation allowance decreased due to foreign net operating losses that we believe will be realized
and the expiration of state net operating losses.

We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes or additional foreign
taxes on the cumulative unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries ($738 million as of year-end 2007) because we consider these earnings to be permanently invested. These earnings could become subject to additional taxes if remitted as dividends,
loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate or if we sold our interests in the affiliates. We cannot practically estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on the unremitted earnings. We conduct business in countries that grant a
“holiday” from income taxes for 10- and 30-year periods. The holidays expire through 2034. The aggregate amount of taxes not incurred due to tax “holidays” and the related earnings per share impacts are $22 million ($0.06 per
diluted share), $22 million ($0.05 per diluted share), and $11 million ($0.02 per diluted share) for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

The (provision for) benefit from income taxes consists of:

The current tax provision does not reflect the benefits attributable to us
relating to the exercise of employee stock options of $115 million in 2007, $194 million in 2006, and $87 million in 2005. Included in the preceding table are tax credits of $4 million in each of 2007 and 2006, and $5 million in 2005. The taxes
applicable to other comprehensive income are not material.



A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory tax rate to our effective income tax rate for
continuing operations follows:

Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $350 million in 2007, $169 million
in 2006, and $182 million in 2005.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Under our
2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (“the Comprehensive Plan”), we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (“Stock Option Program”); (2) share appreciation rights for our
Class A Common Stock; (3) restricted stock units of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock
on the date of grant.

We adopted FAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method at the beginning of
our 2006 first quarter. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, we did not restate our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods to reflect the impact of FAS No. 123(R). For all share-based awards granted after
the date we adopted FAS No. 123(R) and for the unvested portion of previously granted share-based awards that were outstanding on that date, FAS No. 123(R) requires that we measure compensation costs related to our share-based payment
transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. Previously, under FAS No. 123 and APB
Opinion No. 25, we accounted for our share-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25 and recognized share-based compensation expense for all
awards except for our Stock Option Program awards. We recorded share-based compensation expense related to award grants of $62 million in 2005.

Under FAS No. 123(R), we recorded share-based compensation expense related to award grants of $104 million in 2007 and $108 million in 2006. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $162
million at year-end 2007 and $168 million at year-end 2006, and the weighted average period over which we expect the deferred compensation costs at year-end 2007 to be recognized is two years.



The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if we
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123 to share-based employee compensation in 2005. We have included the impact of measured but unrecognized compensation costs and excess tax benefits credited to additional
paid-in-capital in the calculation of diluted pro forma shares. In addition, we have included the estimated impact of reimbursements from third parties. The reported and pro forma net income and earnings per share figures for 2007 and 2006 in the
table are the same because we calculate share-based compensation expense under the provisions of FAS No. 123(R). We have included the 2007 and 2006 amounts in the table below to provide detail for comparative purposes to the 2005 amounts.

FAS No. 123(R) requires that share-based compensation expense be recognized
over the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service (the “substantive vesting period”). In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we showed
share-based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure only for option awards to retirement-eligible employees over the awards’ stated vesting period. In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we recorded share-based
compensation expense for our other awards to retirement-eligible employees over the awards’ stated vesting period. With the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested portion of awards
granted prior to adoption of FAS No. 123(R) and follow the substantive vesting period for awards granted after the adoption of FAS No. 123(R).

In accordance with FAS No. 123(R), we present the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based awards as financing cash flows. Prior to the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we reported the tax benefits
resulting from the exercise of share-based awards as operating cash flows. Tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based awards totaled $115 million, $194 million, and $87 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

The aggregate amount of cash we received from the exercise of stock options granted under share-based payment arrangements was $89
million, $184 million, and $125 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

We issue restricted stock units under the
Comprehensive Plan to certain officers and key employees and those units vest generally over four years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the restricted stock units over the
service period equal to the fair market value of the stock units on the date of issuance. Upon vesting, restricted stock units convert to shares and are distributed from treasury shares. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, we had approximately $145
million and $138 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to restricted stock units. Share-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units was $82 million, $77 million, and $52 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. The weighted average remaining term for restricted stock unit grants outstanding at year-end 2007 was two years. Restricted stock units converted and distributed during 2007, 2006, and 2005, had aggregate intrinsic values of $147
million, $78 million, and $52 million, respectively. The weighted average grant-date fair values of restricted stock units granted in 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $49, $35, and $32, respectively.



Changes in our outstanding restricted stock unit grants in 2007 were as follows:

Employee stock options may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise
prices or strike prices equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-qualified options generally expire 10 years after the date of grant, except those issued from 1990 through 2000, which expire 15 years after
the date of the grant. Most stock options under the Stock Option Program are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant.

We recognized compensation expense associated with employee stock options of $12 million in 2007 and $22 million in 2006. We did not
recognize any compensation expense associated with employee stock options in 2005. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, there was approximately $6 million and $18 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to employee stock
options. Upon the exercise of stock options, we issue shares from treasury shares.

Changes in our outstanding Stock Option
Program awards in 2007 were as follows:

Stock options issued under the Stock Option Program awards outstanding at year-end
2007, were as follows:

The weighted average grant-date fair value of the 33,000 options granted in 2007
was $19 and the options had a weighted average exercise price of $49. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the 24,000 options granted in 2006 was $13 and the options had a weighted average exercise price of $34. The total intrinsic value of
options outstanding at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 was $1,279 million and $1,368 million, respectively, and the total intrinsic value for stock options exercisable as of year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 was $624 million and $1,233 million,
respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was approximately $206 million, $309 million, and $173 million, respectively.

Employee share appreciation rights (“Employee SARs”) may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike
prices equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Employee SARs expire 10 years after the date of grant and generally both vest and are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of
the first four years following the date of grant. Non-employee share appreciation rights (“Non-employee SARs”) may be granted to directors at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of



our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-employee SARs expire 10 years after the date of grant and vest upon grant; however, they are
generally not exercisable until one year after grant. We first began issuing share appreciation rights in 2006. On exercise of SARs, employees or Non-employee directors receive the number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the number of
share appreciation rights that are being exercised multiplied by the quotient of (a) the final value minus the base value, divided by (b) the final value.

We recognized compensation expense associated with Employee SARs and Non-employee SARs of $5 million in 2007 and $3 million in 2006. At
the end of 2007 and 2006, we had approximately $7 million and $4 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to share appreciation rights. Upon the exercise of share appreciation rights, shares are issued from treasury shares.
During 2007 and 2006, we granted 0.4 million and 0.5 million, respectively, Employee SARs with a weighted average base value of $49 and $34, respectively, and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $19 and $13, respectively. During
2007 and 2006, we also granted 4,000 and 8,000, respectively, Non-employee SARs with a weighted average base value of $46 and $37, respectively, and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $20 and $18, respectively. No SARs have expired or been
forfeited in 2007. The total intrinsic value of SARs outstanding at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 was zero and $7 million, respectively, and the total intrinsic value of SARs exercisable as of year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 were each zero. The
total intrinsic value of SARs exercised during 2007 was $100,000. No SARs were exercised in 2006.

We use a binomial method
to estimate the fair value of each stock option or SAR granted. The assumptions for stock options for all years and employee SARs for 2007 and 2006 are noted in the following table:

For Non-employee SARs issued in 2007 and 2006, the only differences in the
assumptions versus employee SARs were the use of risk-free interest rates of 4.6 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively, and for each year’s issuances, an expected life of 10 years.

Estimated volatilities for 2007 and 2006 were based on the historical share-price volatility for a period equal to the stock
option’s or share appreciation right’s expected lives, ending on the day of grant, and calculated based on weekly data. The weighted average expected stock option or share appreciation right terms for 2007 and 2006 were a product of the
lattice-based binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors to calculate the expected terms.

We also
issue deferred stock units to Non-employee directors. These Non-employee director deferred stock units vest within one year and are distributed upon election. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, there was approximately $227,000 and $152,000,
respectively, in deferred costs related to Non-employee director deferred stock units. We recognized share-based expense associated with Non-employee director deferred stock units of $666,000, $492,000, and $416,000 for 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. During 2007 we granted 20,000 Non-employee director deferred stock units with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $46. For 2006 and 2005, we granted 18,000 and 21,000 Non-employee director deferred stock units with weighted
average grant-date fair values of $37 and $32, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of Non-employee director deferred stock units distributed during 2007, 2006, and 2005, was $0.3 million, $1.7 million, and $0.2 million, respectively. At
year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, there were 218,000 and 203,000, respectively, Non-employee deferred stock units outstanding, and the weighted average grant-date fair value of those outstanding deferred stock units was $24 and $21, respectively.

Although the Comprehensive Plan also provides for issuance of deferred stock bonus awards, deferred stock awards, and
restricted stock awards, our Compensation Policy Committee indefinitely suspended the issuance of deferred bonus stock commencing with our 2001 fiscal year and the issuance of both deferred stock awards and restricted stock awards commencing with
the 2003 fiscal year. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, there was approximately $4 million and $8 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to these suspended award programs, and the weighted average remaining term was two
years for such award grants outstanding at year-end 2007. Share-based compensation expense associated with these suspended award programs was $4 million, $6 million, and $10 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

At year-end 2007, 63 million shares were reserved under the Comprehensive Plan including 39 million shares under the Stock
Option Program and Share Appreciation Right Program.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The table below
illustrates the reconciliation of the earnings and number of shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

We compute the effect of dilutive securities using the treasury stock method and
average market prices during the period. We determine dilution based on earnings from continuing operations.

In accordance
with FAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share,” we have not included the following stock options and SARs in our calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices for the
applicable periods:

(a)

for the year ended December 28, 2007, 0.4 million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $45.91 to $49.03;

(b)

for the year ended December 29, 2006, no options, and

(c)

for the year ended December 30, 2005, no options.

6.

INVENTORY

Inventory, totaling
$1,557 million and $1,186 million as of December 28, 2007, and December 29, 2006, respectively, consists primarily of Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products totaling $1,536 million and $1,166 million as
of December 28, 2007, and December 29, 2006, respectively. Inventory totaling $21 million and $20 million as of December 28, 2007, and December 29, 2006, respectively, relates to hotel operating supplies for the limited number of
properties we own or lease. We value Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products at the lower of cost or net realizable value and generally value operating supplies at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out
method) or market. Consistent with recognized industry practice, we classify Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products inventory, which has an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months, as a current asset.



7.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

The
following table details the composition of our property and equipment balances at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006.

We record property and equipment at cost, including interest, rent, and real
estate taxes incurred during development and construction. Interest capitalized as a cost of property and equipment totaled $49 million in 2007, $32 million in 2006, and $30 million in 2005. We capitalize the cost of improvements that extend the
useful life of property and equipment when incurred. These capitalized costs may include structural costs, equipment, fixtures, floor, and wall coverings. We expense all repair and maintenance costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (three to 40 years), and we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset life or lease term. Depreciation expense totaled $162 million in 2007, $155 million in 2006,
and $156 million in 2005.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

2007 Acquisitions

During 2007, we acquired one full-service property, one limited-service property, and one extended-stay property for
cash consideration of $199 million. These three properties were acquired in conjunction with a land assemblage for a large hotel complex that is still in the formative development stage. In addition, we acquired certain land parcels in 2007 for cash
consideration of $52 million. Also during 2007, we acquired the fee simple interest in the improvements of three properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties for cash consideration of $58 million. The purchase
included one full-service property and two limited-service properties, which were each sold later in the same year.

During
the first half of 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our partner’s interest in the joint venture for $6 million. In conjunction
with that transaction, we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $90 million and $84 million, respectively, on the date of the purchase. During the first half of 2007, we were party to another venture that was established to develop and market
timeshare and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our partner’s interest in that joint venture, and concurrent with this transaction, we purchased additional land and assets from our partner as well. Aggregate cash
and notes payable issued for these transactions totaled $106 million, and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $182 million and $76 million, respectively, on the date of purchase.

At year-end 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional and whole ownership interests. Subsequent to year-end
2007, we purchased our partner’s interest in that joint venture and concurrent with this transaction, we purchased additional land from our partner as well. Cash consideration for this transaction totaled $37 million and we acquired assets and
liabilities totaling $74 million and $37 million, respectively, on the date of purchase.

2007 Dispositions

In 2007, we sold nine properties for cash proceeds of $601 million and recognized gains totaling $24 million. We continue to operate eight
of the nine properties under long-term agreements. We sold two parcels of land for $55 million in cash proceeds that were under development and recognized a gain of $2 million. We also sold the fee simple interest in the improvements of three
properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties, initially acquired in early 2007, for book value and received $58 million in cash proceeds. We continue to manage the properties under long-term agreements. Each of
the aforementioned sales was accounted for under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66. During the year, we also sold our interests in five joint ventures for cash proceeds of $30 million and recognized gains totaling $13
million. We had other asset sales during the year, which generated proceeds totaling $1 million. Cash flows totaling $745 million for all the preceding dispositions in 2007 are reflected in the “Dispositions” line in our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.



In 2007, we also sold land that was under development. Due to a contingency in the sales
contract, this sale was accounted for under the deposit method of FAS No. 66. Accordingly, the cash proceeds, totaling $90 million, were reflected in “Other investing activities” in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

2006 Acquisitions

During 2006, we acquired one full-service property for $130 million including aggregate cash consideration of $46 million plus the assumption of debt. In addition we acquired three other full-service properties for
aggregate cash consideration of $134 million. We sold each of the four properties to third-party owners during the 2007 fiscal year.

2006 Dispositions

In 2006 we sold our interest in the 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC
(“Whitbread”), which held 46 hotels consisting of more than 8,000 rooms and we received approximately $164 million in cash, net of transaction costs, which was approximately equal to the investment’s book value. We continue to manage
the hotels under the Marriott Hotels & Resorts and Renaissance Hotels & Resorts brands. We also sold our minority interest in five other joint ventures during 2006 for cash proceeds of $64 million and recognized gains of $43
million. Additionally, one cost method investee redeemed the preferred stock we held for $81 million in cash consideration and we recognized income of $25 million on the redemption.

During 2006 we also sold 10 full-service properties for cash proceeds of $487 million and recognized gains totaling $14 million.

We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66 and will continue to operate eight of the properties under long-term management agreements. The sold properties included eight properties
purchased in 2005 from CTF Holdings Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (collectively “CTF”). For additional information regarding the CTF transaction, see the “2005 Acquisitions” caption later in this footnote. Prior to the sale
of one property, balances associated with that property were reclassified in conformity with other “held and used” properties, in the first half of 2006 as the property was not expected to be sold, within one year of its classification as
“held for sale.” In conjunction with that reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $2 million in the first half of 2006 that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as “held and used.”
Cash proceeds of $26 million for one hotel sold in 2006 are not reflected in the disposition proceeds of $487 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because of a contingency and impacted the “Other investing
activities” section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows rather than “Dispositions.” The contingency was subsequently resolved and sale accounting was achieved in 2006. Other asset sales generated cash proceeds of $2 million.

Late in 2006, we sold a 75 percent interest in a joint venture to a third party for its book value of $14 million. At the
time of the sale, the joint venture’s only asset was a parcel of land. In conjunction with the sale, we made a $25 million bridge loan to the joint venture, which matured in early 2007. Following the guidance found in EITF 98-8,
“Accounting for Transfers of Investments That Are in Substance Real Estate,” and FAS No. 66 due to our continuing involvement with the joint venture, we consolidated the joint venture for the period of time that the bridge loan was
outstanding. Subsequent to the bridge loan’s repayment, we account for our remaining interest in the joint venture under the equity method as required by APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
Stock.”

In 1988, the Company as landlord, entered into a 59-year ground lease with a lessee for land that was
improved with a hotel that is owned by the lessee. The hotel was previously branded a Marriott property. The lease contained contractual rental increases over the term of the lease and annual ground rent on the land totaled approximately $5 million
in 2006. The lease also contained a provision that permitted the lessee, under certain circumstances, to purchase the land for a fixed price. We and the lessee had various discussions in 2006 concerning the land as well as the hotel. During the 2006
second quarter, it became probable that none of the proposed transactions were acceptable to both parties and the lessee indicated its intent to exercise its option to purchase the land. Accordingly, in the 2006 second quarter, we reclassified the
land from the “Property and equipment” caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets to the “Assets held for sale” caption and recorded a $37 million non-cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value. We
completed the sale of the land, at book value, to the lessee in 2007 and this transaction is reflected in the figures noted earlier for dispositions in 2007.

2005 Acquisitions

During the third quarter of 2005, we purchased from CTF and
certain of its affiliates 13 properties (in each case through a purchase of real estate, a purchase of the entity that owned the hotel, or an assignment of CTF’s leasehold rights) and certain joint venture interests from CTF for an aggregate
price of $381 million. Prior to the sale, all of the properties were operated by us or our subsidiaries.



At the purchase date, we planned to sell eight of the properties to third-party owners
and the balances related to these full-service properties were classified within the “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities of assets held for sale” captions in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at year-end 2005. All eight
properties were sold in 2006. One operating lease terminated in 2005. At the purchase date we operated four remaining properties under leases, three of which expire by 2012. Under the purchase and sale agreement we signed with CTF in the second
quarter of 2005, we were obligated to purchase two additional properties for $17 million, the acquisition of which was postponed pending receipt of certain third-party consents. We did not purchase these additional two properties and the obligation
expired.

On the closing date we and CTF also modified management agreements on 29 other CTF-leased hotels, 28 located in
Europe and one located in the United States. We became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain of these hotels when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. At the closing date, we continued to manage 16 of these hotels
under new long-term management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF placed approximately $89 million in trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in
cash flow necessary to meet rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF from its guarantees in connection with these leases. In 2007, the lease agreement associated with one of these properties was terminated. In 2007, we also entered
into a transaction whereby the landlord allowed us to assume the lease agreement for another of the properties for which we then became the primary obligor. In conjunction with becoming the primary obligor, we received a $16 million distribution
from the trust, and the balance of the funds was distributed to the landlord. We accounted for our receipt of trust funds as a lease incentive, the reduction of which will be recorded on a straight-line basis as an adjustment to lease expense over
the term expiring in 2033. At year-end 2007, approximately $38 million remained in these trust accounts for the 14 properties we still manage and account for as leases. Minimum lease payments relating to these leases are as follows: $30 million in
each of 2008, 2009, and 2010; $26 million in 2011; $17 million in 2012; and $33 million thereafter, for a total of $166 million.

For 13 European leased hotels, of the 29 properties mentioned in the preceding paragraph, CTF may terminate management agreements with us if and when CTF obtains releases from landlords of our back-up guarantees. Pending completion of the
CTF-landlord agreements, we continue to manage these hotels under modified management agreements and remain secondarily liable under certain of these leases. We are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with
the leases. Third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts
under these guarantees in the future. CTF had originally made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we were required to fund under such guarantees. At year-end 2007, we still managed five of the original 13 properties.
Approximately €7 million ($11 million) of cash collateral remained available at year-end 2007. Our contingent liability exposure at year-end 2007 associated with the five remaining properties totaled $77 million as also noted in Footnote
No. 17, “Contingencies.” As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these remaining hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure will decline.

At the closing date, we continued to manage three other hotels in the United Kingdom under amended management agreements with CTF and
continued to manage 14 other properties in Asia on behalf of New World Development Company Limited and its affiliates. CTF’s principals are officers, directors, and stockholders of New World Development Company Limited. At the closing date, the
owners of the United Kingdom and Asian hotels agreed to invest $17 million to renovate those properties.

We and CTF also
exchanged legal releases effective as of the closing date and litigation and arbitration that was outstanding between the two companies and their affiliates was dismissed.

Simultaneously with the closing on the foregoing transactions, CTF also sold five properties and one minority joint venture interest to
Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. (“Sunstone”) for $419 million, eight properties to Walton Street Capital, L.L.C. (“Walton Street”) for $578 million, and two properties to Tarsadia Hotels (“Tarsadia”) for $29 million, in
each case as substitute purchasers under our purchase and sale agreement with CTF. Prior to consummation of the sales, we also operated all of these properties. At closing, Walton Street and Sunstone entered into new long-term management agreements
with us and agreed to invest a combined $68 million to further upgrade the 13 properties they acquired. At the closing date, the two properties purchased by Tarsadia were operated under short-term management and franchise agreements.



When we signed the purchase and sale agreement for the foregoing transactions in the 2005
second quarter, we recorded a $94 million pretax charge primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of the existing management agreements for properties involved in these
transactions. As described above, we entered into new long-term management agreements with CTF, Walton Street, and Sunstone at the closing of the transactions.

In 2005 we also purchased two full-service properties, one in Paris, France and the other in Munich, Germany, for aggregate cash
consideration of $146 million. We planned to sell these two full-service properties to third-party owners and the balances related to these properties were classified within the “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities of assets held
for sale” line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at year-end 2005. The property in Paris, France, was sold in 2006 and the property located in Munich, Germany, was sold in 2007. The balances associated with the Munich, Germany, property
were reclassified, in conformity with other “held and used” properties in the 2006 fourth quarter as the property was not sold at that time, as expected, within one year of its classification as “held for sale.” In conjunction
with the 2006 reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $5 million in the 2006 fourth quarter that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as “held and used.”

2005 Dispositions

Late in 2005, we contributed land underlying an additional nine Courtyard hotels, worth approximately $40 million, to CBM Land Joint Venture limited partnership (“CBM Land JV”), a joint venture the majority of which was owned, at
the time of the transaction, by a third party on behalf of an institutional investor, thereby obtaining a 23 percent equity stake in CBM Land JV. At the same time we completed the sale of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard by Marriott
hotels for approximately $246 million in cash to CBM Land JV. In conjunction with this transaction, we recognized a gain of $17 million in 2005, we deferred recognition of a $5 million gain due to our minority interest in the joint venture, and we
also deferred recognition of a $40 million gain due to contingencies in the transaction documents. As those contingencies expire in subsequent years, we will recognize additional gains. In each of 2007 and 2006, we recognized gains of $4 million,
and at year-end 2007, the aggregate remaining deferred gains totaled $37 million.

We also sold a number of other land
parcels in 2005 for $38 million in cash, net of transaction costs and recognized gains totaling $6 million, and we sold two minority interests in joint ventures for $14 million in cash and recognized gains totaling $7 million.

9.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The
following table details the composition of our goodwill and other intangible assets at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006.

We capitalize costs incurred to acquire management, franchise, and license
agreements that are both direct and incremental. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the agreements, ranging from 15 to 30 years. We evaluate the carrying values of intangible assets for impairment under the
provisions of FAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Amortization expense totaled $35 million in 2007, $33 million in 2006, and $28 million in 2005. Estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five
fiscal years is as follows: $29 million for 2008; $26 million for 2009; $26 million for 2010; $25 million for 2011; and $25 million for 2012.



10.

NOTES RECEIVABLE

The following
table details the composition of our notes receivable balances at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006.

We classify notes receivable due within one year as current assets in the caption
“Accounts and notes receivable” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, including $68 million and $70 million, as of year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, respectively, related to “Loans to timeshare owners.”

Our notes receivable are due as follows: 2008-$89 million; 2009-$51 million; 2010-$134 million; 2011-$58 million; 2012-$57 million; and
$300 million thereafter. The 2007 notes receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $25 million and the 2006 notes receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $28 million. Gains from the sale of notes receivable
totaled approximately $82 million, $79 million, and $94 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Lodging
Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans

Interest income associated with “Lodging senior loans” and
“Lodging mezzanine and other loans” is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in the “Interest income” caption. We do not accrue interest on “Lodging senior loans” and “Lodging mezzanine
and other loans” that are impaired. At year-end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired “Lodging senior loans” and “Lodging mezzanine and other loans” was $112 million and we had a $92 million allowance for credit losses,
leaving $20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2006, our recorded investment in impaired “Lodging senior loans” and “Lodging mezzanine and other
loans” was $92 million and we had a $70 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $22 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2007 and 2006, our average investment in
impaired loans totaled $102 million and $138 million, respectively.

The following table summarizes the activity related to
our “Lodging senior loans” and “Lodging mezzanine and other loans” notes receivable reserve for 2005, 2006, and 2007:



Loans to Timeshare Owners

At year-end 2007, the weighted average interest rate for our “Loans to timeshare owners” was 12.7 percent and the stated
interest rates associated with these loans ranged from zero to 19.9 percent. We reflect interest income associated with “Loans to timeshare owners” of $50 million, $41 million, and $38 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption. We do not accrue interest on “Loans to timeshare owners” that are over 90 days past due. Our recorded investment in “Loans
to timeshare owners” on nonaccrual status at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 totaled $59 million and $67 million, respectively. We established the reserve for “Loans to timeshare owners” notes receivable in 2006 in conjunction with
the adoption of SOP 04-2.

The following table summarizes the activity related to our “Loans to timeshare owners”
notes receivable reserve for 2006 and 2007.

11.

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS

We
periodically sell, without recourse, through special purpose entities, notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all
proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests. The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after
paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. Prior to the start of the 2007 fiscal year, we measured servicing assets at the date of sale at their allocated previous carrying amount based on relative fair value, classified
those assets as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No. 115 and recorded those assets at amortized cost.

On
December 30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007, we adopted FAS No. 156. In conjunction with the adoption of FAS No. 156, we elected to subsequently measure our servicing assets using the fair value method. Under the fair value
method, we carry servicing assets on the balance sheet at fair value, and report the changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected cash flows, in earnings in the
period in which the change occurs.

To determine the fair value of servicing assets, we use a valuation model that
calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income, which is based on the monthly fee we receive for servicing the securitized notes. We use market assumptions in the valuation model, including estimates of prepayment speeds,
default rates, and discount rates. We have inherent risk for changes in the fair value of the servicing asset but do not deem the risk significant and therefore, do not use other financial instruments to mitigate this risk.

Effective December 30, 2006, upon the remeasurement of our servicing assets at fair value, we recorded a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the 2007 beginning balance of retained earnings of $1 million after-tax ($2 million pretax) in our Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. Accordingly, servicing assets totaled $11 million at year-end 2006 and $13 million
on the first day of fiscal year 2007. At year-end 2007, servicing assets totaled $15 million.



The table below reconciles the servicing assets balance at year-end 2006, to the beginning balance on
December 30, 2006.

Principally represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash
flows over time and changes in fair value due to changes in key variables listed below.

Contractually specified servicing fees, late fees, and ancillary fees earned for 2007, 2006, and 2005 totaled $6 million, $5 million, and $4 million, respectively, and were reflected within the changes in fair value to the servicing assets
noted above.

We have included gains from the sales of timeshare notes receivable totaling $81 million in 2007 and $77
million in 2006 within the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable of $69 million in 2005 are in the “Gains and other income”
caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information regarding the classification of gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable, see the “Basis of Presentation” caption in Footnote No. 1,
“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” In addition, in September 2006, we repurchased notes receivable with a principal balance of $31 million and in November 2006, sold those notes, along with $249 million of additional notes in a
$280 million note securitization. The gain on the sale of these notes is included in the $77 million gain noted earlier in this paragraph.

We had residual interests of $238 million and $221 million, respectively, at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, which are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as other long-term receivables of $157
million and $137 million, respectively, and other current assets of $81 million and $84 million, respectively.

At the
dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. These transactions may utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest
margin associated with the beneficial interest. We report in income, changes in the fair value of residual interests, including servicing assets, as they are considered trading securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115. During 2007, 2006,
and 2005, we recorded trading gains of $30 million, $19 million, and $2 million, respectively. We used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, at the date of sale during 2007,
2006, and 2005: average discount rate of 9.02 percent, 9.22 percent, and 8.56 percent, respectively; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 25.02 percent, 25.22 percent, and 23.56 percent, respectively; expected weighted average
life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 75 months, 70 months, and 79 months, respectively; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults of 34 months, 32
months, and 38 months, respectively. Our key assumptions are based on experience.

We used the following key assumptions in
measuring the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, in our 11 outstanding note sales at year-end 2007: an average discount rate of 7.96 percent; an average expected annual prepayment rate, including defaults, of 19.58
percent; an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 62 months; and an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults of 35 months.

Cash flows between us and third-party purchasers during 2007, 2006, and 2005, were as follows: net proceeds to us from new
timeshare note sales of $515 million, $508 million, and $399 million, respectively; repurchases by us of defaulted loans (over 150 days overdue) of $30 million, $24 million, and $23 million, respectively; repurchases by us of other loans in 2006 of
$31 million; servicing fees received by us of $6 million, $5 million, and $4 million, respectively; and cash flows received from our retained interests of $100 million, $91 million, and $86 million, respectively.



At year-end 2007, $1,263 million of principal remained outstanding in all sales in which
we had a retained residual interest. Delinquencies of more than 90 days at year-end 2007 amounted to $10 million. Existing reserves were adequate for defaulted loans that were resolved during 2007. We have been able to resell timeshare units
underlying defaulted loans without incurring material losses.

We completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual
interests as of year-end 2007 with the objective of measuring the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. The methodology used applied unfavorable changes that would be considered statistically significant
for the key variables of prepayment rate, discount rate, and weighted average remaining term. The fair value of the residual interests was $238 million at year-end 2007, before we applied any stress test changes. An increase of 100 basis points in
the prepayment rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $4 million, or 1.9 percent, and an increase of 200 basis points in the prepayment rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $9 million, or 3.7 percent. An increase of 100 basis points
in the discount rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $5 million, or 2.3 percent, and an increase of 200 basis points in the discount rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $11 million, or 4.4 percent. A decline of two months in the
weighted average remaining term would decrease the year-end valuation by $3 million, or 1.1 percent, and a decline of four months in the weighted average remaining term would decrease the year-end valuation by $5 million, or 2.3 percent.

12.

LONG-TERM DEBT

Our long-term debt
at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 consisted of the following:

As of year-end 2007, all debt, other than mortgage debt and $1 million of other
debt, is unsecured.

During 2007, we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement, originally entered
into in 2005, to increase the aggregate borrowings and letters of credit available under the facility from $2 billion to $2.5 billion and to extend the expiration of the facility from 2011 to 2012. The availability of revolving credit borrowings
supports our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. Additionally, we pay quarterly fees on the facility at a rate also based
on our public debt rating.

In 2005 we began issuing short-term commercial paper in Europe in addition to our long-standing
commercial paper program in the United States. Our United States and European commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the commercial paper market, as we have no commitment from buyers to purchase our commercial



paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is
not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis.

During 2007, we issued $350 million of aggregate principal amount of 6.375 percent Series I Senior Notes due 2017. The offering of the
Notes closed on June 25, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses of approximately $346 million from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used these proceeds for general
corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes is paid on June 15 and December 15 of each year, and commenced on December 15, 2007. The notes will mature on June 15, 2017, and
are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note.

Also
in 2007, we issued $400 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.625 percent Series J Senior Notes due 2013. The offering of the notes closed on October 19, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses of approximately $396 million from
this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used these proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, and the
repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes is paid on February 15 and August 15 of each year, and commenced on February 15, 2008. The notes will mature on February 15, 2013, and are redeemable, in whole or
in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note.

Both the Series I Senior Notes
and the Series J Senior Notes were issued under an indenture with The Bank of New York, successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, dated as of November 16, 1998.

We are in compliance with covenants in our loan agreements, which require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and minimum
shareholders’ equity and also include, among other things, limitations on additional indebtedness and the pledging of assets.

Aggregate debt maturities are: 2008-$175 million; 2009-$118 million; 2010-$51 million; 2011-$19 million; 2012-$360 million; and $2,242 million thereafter.

Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $115 million in 2007, $73 million in 2006, and $87 million in 2005.

Subsequent to year-end 2007, on January 15, 2008, we made a $94 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at
maturity, all of our outstanding Series E Senior Notes.

13.

SELF-INSURANCE RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

The activity in the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is summarized as follows:



The provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $34 million and
$20 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a result of changes in estimates from insured events of the prior years due to changes in underwriting experience and frequency and severity trends. The year-end 2007 self-insurance reserve of $274
million is comprised of a current portion of $92 million and long-term portion of $182 million. The year-end 2006 self-insurance reserve of $271 million is comprised of a current portion of $87 million and a long-term portion of $184 million.

14.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Eight
hundred million shares of our Class A Common Stock, with a par value of $.01 per share, are authorized, and 10 million shares of preferred stock, without par value, are authorized. As of the 2007 fiscal year-end, there were
357.1 million shares of our Class A Common Stock outstanding and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding.

On March 27, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan
under which one preferred stock purchase right was distributed for each share of our Class A Common Stock. Each right entitles the holder to buy 1/1000

th

of a share of a newly issued series of junior participating preferred stock of the Company at an exercise price of $175. The rights may not presently be exercised, but will be exercisable 10 days after a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 20 percent or more of our Class A Common Stock or begins a tender or exchange for 30 percent or more of our Class A Common Stock. Shares owned by a person or group on March 27, 1998, and held continuously thereafter, are
exempt for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under the rights plan. The rights are nonvoting and will expire on March 27, 2008, unless previously exercised or redeemed by us for $.01 each. If we are involved in a merger or certain
other business combinations not approved by the Board of Directors prior to the expiration of the rights, each right entitles its holder, other than the acquiring person or group, to purchase common stock of either the Company or the acquirer having
a value of twice the exercise price of the right. The Company does not plan to extend the shareholder rights plan or the rights beyond their March 27, 2008 expiration.

Accumulated other comprehensive income of $51 million at year-end 2007 primarily consisted of gains totaling $9 million associated with
available-for-sale securities and gains totaling $46 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by net losses of $5 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges. Accumulated other
comprehensive income of $44 million at year-end 2006 primarily consisted of gains totaling $35 million associated with available-for-sale securities and gains totaling $12 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments.

15.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We believe that the fair values of current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts. The fair values of non-current financial assets, liabilities, and derivatives are shown in the following table.

We value notes and other receivables based on the expected future cash flows
discounted at risk-adjusted rates. We determine valuations for long-term debt and other long-term liabilities based on quoted market prices or expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates.

16.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

During
2007, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage the volatility of the U.S. Treasury component of the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of our Series I and Series J Senior Notes. During 2006, we entered into an
interest rate swap agreement to manage the volatility of the U.S. Treasury component of the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of our Series H Notes. During 2005, we entered into two similar instruments in conjunction with
the forecasted issuance of our Series F Notes and the exchange of our Series C and Series E Senior Notes for new Series G Notes. All five swaps were designated as cash



flow hedges under FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS No. 133”) and were
terminated upon pricing of the notes. All five swaps were highly effective in offsetting fluctuations in the U.S. Treasury component. Thus, there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings during 2007, 2006, or 2005. The net losses for these swaps
were $4 million in 2007 associated with the Series I and Series J Senior Notes, zero in 2006 associated with the Series H Senior Notes, and $2 million in 2005 associated with the Series F and Series G Senior Notes were recorded in other
comprehensive income and are being amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the life of the notes.

At
year-end 2007, we had four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and/or
rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $157 million, and they expire through 2022. These swaps are not accounted for as hedges under FAS
No. 133. The fair value of the swaps was a net asset of $2 million at year-end 2007 and $5 million at year-end 2006. For the outstanding interest rate swaps, we recorded a $3 million net loss during 2007, a $1 million net loss during 2006 and a
$2 million net gain during 2005.

During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate
risk associated with forecasted timeshare note sales. During 2007, five swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No. 133 and were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. The amount of the ineffectiveness was
immaterial. In 2007, we terminated two of those five swaps and recognized no gain or loss from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. The aggregate notional amount of the remaining three swaps is $238 million at year-end 2007, and they
expire through 2012. The fair value of the remaining three swaps was a net liability of $7 million at year-end 2007. For the outstanding interest rate swaps, we recorded in 2007 a $7 million net loss in other comprehensive income. During 2006, two
swaps (the “2006 swaps”) were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No. 133 and were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. In 2006, we terminated the 2006 swaps and recognized a net gain of $1 million in the
gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. During 2005, one swap was designated as a cash flow hedge under FAS No. 133 and was highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. The amount of the ineffectiveness was
immaterial and upon termination we recognized a net gain of $2 million in gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. The second swap entered into in 2005 did not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying swap resulted in a
loss of $3 million during 2005, which was also recognized in gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable.

During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of the contracts was $133
million at year-end 2007. The forward exchange contracts do not qualify as hedges in accordance with FAS No. 133. The fair value of the forward contracts was an asset of $2 million at year-end 2007 and zero at year-end 2006. We recorded a $10
million loss during 2007, a $34 million loss during 2006, and a $26 million gain in 2005, relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts. The net gains and losses for all years were recorded as general, administrative, and other expense and
were offset by income and losses recorded from translating the related monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.

During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we entered into foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates. The aggregate dollar
equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was $86 million at year-end 2007. These contracts have terms of less than one year and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair values are recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income. The fair value of the option contracts was approximately $1 million at year-end 2007 and zero at year-end 2006. We recorded an immaterial amount in general, administrative, and other expense due to changes in the time value of
these contracts, which is excluded from the assessment of our hedge effectiveness. The hedges were highly effective and there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings for 2007, 2006, and 2005. As of year-end 2007, the deferred gains or losses on
existing contracts accumulated in other comprehensive income that we expect to reclassify into earnings over the next year were zero.

During 2007, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the
contracts was $58 million at year-end 2007. These contracts have terms of less than three years and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of the
forward contracts was zero at year-end 2007. We recorded an immaterial amount in general, administrative, and other expense due to changes in the time value of these contracts, which is excluded from the assessment of our hedge effectiveness. The
hedges were highly effective and there was no gain or loss reported in 2007. As of year-end 2007, the deferred gains or losses on existing contracts accumulated in other comprehensive income that we expect to reclassify into earnings over the next
three years were $1 million.



During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage
currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts offset the gains and losses associated with translation adjustments for various investments in foreign operations. One contract was designated
as a hedge in the net investment of a foreign operation under FAS No. 133 at year-end 2006. The hedge was highly effective and resulted in a $1 million net loss for 2007, no net gain or loss for 2006, and a $1 million net loss for 2005 in the
foreign currency translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income. Certain contracts did not qualify as hedges under FAS No. 133 and resulted in no gain or loss for 2007, a loss of $17 million for 2006, and a gain of $3 million for
2005, impacting our general, administrative, and other expenses. No contracts remained at year-end 2007. One contract remained at year-end 2006, which had an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $43 million and a fair value of zero.
Contracts remaining at year-end 2005 had an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $229 million and a fair value of approximately zero.

During 2007 and 2006, in response to high oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the potential phase out of tax credits, we entered into oil price hedges in conjunction with our synthetic fuel operation. These hedges
do not qualify as cash flow hedges under FAS No. 133. Therefore, changes in the fair values of these instruments are marked-to-market through interest income at each reporting period. Correspondingly, we recorded a net loss of $8 million during
2007 and a net loss of $2 million during 2006. At year-end 2007, hedges with a total fair value of $4 million remained outstanding. At year-end 2006, hedges with a total fair value of $5 million remained outstanding.

During 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of
interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. The swap is classified as a
fair value hedge under FAS No. 133 and the change in the fair value of the swap, as well as the change in the fair value of the underlying note receivable, is recognized in interest income. The fair value of the swap was a $2 million liability
at year-end 2007, and a $1 million asset at year-end 2006 and 2005. The hedge is highly effective and, therefore, no net gain or loss was reported during 2007, 2006, and 2005.

17.

CONTINGENCIES

Guarantees

We issue guarantees to certain lenders and hotel owners primarily to obtain long-term management contracts. The guarantees generally have
a stated maximum amount of funding and a term of three to 10 years. The terms of guarantees to lenders generally require us to fund if cash flows from hotel operations are inadequate to cover annual debt service or to repay the loan at the end of
the term. The terms of the guarantees to hotel owners generally require us to fund if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. Guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans repayable to us
out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. We also enter into project completion guarantees with certain lenders in conjunction with hotels and Timeshare segment properties that we or our joint venture partners are
building.

The maximum potential amount of future fundings for guarantees where we are the primary obligor and the carrying
amount of the liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2007 are as follows:

Our guarantees of $315 million listed in the preceding table include $41 million
of operating profit guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties.

The guarantees of $315 million in the preceding table do not include $245 million of guarantees that expire in the years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for
which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise”) is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CNL”), which subsequently merged with Health
Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior
Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under the guarantees.



The table also does not include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable
when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $7 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $77 million. Most of these obligations expire at
the end of the 2023 calendar year. CTF had originally made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees (approximately €7 million [$11 million] remained at year-end
2007). As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $77 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not
expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future.

Furthermore, in addition to the guarantees noted in the
preceding table , we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions
from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. We have also provided a project
completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $80 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on
a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 25 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. The carrying value of the liabilities associated with these two project
completion guarantees is $7 million.

In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction
with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the
other joint venture owner or our own actions.

Commitments and Letters of Credit

In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2007, we had extended approximately $4 million of loan commitments to
owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $2 million within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire after five years.

At year-end 2007, we also have commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to
purchase North American full-service and limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel anchored mixed-use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $14 million in one to two years; and $30 million in three to five years. As of
year-end 2007, we also have a commitment to invest up to $25 million in a joint venture of which we have funded $12 million and have $13 million remaining that we expect to fund within one year. As of year-end 2007, we also had a commitment to
invest up to $29 million (€20 million) in a joint venture in which we are an investor. We currently do not expect to fund under this commitment.

At year-end 2007, we had $96 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf at year-end 2007, totaled $468
million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance programs.

Synthetic Fuel

The
tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuels were established by Congress to encourage the development of alternative domestic energy sources. Congress deemed that the incentives provided by
the tax credits would not be necessary if the price of oil increased beyond certain thresholds as prices would then provide a more natural market for these alternative fuels. As a result, the tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for
the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given calendar year are phased out if the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for that year falls within a specified range. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average
wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil and is determined for each calendar year by the Secretary of the Treasury by April 1 of the following year. In 2005 and 2006, the Reference Price was roughly equal to 89 percent and 90 percent,
respectively, of the average price in those years of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract for a barrel of light, sweet crude oil. The price range within which the credit is phased out was set in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation. In 2006,
the Reference Price phase-out range was $55.06 to $69.12. Because the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2006 was within that range, at $59.68, there was a 33 percent reduction of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in
2006.



Assuming a 2.5 percent inflation adjustment factor for 2007, and assuming the ratio of
the Reference Price to the average price of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract remains the same for November and December 2007 as it has been in the five preceding months, we currently estimate that the tax credits available for production and
sale of synthetic fuel in 2007 would begin to be phased out if the average price of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract in 2007 exceeds approximately $62 and would be fully phased out if the average price of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract in
2007 exceeds approximately $78. For the year ended December 28, 2007, our results reflect a provision for an estimated 70.71 percent tax credit phase-out as a result of high oil prices. The average price of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract
for 2007, through December 31, 2007, was approximately $72.41.

Late in 2006 and early in 2007, we entered into hedge
agreements to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits is phased out in 2007.

See Footnote No. 2, “Discontinued Operations,” earlier in this report, for additional information related to the synthetic fuel operations, including information related to the cessation of synthetic fuel production
permanently in November 2007.

Investment in Leveraged Lease

Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) which we
acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $18 million through 2006. We recorded an additional $5 million loss related to this investment
in fiscal 2007. We have no remaining exposure related to this historical investment.

18.

LEASES

We have summarized our
future obligations under operating leases at year-end 2007, below:

Most leases have initial terms of up to 20 years and contain one or more renewal
options, generally for five- or 10-year periods. These leases provide for minimum rentals and additional rentals based on our operations of the leased property. The total minimum lease payments above include $439 million, representing obligations of
consolidated subsidiaries that are non-recourse to Marriott International, Inc.

As discussed in Footnote No. 8,
“Acquisitions and Dispositions,” we became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain hotels when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. At year-end 2007, we continued to manage 14 of these hotels under
long-term management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF placed funds into trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in cash flow necessary to meet
rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF affiliates from their guarantees in connection with these leases. Approximately $38 million remained in these trust accounts at year-end 2007. Minimum lease payments relating to these
leases, which are not reflected in the $1,833 million in the preceding table are as follows: $30 million in each of 2008, 2009, and 2010; $26 million in 2011; $17 million in 2012; and $33 million thereafter, for a total of $166 million.



The composition of rent expense for the last three fiscal years associated with operating
leases is detailed in the following table:

, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts properties worldwide; and

•

Timeshare

, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide under
Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club.

In addition to the segments above, in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations.

In addition to the brands noted above, in 2007 we announced our new brand of family-friendly resorts and spas, “Nickelodeon Resorts
by Marriott” and a new brand of lifestyle boutique hotels, “Edition.” At year-end 2007, no properties were yet open under either brand.

In 2006, we analyzed our internal reporting process and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency and, as part of this process, we evaluated the impact on segment reporting.
Accordingly, we now report five operating segments, and no longer allocate indirect administrative expenses to our segments. We reflect this revised segment reporting throughout this report for all periods presented, and present historical figures
in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting. See also the Form 8-K that we filed on March 19, 2007, furnishing quarterly Revenues and Income from Continuing Operations for each of 2006 and 2005 in the new segment format.



We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment
without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments. Because note sales are an integral
part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results. We include interest income associated with Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that
segment’s business. We also allocate other gains or losses as well as equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative, and other expenses to each of our segments. “Other unallocated
corporate” represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments.

We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and
Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational and management reporting
structure.

Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees



Goodwill

Segment expenses include selling expenses directly related to the operations of
the businesses, aggregating $616 million in 2007, $600 million in 2006, and $609 million in 2005. Approximately 89 percent for 2007 and 90 percent for each of 2006 and 2005 of the selling expenses are related to our Timeshare segment.

The consolidated financial statements include the following related to operations located outside the United States (which are
predominately related to our International lodging segment): Revenues of $2,287 million in 2007, $1,869 million in 2006, and $1,388 million in 2005; segment financial results of $341 million in 2007 (32 percent from Europe, 30 percent from the
Americas excluding the United States, 17 percent from Asia, 11 percent from the United Kingdom, 8 percent from the Middle East and Africa, and 2 percent from Australia), $298 million in 2006, and $178 million in 2005; and fixed assets of $257
million in 2007 and $684 million in 2006. At year-end 2007, fixed assets totaling $257 million located outside the United States are included within the “Property and equipment” caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At year-end 2006,
fixed assets totaling $684 million located outside the United States include fixed assets of $336 million which are included within the “Property and equipment” caption and $348 million of fixed assets which are included within the
“Assets held for sale” caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. No individual country, other than the United States, constitutes a material portion of our revenues, financial results or fixed assets.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

We
currently consolidate a holding company that holds 100 percent interest in four entities that are variable interest entities under FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-revised” (“FIN 46(R)”). At year-end 2007, the
combined capital in the four variable interest entities is less than $1 million, which is used primarily to fund hotel working capital. Our equity at risk was $3 million and we held 55 percent of the common equity shares of the holding company. The
creditors of the holding company do not have general recourse to our credit.

We are party to a venture that develops and
markets fractional ownership and residential interests. During the 2007 second quarter, we issued a guarantee to the senior lender of the venture in support of the senior loan facility and reevaluated our variable interests in the venture under FIN
46(R). At that time, we determined that we were the primary beneficiary and as such, we also consolidated this venture. During the 2007 third quarter, the guarantee was replaced with the issuance of a loan facility for $40 million, of which $36
million is receivable and outstanding at year-end 2007. Our issuance of the loan facility was a reconsideration event under FIN 46(R); we again determined we were the primary beneficiary and continue to consolidate the joint venture. At year-end
2007, the carrying amount of consolidated assets that are collateral for the variable interest entity’s obligations totaled $141 million and comprised $24 million of accounts receivable, $106 million of real estate held for development,
property, equipment, and other long-term assets, and $11 million of cash. The creditors of the variable interest entity do not have general recourse to our credit.



In conjunction with the transaction with CTF described more fully in Footnote No. 8,
“Acquisitions and Dispositions,” under the caption “2005 Acquisitions” we manage certain hotels on behalf of four tenant entities 100 percent owned by CTF, which lease the hotels from third-party owners. At year-end 2007, the
number of hotels totaled 14. The entities have minimal equity and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital. CTF placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. The terms of the trust require that the
cash flows for the four tenant entities be pooled for purposes of making rent payments and determining cash flow shortfalls. At year-end 2007, the trust account held approximately $38 million. The entities are variable interest entities under FIN
46(R). We do not consolidate the entities because we do not bear the majority of the expected losses. We are secondarily liable for rent payments for eight of the 14 hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls and there is no money left
in the trust. Future minimum lease payments through the end of the lease term for these eight hotels total approximately $122 million. In addition, we are also secondarily liable for rent payments of up to an aggregate cap of $44 million for the six
other hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)), and management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable
assurance regarding management’s control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based upon the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
