FISCAL
YEAR ENDED JANUARY 2, 2009



Throughout this report, we refer to Marriott International, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, as
“we,” “us,” or “the Company.” Unless otherwise specified, each reference to a particular year means the fiscal year ended on the date shown in the table below, rather than the corresponding calendar year:

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

We are a worldwide operator and
franchisor of hotels and related lodging facilities. We were organized as a corporation in Delaware in 1997 and became a public company in 1998 when we were “spun off” as a separate entity by the company formerly named “Marriott
International, Inc.” Our operations are grouped into the following five business segments:

Prior to November 3, 2007, our operations also included our synthetic fuel business, which we
now classify as discontinued operations.

Our business includes our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service,
International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments. We develop, operate, and franchise hotels and corporate housing properties under 14 separate brand names, and we develop, operate, and market timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties
under four separate brand names. We also provide services to home/condominium owner associations for projects associated with several of our brands.

Financial information by segment and geographic area for the 2008, 2007, and 2006 fiscal years appears in Footnote No. 19, “Business Segments,” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements
included in this annual report.



Lodging

We operate or franchise 3,178 lodging properties worldwide, with 560,681 rooms as of year-end 2008 inclusive of 27 home and condominium products (2,482 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we
provided 2,332 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. We believe that our portfolio of lodging brands is the broadest of any company in the world and that we are the leader in the quality tier of the vacation
timesharing business. Consistent with our focus on management and franchising, we own very few of our lodging properties. We manage and franchise lodging properties employing the following brands:

*

At year-end 2008, no Edition properties were yet open.

The North American Full-Service segment and the North American Limited-Service segment include properties located in the continental United States and Canada. The Luxury segment includes worldwide properties. The International segment
includes full-service and limited-service properties located outside the continental United States and Canada. Unless otherwise indicated, our references to Marriott Hotels & Resorts throughout this report include Marriott Conference
Centers and JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, references to Renaissance Hotels & Resorts include Renaissance ClubSport, and references to Fairfield Inn include Fairfield Inn & Suites.

Company-Operated Lodging Properties

At year-end
2008, we operated 1,058 properties (270,935 rooms) under long-term management agreements with property owners, 35 properties (9,165 rooms) under long-term lease agreements with property owners (management and lease agreements together, “the
Operating Agreements”), and six properties (1,448 rooms) as owned. The figures noted for properties operated under long-term management agreements include 27 residential products (2,482 units) for which we manage the related owners’
associations.

Terms of our management agreements vary, but typically, we earn a management fee, which comprises a base management fee,
which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. Our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations (both direct and indirect). Such
agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years, with options to renew for up to 50 or more additional years. Our lease agreements also vary, but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a percentage of annual
revenues in excess of a fixed amount. Many of the Operating Agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners. Additionally, many of our Operating Agreements permit the owners to terminate the agreement if
certain performance metrics are not met and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured such deficiencies.

For lodging facilities that we operate, we generally are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising the managers and employees required to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies, both for which we
generally are reimbursed by the owners. We provide centralized reservation services and national advertising, marketing and promotional services, as well as various accounting and data processing services. We are generally reimbursed by owners for
the cost of providing these services.



Franchised Lodging Properties

We have franchising programs that permit the use of many of our lodging brand names and systems by other hotel owners and operators. Under these programs, we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing
royalty fees, which typically range from 4 percent to 6 percent of room revenues for all brands, plus 2 percent to 3 percent of food and beverage revenues for certain full-service hotels. In addition, franchisees contribute to our national marketing
and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems. At year-end 2008, we had 2,079 franchised properties (279,133 rooms).

Timeshare and Residential

We develop, operate, market, and sell
timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties under four brand names and generate revenues from three primary sources: (1) selling fee simple and other forms of timeshare intervals and personal residences;
(2) financing consumer purchases; and (3) operating the resorts. Many resorts are located adjacent to company-operated hotels, such as Marriott Hotels & Resorts and The Ritz-Carlton, and owners have access to certain hotel
facilities during their vacation. Owners can trade their annual interval for intervals at other Marriott timesharing resorts or for intervals at certain timesharing resorts not otherwise sponsored by Marriott through a third-party exchange company.
Owners can also trade their unused interval for points in the Marriott Rewards

®

frequent stay program, enabling them to stay at over 3,100 company-operated or franchised properties
worldwide. We typically open our interval and fractional ownership projects over time with limited inventory available at any one time.

We
also sell residential real estate in conjunction with luxury hotel development (Ritz-Carlton-Residential) and Timeshare segment projects (Ritz-Carlton Club-Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential) and receive branding fees for sales
of such branded residential real estate by others. Residences developed in conjunction with hotels are typically constructed and sold by hotel owners with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. We typically open our Timeshare segment
residential projects over time with limited inventory available at any one time. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and
the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive.

Seasonality

In general, business at company-operated and franchised properties is relatively stable and includes only moderate seasonal fluctuations. Business at some
resort properties may be seasonal depending on location.

Relationship with Major Customer

We operate a number of properties under long-term management agreements that are owned or leased by Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.
(“Host”). In addition, Host is a partner in several partnerships that own properties operated by us under long-term management agreements. See Footnote No. 24, “Relationship with Major Customer,” in the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for more information.

Descriptions of Our Brands

North American Full-Service Segment, North American Limited-Service Segment,

and International
Segment Lodging Products

Marriott Hotels & Resorts

is our global flagship brand, primarily serving business and
leisure upper-upscale travelers and meeting groups. Marriott properties are located in downtown, urban, and suburban areas, near airports, and at resort locations. Marriott inspires your best performance during travel, engineering an experience with
the services and human touches that help you achieve and recharge.

Typically, properties contain 300 to 700 well-appointed rooms, the
Revive bedding package, in-room high-speed Internet access, swimming pools, convention and banquet facilities, destination-driven restaurant and lounges, room service, concierge lounges, wireless Internet access in public places, and parking
facilities. Eighteen properties have over 1,000 rooms. Many resort properties have additional recreational facilities, such as tennis courts, golf courses, additional restaurants and lounges, and many have spa facilities. New and renovated
properties typically reflect the Great Room, a reinvented lobby featuring functional seating, state-of-the-art technology, and innovative food and beverage concepts in a stylish setting, as well as the new Marriott guest room, which features
contemporary residential design, warm colors, rich woods and architectural detail, flat-screen high-definition televisions, “plug and play” technology, and bathrooms reflecting spa-like luxury. At year-end 2008, there were 478 Marriott
Hotels & Resorts properties (172,601 rooms), excluding JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts and Marriott Conference Centers.

At
year-end 2008, there were 11

Marriott Conference Centers

(3,133 rooms) throughout the United States. Some of the centers are used exclusively by employees of sponsoring organizations, while others are marketed to outside meeting groups
and individuals. In addition to the features found in a typical Marriott full-service property, the centers typically include expanded meeting room space, banquet and dining facilities, and recreational facilities.

JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts

is the Marriott brand’s collection of luxurious properties and resorts that cater to
accomplished, discerning travelers seeking an elegant environment and personal service. At year-end 2008, there were 42 properties (17,496 rooms) primarily located in gateway cities and upscale locations throughout the world. JW Marriott Resorts
offer attentive service and exceptional amenities, many with world-class golf and spa facilities. In addition to the features found in a typical Marriott full-service property, the facilities and amenities at JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts
properties normally include larger guest rooms, higher end décor and furnishings, upgraded in-room amenities, upgraded concierge lounges, business centers and fitness centers, and 24-hour room service.

Renaissance Hotels & Resorts

is a distinctive, global,
full-service brand that targets business and leisure travelers seeking to expand their horizons and live life to the fullest.

Renaissance Hotels & Resorts properties are generally located at downtown locations in major cities, in suburban office parks, near major gateway airports, and in destination resorts. Renaissance hotels echo and embrace their
locales-from exquisite, historic castles, to meticulously modern skyscrapers. Most properties contain from 300 to 500 rooms, featuring indigenous and intriguing design elements, distinctive restaurants and lounges, unique in-room dining options,
state-of-the-art technology, and inspiring meeting and banquet facilities. At year-end 2008, there were 141 Renaissance Hotels & Resorts properties (49,389 rooms), including two Renaissance ClubSport properties (349 rooms).



Courtyard

is our upper-moderate price select-service hotel product aimed primarily
at transient business travel. Courtyard hotels maintain a residential atmosphere and typically contain 90 to 150 rooms in suburban locales and 140 to 340 rooms in downtown domestic and international locales. Well-landscaped grounds typically include
a courtyard with a pool and social areas. Hotels feature functionally designed quality guest rooms and meeting rooms, free in-room high-speed Internet access, free wireless high-speed Internet access (Wi-Fi) in the lobby (in North America), a
swimming pool, an exercise room, and

The Market

(a self-serve food store open 24 hours a day). While many hotels currently offer a breakfast buffet, the brand is in the early phases of a transition to a new state-of-the-art lobby design that
offers appealing food and beverage offerings for breakfast and dinner, increased technology and media focus, flexible seating and lighting, and enhanced service offerings. The new lobby environment provides multifunctional space with a variety of
options that allow guests to work or relax at their own pace. We believe that the transition to the new lobby design will keep Courtyard well positioned against its competition, providing better value through superior facilities and guest service.
At year-end 2008, there were 808 Courtyards (117,258 rooms) operating in 29 countries and territories.

We operate 13 systemwide hotel reservation centers, eight in the United States and Canada and five in other countries and territories, which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide, including
franchised properties. We own one of the U.S. facilities and lease the others.

We
focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy.” Our Look No Further

®

Best Rate Guarantee gives customers access to the same rates
whether they book through our telephone reservation system, our Web site or any other Marriott reservation channel. Also key to our success is our strong Marriott Rewards loyalty program, and our information-rich and easy-to-use www.Marriott.com Web
site. Our reservation system manages and controls inventory availability and pricing set by our hotels, and allows us to utilize online and offline agents where cost effective. With almost 3,200 hotels, economies of scale enable us to minimize costs
per occupied room, drive profits for our owners, and maximize our fee revenue.

In late 2007, we rolled out Sales Force One, a sales
deployment strategy that aligns sales efforts around customer needs. We believe that this strategy will reduce duplication of sales efforts and enable coverage for a larger number of accounts. To support this strategy, we have begun realigning our
sales organization to provide a primary point of contact for group, business transient, extended stay, and catering customers. The realigned sales organization will be known as Global Sales, which will be made up of four components: Enterprise
Sales, which is responsible for setting overall segment strategies and account-specific strategies for large corporate and association customers; Area Sales, assigned to a designated geographical area, and which is responsible for proactively
selling a cross-brand portfolio; Property Sales, which is responsible for booking group and catering business that falls outside Sales Office parameters; and The Sales Office, which is responsible for evaluating and closing inbound leads, developing
new business and executing event planning for select service and extended stay hotels.

Our Architecture and Construction
(“A&C”) division provides design, development, construction, refurbishment, and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or
franchise contracts. Similar to third-party contractors, A&C provides these services for owners and franchisees of Marriott-branded properties on a fee basis.

Competition

We encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor. We
believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands, we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising. There are approximately 815 lodging
management companies in the United States, including several that operate more than 100 properties. These operators are primarily private management firms, but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also
franchise their brands. Our management contracts are typically long-term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met.

In the current economic environment, faced with softening demand, we have taken steps to reduce operating costs. Due to the competitive nature of our
industry, we have focused these efforts on areas that have limited or no impact on the guest experience. While additional reductions may become necessary to preserve operating margins, we



would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty, owner preference, and associate satisfaction, to help maintain
or increase our market share.

Affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the U.S. lodging industry. In 2008,
approximately 68 percent of U.S. hotel rooms were brand-affiliated. Most of the branded properties are franchises, under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system. The franchising business is
fairly concentrated, with the six largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all U.S. rooms.

Outside the United States, branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators, although branding is more common for new hotel development. We believe that chain affiliation will increase in
overseas markets as local economies grow, trade barriers are reduced, international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs.

Based on lodging industry data, we have a 9 percent share of the U.S. hotel market (based on number of rooms) and we estimate less than a 1 percent share
of the lodging market outside the United States. We believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and Revenue per Available
Room (“RevPAR”) than direct competitors in most market areas. We attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference. We believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities,
our marketing programs, our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands.

Properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness. Most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds, generally a fixed percentage of revenue, for
periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings. These ongoing refurbishment programs, along with periodic brand initiatives, are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and
timeshare properties. Competitor hotels converting to one of Marriott’s brands typically complete renovations in conjunction with the conversion.

The vacation ownership industry is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies. Since entering the timeshare industry in 1984, we have become a recognized leader in
vacation ownership worldwide. Competition in the timeshare interval, fractional, and residential business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts, trust in the brand, the pricing of product offerings, and the availability
of program benefits, such as exchange programs. We believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences, combined with our financial strength, diverse market presence, strong brands, and well-maintained properties, will enable us to
remain competitive. Approximately 53 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners.

Marriott Rewards is a frequent guest program with over 30 million members and nine participating Marriott brands. The Marriott Rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points
toward free hotel stays and other rewards, or airline miles with any of 32 participating airline programs. We believe that Marriott Rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels and allows the company to
tailor promotional offerings to guest needs and interests. In 2008, approximately 50 percent of our room nights were purchased by Marriott Rewards members. In addition, the ability of timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into Marriott
Rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brands. Effective January 15, 2009, the Marriott Rewards program eliminated blackout dates at nearly 2,900 hotels worldwide, giving Marriott Rewards members greater access to
redemption nights at the Company’s brands.

In the recent difficult economic climate, Marriott has rolled out aggressive new marketing
programs to drive demand, leveraging Marriott Rewards and

Discontinued Operations

Synthetic Fuel

Our synthetic fuel operation consisted
of four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities (the “Facilities”). Because tax credits under Section 45K of the IRC are not available for the production and sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar year-end
2007, we shut down the Facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel in late 2007. Accordingly, we now report this business segment as a discontinued operation. Contemporaneously with the shutdown, we transferred the Facilities to
the lessors of the sites where the Facilities were located in exchange for the release of our obligations under the leases to restore the premises to their original conditions. The book value of the Facilities was zero at year-end 2007, as a result
of the Facilities being transferred to the lessors. Costs associated with shutting down the synthetic fuel operation and transferring the Facilities to the site lessors were not material.



Employee Relations

At year-end 2008, we had approximately 146,000 employees, approximately 8,300 of which were represented by labor unions. We believe relations with our employees are positive.

Environmental Compliance

Our compliance with laws
and regulations relating to environmental protection and discharge of hazardous materials has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not anticipate any material impact from such compliance
in the future.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Forward-Looking Statements

We make forward-looking statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this
report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations, which follow under the headings
“Business and Overview,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and other statements throughout this report preceded by, followed by or that include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“intends,” “plans,” “estimates” or similar expressions.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number
of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe from time to time in our
periodic filings with the SEC. We therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise
any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Risks and Uncertainties

We are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on the Company and its financial condition. You should understand that these risks could
cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained in this report and in other Company communications. Because there is no way to determine in advance whether, or to what extent, any present uncertainty
will ultimately impact our business, you should give equal weight to each of the following:

Lodging Industry Risks

The lodging industry is highly competitive, which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel and timeshare properties for
customers.

We generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors. Each of our hotel and timeshare brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets. Our
ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others. If we are unable to
compete successfully in these areas, this could limit our operating margins, diminish our market share, and reduce our earnings.

We are
subject to the range of operating risks common to the hotel, timeshare, and corporate apartment industries.

The profitability of the hotels, vacation timeshare resorts, and corporate apartments that we operate or franchise may be adversely
affected by a number of factors, including:

(1)

the availability of and demand for hotel rooms, timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products, and apartments;

(2)

international, national, and regional economic and geopolitical conditions;

(3)

the impact of war, actual or threatened terrorist activity and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to war, terrorist activity or threats;

(4)

the desirability of particular locations and changes in travel patterns;

(5)

travelers’ fears of exposure to contagious diseases, such as Avian Flu and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (“SARS”);

(6)

the occurrence of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes;

(7)

taxes and government regulations that influence or determine wages, prices, interest rates, construction procedures, and costs;

(8)

the costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including, among others, franchising, timeshare, lending, privacy, marketing
and sales, licensing, labor, employment, immigration and environmental laws, and regulations applicable under the Office of Foreign Asset Control and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

(9)

the availability and cost of capital to allow us and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners to fund investments;

(10)

regional and national development of competing properties;



(11)

increases in wages and other labor costs, energy, healthcare, insurance, transportation and fuel, and other expenses central to the conduct of our business or the cost of travel for
our customers, including recent increases in energy costs and any resulting increase in travel costs or decrease in airline capacity;

(12)

organized labor activities, which could cause the diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations, loss of group business, and/or increased labor costs; and

(13)

foreign currency exchange fluctuations.

Any one or more
of these factors could limit or reduce the demand or the prices our hotels are able to obtain for hotel rooms, timeshare units, residential units, and corporate apartments or could increase our costs and therefore reduce the profit of our lodging
businesses. Reduced demand for hotels could also give rise to losses under loans, guarantees, and minority equity investments that we have made in connection with hotels that we manage. Even where such factors do not reduce demand, property-level
profit margins may suffer if we are unable to fully recover increased operating costs from our guests. Similarly, our fee revenue could be impacted by weak property-level revenue or profitability.

Our hotel management and franchise agreements may also be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances, such as the bankruptcy of a hotel
owner or franchisee, or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section, which the Company fails or elects not to cure. A significant loss of agreements due
to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business.

The current general economic
recession and the slowdown in the lodging and timeshare industries will continue to impact our financial results and growth.

The present economic recession and the uncertainty over its depth and duration will continue to have a negative impact
on the lodging and timeshare industries. There is now general consensus among economists that the economies of the U.S., Europe and much of the rest of the world are now in a recession, and we are experiencing reduced demand for our hotel rooms and
timeshare products. Accordingly, our financial results have been impacted by the economic slowdown and we expect that our future financial results and growth will be further harmed while the recession continues.

Operational Risks

Our lodging
operations are subject to international, national, and regional conditions.

Because we conduct our business on a national and international platform, our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of regional and global economies.
In recent years, our business has been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from recent economic conditions, the military action in Iraq, and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism. Our
future economic performance is similarly subject to the economic environment in the United States and other regions, which has become increasingly uncertain with recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies, the
current worldwide recession, the resulting unknown pace of business travel, and the occurrence of any future incidents in the countries where we operate.

New branded hotel products that we launch in the future may not be successful.

We may in the future launch additional branded hotel products. We cannot assure that these brands will be accepted by hotel owners,
potential franchisees, or the traveling public, that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing the brands, or that the brands will be successful. In addition, each of these new brands involves cooperation and/or consultation with a third
party, including some shared control over product design and development, sales and marketing, and brand standards. Disagreements with these third parties regarding areas of consultation or shared control could slow the development of these new
brands and/or impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands.

Risks
relating to natural disasters, contagious disease, terrorist activity, and war could reduce the demand for lodging, which may adversely affect our revenues.

So called “Acts of God,” such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural
disasters and the spread of contagious diseases, such as Avian Flu and SARS, in locations where we own, manage or franchise significant properties, and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers can cause a decline in the
level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging. Actual or threatened war, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, and other geopolitical uncertainty can have a similar effect. Any one or more of these events may
reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms, timeshare units, and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we are able to obtain for them, both of which could adversely affect our profits.

We may have disputes with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise.

Consistent with our focus on management and franchising, we own
very few of our lodging properties. The nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both



management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and may give rise to disagreements in some instances. Such disagreements may be more
likely as hotel returns are depressed as a result of the current economic recession. We seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but have
not always been able to do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements has in the past resulted in litigation, and could do so in the future.

Damage to, or other potential losses involving, properties that we own, manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance.

We have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits
that we believe are customary. Market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of insurance coverage that we can obtain and our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic
nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, or terrorist acts, may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. As a result, we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in
coverage levels. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in
certain losses being totally uninsured. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for guarantees, debt, or other
financial obligations related to the property.

Development and Financing Risks

While

w

e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, we depend on capital to buy, develop and improve hotels and to develop
timeshare properties, and we or our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary.

In order to fund new hotel investments, as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels, both the Company and current and potential hotel owners
must periodically spend money. The availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control. Events over the past several
months, including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies and the contraction of available liquidity and leverage have impaired the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments. As a result, many
current and prospective hotel owners are finding hotel financing on commercially viable terms to be difficult or impossible to obtain. In addition, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the financial condition of other lenders has prevented some
projects that are in construction or development, including a few in which the Company has minority equity investments, from drawing on existing financing commitments, and replacement financing may not be available or may only be available on less
favorable terms. Delays, increased costs and other impediments to restructuring such projects will reduce our ability to realize fees, recover loans and guarantee advances, or realize equity investments from such projects. Our ability to recover
loan and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from owners through the proceeds of hotel sales, refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital. In addition, any future downgrade of our credit
ratings by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service or other rating agencies could reduce our availability of capital and increase our cost of capital.

Continued or increased volatility in the credit markets will likely continue to impair our ability to sell the loans that our Timeshare business
generates.

Our Timeshare business provides financing to purchasers of our timeshare and fractional properties, and we periodically sell interests in those loans in the securities markets. Recent declines in the credit markets will likely
continue to impair the timing and volume of the timeshare loans that we sell. Market conditions during the first half of 2008 resulted in terms that were less favorable to us than they were historically, and further deterioration prevented a planned
fourth quarter 2008 sale, may delay planned 2009 sales or sharply increase their cost to us until the markets stabilize, or prevent us from selling our timeshare notes entirely. Although we expect to realize the economic value of our timeshare note
portfolio even if future note sales are temporarily or indefinitely delayed, such delays in note sales could reduce or postpone future gains, cause us to reduce spending in order to maintain our leverage and return targets, and could also result in
increased borrowing to provide capital to replace proceeds from such sales.

Our growth strategy depends upon third-party
owners/operators, and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable.

Our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property
owners. The terms of our management agreements, franchise agreements, and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors, among other things. We cannot assure you that any of our current
arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations, renew agreements, or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today.

Our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments.

Our ability to
sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised Marriott brands is affected, and may potentially be limited, by a variety of factors influencing
real estate development generally. These include site



availability, financing, planning, zoning and other local approvals, and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors, such as
projected room occupancy, changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply, territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements, costs of construction, and anticipated room rate structure.

Our development activities expose us to project cost, completion, and resale risks.

We develop new hotel, timeshare interval, fractional
ownership, and residential properties, both directly and through partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures with third parties. Our involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks, including that:
(1) recent and continued declines in the capital markets may limit our ability, or that of third parties with whom we do business, to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or development of future properties;
(2) properties that we develop could become less attractive due to increases in mortgage rates and/or decreases in mortgage availability, market absorption or oversupply, with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a
profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate; (3) construction delays, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or so called “Acts of God” such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or fires may increase overall project costs
or result in project cancellations; and (4) we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for projects that are not pursued to completion.

Development activities that involve our co-investment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs, impair project operations, or increase project completion risks.

Partnerships,
joint ventures, and other business structures involving our co-investment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks, including the possibility that other
investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations, or could have or develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. Although we actively seek to
minimize such risks before investing in partnerships, joint ventures or similar structures, actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay, increased project costs, or operational difficulties following project completion.
Such disputes may also be more likely in the current difficult investment environment.

Risks associated with development and sale of
residential properties that are associated with our lodging and timeshare properties or brands may reduce our profits.

In certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate, through minority interests and/or licensing fees, in the development
and sale of residential properties associated with our brands, including luxury residences, and condominiums under our Ritz-Carlton and Marriott brands. Such projects pose additional risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging and
timeshare businesses, which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity, including the following:

•

Recent decreases in residential real estate, vacation home prices, and demand generally, will reduce our profits and could even result in losses on residential
sales, increase our carrying costs due to a slower pace of sales than we anticipated, and could make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands;

•

Increases in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability, or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying
residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay; and

•

Residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims, and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant.

Technology, Information Protection, and Privacy Risks

A failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.

The lodging and timeshare industries continue to demand the use of sophisticated technology and
systems, including those used for our reservation, revenue management and property management systems, our Marriott Rewards program, and technologies we make available to our guests. These technologies and systems must be refined, updated, and/or
replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis. If we are unable to do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new
technology or system, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.

An increase in the use of third-party Internet services to book online hotel reservations could
adversely impact our revenues

. Some of our hotel rooms are booked through Internet travel intermediaries, such as Expedia.com

®

, Travelocity.com

®

, and Orbitz.com

®

, as well as lesser-known online travel service providers. These intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel, but now also provide
offerings for corporate travel and group meetings. Although Marriott’s Look No Further

®

Best Rate Guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published
rates at our hotels, intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers, including the purchase, by certain companies, of trademarked online keywords such as “Marriott”



from Internet search engines such as Google

®

and Yahoo

®

to steer customers toward their Web sites (a practice currently being challenged by various trademark owners in federal court). Although Marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key
online intermediaries, the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ Web sites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely. Our business and profitability could be harmed if online
intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services, diverting bookings away from Marriott.com, or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels.

Failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions, damage of reputation and/or
subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.

Our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers as they are
entered into, processed by, summarized by, and reported by our various information systems and those of our service providers. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of that customer,
employee, and company data is critical to us. If that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions. Our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the
regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, both in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data
could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines and litigation.

Changes in privacy law
could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.

Our Timeshare segment and, to a lesser extent, our other lodging segments, rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email marketing, and
postal mailings. Any further restrictions in laws such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, CANSPAM Act, and various U.S. state laws, or new federal laws, regarding marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these
activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing, email, and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative
marketing strategies, which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of timeshare units and other products. We also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial
relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials. If access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new
customers, and introduce them to our products could be impaired.

Other Risks

If we cannot attract and retain talented associates, our business could suffer.

We compete with other companies both within and outside of our
industry for talented personnel. If we are not able to recruit, train, develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency or internal
control failures. Insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses.

Delaware
law and our governing corporate documents contain, and our board of directors could implement, anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts.

Under the Delaware business combination statute, a stockholder holding 15 percent or more
of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director’s consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock. Our governing corporate documents also, among
other things, require supermajority votes in connection with mergers and similar transactions. In addition, our board of directors could, without stockholder approval, implement other anti-takeover defenses, such as a stockholder rights plan to
replace the stockholder’s rights plan that expired in March 2008.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2.

Properties.

Company-operated properties are
described in Part I, Item 1., “Business,” earlier in this report. We believe our properties are in generally good physical condition with the need for only routine repairs and maintenance and periodic capital improvements. Most of our
regional offices and reservation centers, both domestically and internationally, are located in leased facilities. We also lease space in six office buildings with combined space of approximately 1.3 million square feet in Maryland and Florida
where our corporate, Ritz-Carlton, and Marriott Vacation Club International headquarters are located.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

From time
to time, we are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including adjustments proposed during governmental examinations of the various tax returns we file. We currently are not aware of any legal
proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matters were submitted to a vote of shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

Market Information and Dividends

The range of prices
of our common stock and dividends declared per share for each quarterly period within the last two years are as follows:

At January 30, 2009, there were 349,860,166 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding
held by 46,504 shareholders of record. Our Class A Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange. The fiscal year-end closing price for our stock was $20.06 on January 2, 2009, and $34.12 on
December 28, 2007. All prices are reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system.

Fourth Quarter 2008 Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities

On August 2, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors increased, by 40 million shares, the authorization to
repurchase our Class A Common Stock for a total outstanding authorization of approximately 51 million shares on that date. We repurchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. We did not repurchase any shares
during the 2008 fourth quarter. As of year-end 2008, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under our authorization was 21.3 million.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW

We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,178 properties (560,681 rooms)
and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2008 and include 27 home and condominium projects (2,482 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,332 furnished
corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals.

Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North
American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under 18 separate brand names in 66 countries and territories.

We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of
hotels we own or lease. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and
residential properties; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate.

We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under The Ritz-Carlton brand
(Ritz-Carlton-Residential), and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (Ritz-Carlton Club-Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited
inventory available at any one time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third-party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of
our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive.

The economic recession, the global credit crisis and eroded consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2008. U.S. lodging
demand declined throughout 2008, but especially in the fourth quarter, as a result of slowing economic growth. Outside the United States, international lodging demand was generally stronger in most markets than in the United States, but also
softened progressively throughout 2008 and declined markedly in the 2008 fourth quarter. Leisure transient demand in the United States weakened in the first quarter of 2008 and was joined by weakening business transient demand beginning in the
second quarter of 2008. Additionally, demand associated with our luxury properties decreased dramatically in the 2008 fourth quarter. These factors were compounded in several markets in the United States where the supply of hotel rooms increased.
Last minute new group meeting demand and attendance at group meetings softened considerably throughout 2008 as well, and group meeting cancellations increased significantly in the fourth quarter. While some business customers increased room nights
in 2008, including professional services firms, defense contractors, and insurance companies, others declined, including companies associated with the financial services, automotive, and telecommunications industries. In general, for the properties
in our system, international, and full-service properties experienced stronger demand worldwide than our limited-service and luxury properties.

U.S. demand for timeshare intervals also softened considerably in 2008, and especially in the fourth quarter, reflecting weak consumer confidence and a very difficult financing environment, while demand in Latin America and Asia for
timeshare products was stronger compared to 2007. Demand for Ritz-Carlton fractional and residential units was particularly weak. Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage-of-completion accounting
method, soft demand is frequently not reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. Intentional and unintentional construction delays could also unfavorably impact nearer-term Timeshare segment results as
percentage-of-completion revenue recognition may correspondingly be delayed as well.

Responding to the challenging demand environment in
2008 for hotel rooms, we initiated a range of new sales promotions with a focus on leisure and group business opportunities to increase property-level revenue. These promotions were designed to keep current customers loyal while also attracting new
guests. In response to increased hesitancy to finalize group bookings, we have also implemented sales associate and customer incentives to close on business. As more customers use social media, we have also found new ways to connect, communicating
with more than 300,000 of our customers on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and through our blog “Marriott on the Move.” We also continue to enhance our Marriott Rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically market to this large and growing
customer base.



Given this slower demand environment, we worked aggressively to reduce costs and enhance property-level
house profit margins by modifying menus and restaurant hours, reviewing and adjusting room amenities, and not filling some vacant positions. While varying by property, most properties in our system have instituted contingency plans with very tight
cost controls. We have also reduced the above-property costs by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas that are allocated to the hotels. We have also eliminated certain positions, not filled some vacant positions, and will encourage,
and where legally permitted, require employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. Additionally, we canceled certain hotel development projects. For our Timeshare segment, we have slowed or canceled some development
projects, closed less efficient timeshare sales offices and increased marketing efforts and purchase incentives. For additional information on our companywide restructuring efforts, see our “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” caption
later in this section.

Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year-end 2008, 48
percent of the hotel rooms in our system were operated under management agreements, 50 percent were operated under franchise agreements, and 2 percent were owned or leased by us. Our emphasis on property management and franchising tends to provide
more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while continued unit expansion, reflecting properties added to our system, generates ongoing growth. With long-term management and franchise agreements, this strategy has allowed substantial
growth while reducing leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. Additionally, by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling those investments we do make, we increase our financial flexibility.

We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. RevPAR may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. References to RevPAR throughout this report
are in constant dollars unless otherwise noted.

For our North American comparable properties, RevPAR decreased in 2008, compared to the
year-ago period, with moderately greater strength in Manhattan, New York, Houston, Texas, Orlando, Florida, and Los Angeles, California and weaker RevPAR in suburban markets near, among other areas, Orange County, California, Chicago, Illinois, and
Detroit, Michigan. Outside North America, 2008 RevPAR increases versus the prior year period were stronger, particularly in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, South America, and Central Europe.

Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue.
We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which
we have the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative,
and sales and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.

Compared to 2007, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins for 2008 decreased by 70 basis points reflecting the impact of stronger
year-over-year RevPAR associated with international properties and very strong cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system. This impact was more than offset by the impact of RevPAR declines year-over-year associated with properties in
North America reflecting weaker demand and higher expenses in 2008 in North America primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest December 31 and while the 2006 and
2007 fiscal years included 52 weeks, the 2008 fiscal year included 53 weeks. As the 53

rd

week for 2008 included the New Year’s holiday and was
seasonally slow, it had the effect of reducing year-over-year RevPAR performance. While worldwide comparable RevPAR for 2008 for company-operated properties decreased 1.1 percent compared to 2007, worldwide comparable RevPAR for 2008 for
company-operated properties excluding the extra 53

rd

week decreased 0.4 percent compared to 2007.

Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2008, 2007, and 2006.

Continuing Operations

Revenues

2008 Compared to 2007

Revenues decreased by $111
million (1 percent) to $12,879 million in 2008 from $12,990 million in 2007, primarily as a result of lower Timeshare sales and service revenue and lower incentive management fees, partially offset by the impact of unit growth across the system.
Base management and franchise fees increased by $27 million as a result of improved RevPAR in international markets and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of declines in North American RevPAR. The $27 million increase in combined base
management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Incentive management fees
decreased by $58 million primarily reflecting the recognition in the 2007 period of: (1) incentive management fees totaling $17 million that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007; and
(2) $13 million of incentive management fees from business interruption proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property-level profitability due to lower occupancy and higher
property-level wages and benefits costs and utilities costs, particularly in North America. Partially offsetting the decreases, incentive management fees from international properties increased, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. See the
“BUSINESS SEGMENTS” discussion later in this report for additional information.

The $15 million (1 percent) decrease in owned,
leased, corporate housing, and other revenue largely reflected $10 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and the
receipt in 2008 of $15 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees, compared to $19 million in 2007 and flat branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and sale of branded residential real estate (totaling
$64 million in both 2008 and 2007), partially offset by $17 million of higher corporate housing revenue. The $10 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected the conversion of owned hotels to managed hotels.

Timeshare sales and services revenue in 2008 decreased by $324 million (19 percent) compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflected lower
demand in 2008, revenue recognition of contract sales for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, and lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, as well as a decrease of $65 million in note
sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these decreases in revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, increased interest income, revenue associated with
projects that became reportable subsequent to 2007, and increased services revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment.

The $111 million decrease in total revenue includes $259 million (3 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue to $8,834 million in 2008 from
$8,575 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost
reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to sales growth and the growth
in the number of properties we manage. We added six managed properties (3,100 rooms) and 157 franchised properties (19,836 rooms) to our system in 2008, net of properties exiting the system.

2007 Compared to 2006

Revenues increased by $995
million (8 percent) to $12,990 million in 2007 from $11,995 million in 2006, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide. Base management and franchise fees
increased by $116 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth, as we opened 203 properties (29,200 rooms) throughout 2007. In 2006, we recognized



$5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in
2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million
for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base
management fees for 2007 included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Stronger catering, food and
beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases.

Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $170 million (11 percent) in 2007 over the prior year. The increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition
thresholds. In 2006, some projects were in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007. The increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS:
Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment.

Owned, leased, corporate housing and other
revenue increased by $121 million (11 percent). The increase largely reflected stronger RevPAR and the mix of owned and leased properties in 2007, compared to 2006, and to a lesser extent, higher branding fees associated with both affinity card
endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in 2007 and $52 million in 2006), offset by the recognition of $19 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees in 2007, compared to the
recognition of $26 million of such fees in 2006.

The $995 million increase in total revenue includes $500 million (6 percent) of increased
cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,575 million in 2007 from $8,075 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to wage increases, sales growth, and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added
15 managed properties (4,870 rooms) and 138 franchised properties (15,963 rooms) to our system in 2007, net of properties exiting the system.

Restructuring Costs and Other Charges

During the latter part of 2008, we experienced a significant decline in demand for
hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result, in part, of the recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our
capital-intensive Timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and, particularly the significant deterioration in the credit markets, which resulted in our decision not to complete a
note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008. These declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. We responded by
implementing certain companywide cost-saving measures, with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further cost-saving measures. Upper-level management responsible for the Timeshare segment, hotel operations, development,
and above-property level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives. The various initiatives resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of $55 million that we recorded
in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also incurred other charges, including charges for guarantees and reserves for loan losses, and inventory write-downs on Timeshare inventory, reserves on accounts receivable, contract cancellation allowances, a
charge related to the valuation of Timeshare residual interests, a charge associated with hedge ineffectiveness related to Timeshare note sale hedges, and asset impairments and other charges, detailed further in “Other Charges.”

As part of the restructuring efforts in our Timeshare segment, we reduced and consolidated sales channels in the United States and closed
down certain operations in Europe. We recorded Timeshare restructuring costs of $28 million in the 2008 fourth quarter, including: (1) $14 million in severance costs; (2) $5 million in facilities exit costs, primarily associated with
noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income arising from the reduction in personnel; and (3) $9 million related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. We expect to
complete this restructuring by year-end 2009. We are projecting $55 million to $65 million ($35 million to $42 million after-tax) of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring. These savings will likely be reflected in
the “Timeshare-direct” and the “General, administrative, and other expenses” captions in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

As part of the hotel development restructuring efforts across several of our Lodging segments, we discontinued certain development projects that required our investment. We recorded restructuring costs in the 2008 fourth quarter of $24
million, including: (1) $2 million in severance costs; and (2) $22 million related to the write-off of



capitalized costs relating to development projects that we discontinued, including capitalized costs related to owned development of Renaissance ClubSport.
We expect to complete this restructuring by year-end 2009. We are projecting up to $6 million ($4 million after-tax) of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring. These savings will likely be reflected in the
“General, administrative, and other expenses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We also implemented
restructuring initiatives by reducing above-property level lodging management personnel and corporate overhead. We incurred 2008 fourth quarter restructuring costs of $3 million primarily reflecting severance costs. We expect to complete this
restructuring by year-end 2009. We are projecting up to $4 million ($3 million after-tax) of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring. These savings will likely be reflected in the “General, administrative, and
other expenses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We have provided detailed information related to these
restructuring costs and other charges below.

Restructuring Costs

Severance

These various restructuring
initiatives resulted in an overall reduction of 1,021 employees (the majority of whom were terminated by January 2, 2009) across the Company. We recorded a total workforce reduction charge of $19 million related primarily to severance and
fringe benefits, which consisted of $14 million for the Timeshare segment, $2 million related to hotel development, and $3 million related to above-property level lodging management and corporate overhead. The charge does not reflect amounts billed
out separately to owners for property-level severance costs. We also delayed filling vacant positions and reduced staff hours. In connection with these initiatives, we expect to incur an additional $3 million to $4 million related to severance and
fringe benefits in 2009 for the Timeshare segment.

Facilities Exit Costs

As a result of workforce reductions and delays in filling vacant positions that were part of the Timeshare segment restructuring, we ceased using certain
leased facilities. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $5 million associated with these facilities, primarily related to noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income. In connection with these initiatives, in 2009,
we expect to incur an additional $2 million to $3 million related to ceasing use of additional noncancelable leases.

Development
Cancellations

We sometimes incur certain costs associated with the development of hotel and timeshare properties, including legal
costs, the cost of land, and planning and design costs. We capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed. As a result of the sharp downturn in the economy, we decided to discontinue
certain development projects that required our investment, including our Renaissance ClubSport real estate development activities. These cancellations do not impact the two Renaissance ClubSport properties that are currently open. As a result of
these development cancellations, we expensed $31 million of previously capitalized costs, which consisted of $9 million of costs for the Timeshare segment and $22 million of costs related to hotel development. We do not currently expect to expense
any additional capitalized costs in 2009 in connection with these restructuring initiatives.

Other Charges

Charges for Guarantees and Reserves for Loan Losses

We sometimes issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with some financing transactions and other obligations. We also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage. As a result of
the downturn in the economy, certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners may not be able to meet debt service obligations to us or, in some cases, to third-party lending institutions. In addition, we expect
profit levels at a few hotels to drop below guaranteed levels. As a result, based on cash flow projections, we expect to fund under some of our guarantees, which we do not deem recoverable, and we expect that one of the loans made by us will not be
repaid according to its original terms. Due to the expected fundings under guarantees that we deemed nonrecoverable, we recorded charges of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the “General, administrative, and other expenses”
caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Due to the expected loan loss, we recorded a charge of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the “Provision for loan losses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.



Timeshare Inventory Write-downs

As a result of terminating certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, we recorded an inventory write-down of $9 million in the fourth quarter of
2008. We recorded this charge in the “Timeshare-direct” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Accounts
Receivable-Bad Debts

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reserved $4 million of accounts receivable, which we deemed uncollectible,
generally as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating environment, following an analysis of those accounts. We recorded this charge in the “General, administrative, and other expenses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Timeshare Contract Cancellation Allowances

Our financial statements reflect net contract cancellation allowances totaling $12 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue and cost previously recorded for
certain projects under the percentage-of-completion method will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing. We have an equity method investment in one of these projects, and reflected $7 million of the $12 million in the
“Equity in earnings” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining net $5 million of contract cancellation allowances consisted of a reduction in revenue, net of adjustments to product costs and other direct costs, and
was recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue, net of direct costs.

Timeshare Residual Interests Valuation

The fair market value of our residual interest in timeshare notes sold declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to an increase in the market
rate of interest at which we discount future cash flows to estimate the fair market value of the retained interests. The increase in the market rate of interest reflects deteriorating economic conditions and disruption in the credit markets, which
significantly increased the borrowing costs to issuers. As a result of this change, we recorded a $32 million charge in the “Timeshare sales and services” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income to reflect the decrease in the fair
value of these residual interests.

Timeshare Hedge Ineffectiveness

Given the significant deterioration in the credit markets, we expect that any potential note sale transactions pursued by the Company in the near term
will be materially different from arrangements originally contemplated, and accordingly the sensitivity of a hedge the Company previously entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted note sales no longer significantly
corresponds to the sensitivity in expected note sale proceeds. Differences include expected legal structures, modifications to priority of cash flow, and higher costs. The change in terms (inputs) used to determine hedge effectiveness for
Timeshare’s note sale hedges resulted in the recognition of $12 million in hedge ineffectiveness. We recorded this hedge ineffectiveness as a reduction in note sale gains in the “Timeshare sales and services” caption in our
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Asset Impairments and Other Charges

One project that is in development and in which the Company has a joint venture investment was unable to draw on existing financing commitments as a
result of the recent turmoil in the capital markets and the bankruptcy of the project’s major lender. As a result, based on our analysis of expected future cash flows, we determined that our investment in that joint venture was fully impaired,
and we recorded an impairment charge of $9 million in the “Equity in earnings” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

In addition, as a result of the economic downturn and the inability of certain developers to obtain financing, we also recorded write-offs of other assets ($12 million) related to development costs associated with projects we no longer deem
probable in the “General, administrative, and other expenses” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We also deemed
certain cost method tax investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired because we do not expect to receive any future economic benefit from these investments. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $9 million for those investments in
the “Gains and other income” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income.



Summary of Restructuring Costs and Other Charges

The following table is a summary of the restructuring costs and other charges we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as our remaining
liability at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 and remaining restructuring costs expected to be incurred in 2009 as part of these restructuring initiatives:

We anticipate that the remaining liability related to the workforce reduction will be
substantially paid by the end of 2009 for the Timeshare segment, by the end of 2009 for hotel development, and by the end of 2009 for above-property level management. The amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the
consolidation of facilities in the Timeshare segment will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012. The remaining liability related to expected fundings under guarantees will likely be substantially paid by year-end 2010. The following
tables provide further detail on these charges, including a breakdown by segment:

2008 Operating Income Impact



2008 Non-Operating Income Impact

The following tables provide further detail on restructuring costs we expect to incur in 2009,
including breakdown by segment:

2009 Expected Operating Income Impact

Operating Income

2008 Compared to 2007

Operating income decreased by $403 million (34 percent) to $785 million in 2008 from $1,188 million
in 2007. The decrease in operating income reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $41 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of
lower incentive management fees, $55 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, and a $15 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in combined base management and franchise fees of $27
million.

Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses for 2008 totaled $89 million. The decline of $261 million (75
percent) from the prior year primarily reflected $138 million of lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and
resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs,
primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential products, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a $22 million pretax impairment charge ($10 million net of minority interest
benefit), start-up costs and low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition thresholds, as well as lower revenue recognition for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007.
The decrease in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected lower note sale gains in 2008, compared to the prior year. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information regarding our
Timeshare segment.

The $41 million (23 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses
primarily reflected $21 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, $4 million of lower termination fees, and $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the
end of the 2007 fiscal year. Partially offsetting the decreases were lower depreciation charges totaling $6 million in 2008 associated with one property, compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2007 of $8 million associated with that same
property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used.”

General, administrative, and other expenses
increased by $15 million (2 percent) to $783 million in 2008 from $768 million in 2007. This increase reflected the following items: $44 million of increased expenses associated with, among other things, our unit growth and development, systems
improvements, and initiatives to enhance our brands globally; a $16 million charge for certain guarantees; an unfavorable $9 million variance for reserve reversals in 2007; $12 million in write-offs in 2008 of costs related to development
cancellations; $4 million of increased foreign exchange losses; and $4 million of charges related to bad debt reserves on accounts receivable. See “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other
Charges,” for additional information on the charge related to certain guarantees, development cancellation write-offs, and bad debt reserves. These unfavorable



variances were partially offset by a favorable variance related to a 2007 charge of $35 million resulting from excise taxes associated with the settlement of
issues raised during the examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and Department of Labor of our employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) feature of our Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and
Trust (the “Plan”). See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, 2008 included a $28 million favorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses, compared
to an $11 million unfavorable impact in the prior year, both of which reflected mark-to-market valuations. Of the $15 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $51 million was attributable to our Lodging
and Timeshare segments and a decrease of $36 million, reflecting the 2007 ESOP settlement charge, was unallocated.

The reasons for the
decrease of $58 million in incentive management fees as well as the combined base management and franchise fees increase of $27 million over the prior year are noted in the preceding “Revenues” section.

2007 Compared to 2006

Operating income increased by
$101 million (9 percent) to $1,188 million in 2007 from $1,087 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income reflects stronger combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees of $204 million, partially offset by
higher general, administrative, and other expenses of $91 million, lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $7 million, and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $5 million.

The combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees increase of $204 million reflected strong RevPAR growth, unit
growth, and property-level margin improvements and favorable exchange rates worldwide. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no
similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized.
Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption
insurance proceeds received in 2006.

Compared to the year-ago period, general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $91 million
(13 percent) to $768 million in 2007 from $677 million in 2006. In 2007, we incurred a $35 million charge related to excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the IRS and Department of Labor examination of our ESOP feature
of our Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the “Plan”). See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, the increase was attributable
to, among other things, increased costs related to our unit growth, development and systems improvements, increased legal expenses, and increased other administrative costs. Also unfavorably impacting general, administrative, and other expenses,
when compared to the prior year, were foreign exchange losses totaling $2 million in 2007 compared to foreign exchange gains of $6 million in 2006 and $1 million of guarantee charges in 2007 while the year-ago period reflected $6 million of
guarantee reversals. Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases were $4 million of lower hotel operating agreement performance cure payments in 2007 compared to 2006 and a $9 million reversal in 2007 of reserves that were no longer required.
Increased legal expenses in 2007 include charges associated with litigation and other legal matters. Of the $91 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $13 million was attributable to our Lodging and
Timeshare segments and a $78 million increase was unallocated.

Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million
decreased by $7 million (2 percent), compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, more than
offset by the reversal in 2006 of $15 million of contingency reserves and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that
reached reportability thresholds in 2007, offset by several other projects that were approaching sell-out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains
in 2007, compared to 2006.

The $5 million (3 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct
expenses reflected $19 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, compared to $26 million in 2006. Depreciation charges totaling $8 million were recorded in 2007 associated with one owned property that was
reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” during 2007 compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2006 of $7 million associated with two properties that were reclassified from “held for sale” to “held
and used.” Partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net



of direct expenses was the favorable impact of $4 million associated with both the stronger demand environment in 2007 and the impact of the sale and
purchase of several properties.

Gains and Other Income (Expense)

The table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006:

2008 Compared to 2007

The $28 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2008 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of our Senior Notes we repurchased. For additional information on the debt
extinguishment, see the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section later in this report. The $25 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected a $23 million gain associated with sales of real estate in our
International segment as well as other smaller gains on sale of real estate in 2007 that did not occur in 2008. The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt in 2007 was associated with government incentives noted in the “2007 Compared to
2006” section below. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint
venture investments. Income from cost method joint ventures decreased $17 million to a loss of $3 million in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to certain cost method tax investments that we deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired
(see the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information).

Compared to 2006

The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt for 2007 was associated with government incentives. The loans were
forgiven in recognition of our contribution to job growth and economic development. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we
held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $68 million in 2006 was comprised of $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of
joint venture investments and the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee, which generated a gain of $25 million. Gains on sales of real estate and other increased $13 million in 2007, and primarily reflected a $23 million gain
associated with sales of real estate by our International segment in 2007 that did not occur in 2006, partially offset by smaller gains in 2006 that did not occur in 2007.

Interest Expense

2008 Compared to 2007

Interest expense decreased by $21 million (11 percent) to $163 million in 2008 compared to $184 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense compared
to the prior year reflected a charge of $13 million for interest on the excise taxes associated with the ESOP settlement in 2007. Interest expense associated with commercial paper and our Credit Facility decreased in 2008 reflecting a reduction in
the amount of commercial paper outstanding, lower interest rates on commercial paper, and increased borrowings under the Credit Facility with a lower interest rate. As a result, year-over-year interest expense was lower by $7 million. We also
benefitted from a $15 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self-insurance programs) as a result of lower interest rates, a $6
million favorable variance to the prior year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects, and the maturity of our Series E Senior Notes in early 2008 yielding a $6 million favorable variance to the prior year. The write-off
of $2 million of deferred financing costs in 2007 related to the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement resulted in a favorable variance in 2008. These favorable variances to the prior year were partially offset by the impact of the Series I
and Series J Senior Notes issuances, which occurred in the second half of 2007 that increased our interest expense in 2008 by $30 million.



2007 Compared to 2006

Interest expense increased by $60 million (48 percent) to $184 million for 2007 from $124 million in 2006. Of the $60 million increase over 2006, $78 million was due to: $26 million of higher interest reflecting a
higher outstanding commercial paper balance, primarily due to increased share repurchases and the ESOP settlement payments, and related interest rates; $25 million of interest associated with our Series H Senior Notes issuance, which occurred late
in 2006 and our Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances, which occurred in 2007; a charge of $13 million in 2007 related to the ESOP settlement; charges totaling $53 million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to interest
on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self-insurance programs); interest totaling $5 million associated
with other additional debt; and the write-off of $2 million of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement in 2007. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the
ESOP settlement. The increase in interest on the programs we operate on behalf of the owners over the year-ago period is attributable to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting the $78 million interest expense
increases over 2006 was an $18 million favorable variance to last year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects.

Interest
Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax

2008 Compared to 2007

Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, increased by $1 million (3 percent) to $39 million from $38 million in the prior year.

The provision for loan losses increased by $3 million (18 percent) to $20 million from $17 million in the prior year. The increase reflected
provisions recorded in 2008 including a $22 million provision on a fully impaired loan (see the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information) and a $3 million loan
loss provision associated with one property. The unfavorable variance associated with the 2008 provisions was mostly offset by favorable variances associated with a $12 million provision recorded in 2007, related to one property, a $5 million
provision recorded in 2007 to write off the remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines lease, and the reversal of $5 million of provisions in 2008 related to two previously impaired loans that were repaid. For additional
information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment write-off, see the “Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption later in this report.

Our tax provision decreased by $91 million (21 percent) to $350 million in 2008 from a tax provision of $441 million in 2007 and reflected the impact associated with lower pretax income in 2008, a 2007 charge for a
German legislative tax change, and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. This decrease was partially offset by $39 million in higher deferred compensation costs in 2008 and a higher tax rate in 2008.
The higher 2008 tax rate reflected: (1) $29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction; (2) $19 million
of income tax expense due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction; and (3) $24 million of income tax
expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries that is in ongoing discussions with the IRS.

2007 Compared to

Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased by $11 million (22 percent) to $38 million in 2007 from $49
million in 2006, primarily reflecting lower interest income associated with loans that have been repaid to us, partially offset by the impact associated with new loan fundings.

Loan loss provisions increased by $20 million versus the prior year primarily reflecting a $12 million charge associated with one property and a $5
million charge to write off our remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines lease versus loan loss reversals of $3 million in 2006. For additional information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment write-off, see the
“Investment in Leveraged Lease” caption later in this report.

Our tax provision increased by $61 million (16 percent) to $441
million in 2007 from a tax provision of $380 million in 2006 and reflected higher pretax income from our Lodging and Timeshare segments as well as a higher tax rate in 2007, primarily reflecting both increased taxes associated with our international
operations and a less favorable mix of taxable earnings between countries. Increased taxes also reflect a charge for a German legislative tax change in 2007, which had a one-time impact and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional
interest on the ESOP settlement. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information on the ESOP settlement.



Equity in Earnings (Losses)

2008 Compared to 2007

Equity in earnings of $15 million in 2008 was unchanged from earnings of $15 million in 2007 and
primarily reflected $14 million of increased earnings from a joint venture, which sold portfolio assets in 2008 and had significant associated gains, $10 million of favorable variances for three joint ventures that experienced losses due to start-up
costs in the prior year, and $5 million of increased earnings from an international segment joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture in 2008, partially offset by an unfavorable $11 million impact
associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate, an impairment charge of $9 million associated with one Luxury segment joint venture under development, and a $7 million impact related to contract
cancellation allowances recorded at one Timeshare segment joint venture (see the “Other Charges” section of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information on the impairment and contract
cancellation allowances).

2007 Compared to 2006

Equity in earnings increased by $12 million to earnings of $15 million from $3 million in 2006 and reflected the mix of investments, compared to 2006, and stronger results at several joint ventures reflecting the
strong lodging demand environment in 2007, for one joint venture, the reopening of a hotel, late in 2006, in Mexico, which had been closed following a hurricane in 2005 and strong demand in 2007 for our timeshare products in Hawaii.

Minority Interest

2008 Compared to 2007

Minority interest increased by $14 million in 2008 to a $15 million benefit. The minority interest benefit of $15 million is net of tax and reflected our
partners’ share of losses totaling $24 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of $9 million associated with the losses.

Income from Continuing Operations

2008 Compared to 2007

Compared to the prior year, income from continuing operations decreased by $338 million (48 percent) to $359 million in 2008, and
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by $0.77 (44 percent) to $0.98. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “Operating Income,” the decrease versus the prior year was due to lower
Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($261 million), lower gains and other income ($59 million), lower incentive management fees ($58 million), restructuring costs recorded in 2008 ($55 million), lower owned, leased, corporate
housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($41 million), higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($15 million), and higher provision for loan losses ($3 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were lower income
taxes ($91 million), higher base management and franchise fees ($27 million), lower interest expense ($21 million), a higher minority interest benefit ($14 million), and higher interest income ($1 million).

2007 Compared to 2006

Compared to 2006, income from
continuing operations decreased by $15 million (2 percent) to $697 million in 2007, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by $0.10 (6 percent) to $1.75. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning
with “Operating Income,” the decrease versus the prior year is due to higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($91 million), higher taxes ($61 million), higher interest expense ($60 million), higher loan loss provision ($20
million), lower interest income ($11 million), lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($7 million), and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($5 million). Partially offsetting
these unfavorable variances were higher fee income ($204 million), higher gains and other income ($23 million), higher equity investment results ($12 million), and a higher minority interest benefit ($1 million).

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle


Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions”

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 152,
“Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67,” and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04-2. Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No. 66,
“Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” and FAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and



Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” to exclude accounting for real estate time-sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted
SOP 04-2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter.

Under SOP 04-2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell
timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We also
account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which require us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs.

The adoption of SOP 04-2 in 2006, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated Statements of Income,
resulted in a non-cash after-tax charge of $109 million ($0.25 per diluted share). The pretax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write-down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase
in current liabilities of $18 million.

We estimate that, for the 20-year period from 2009 through 2028, the cost of completing
improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $3.5 billion.

Business Segments

We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments:

•

North American Full-Service Lodging

, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, JW Marriott Hotels &
Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport properties located in the continental United States and Canada;

•

North American Limited-Service Lodging

, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott
ExecuStay properties located in the continental United States and Canada;

•

International Lodging

, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts,
Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada;

•

Luxury Lodging

, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts properties worldwide (together with adjacent residential projects
associated with some Ritz-Carlton hotels), as well as Edition, for which no properties are yet open; and

•

Timeshare

, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences, Grand Residences
by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide.

In addition to the segments above, in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations.

We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, income
taxes, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments. Because note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale
gains in our Timeshare segment results. We also include interest income associated with our Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that segment’s business. Additionally, we
allocate other gains and losses, equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures, divisional general, administrative, and other expenses, and minority interests in income or losses of consolidated subsidiaries to each of our segments.
“Other unallocated corporate” represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments.

We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments
considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational and management reporting structure.



Total Lodging and Timeshare Products by Segment

At year-end 2008, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,332 corporate housing rental units associated with our
ExecuStay brand):

(1)

North American includes properties located in the continental United States and Canada. International includes
properties located outside the continental United States and Canada.

(2)

Represents projects where we manage the related owners’ association. Residential products are included once they
possess a certificate of occupancy.

(3)

Includes resorts that are in active sales as well as those that are sold out. Products in active sales may not be ready
for occupancy.



Revenues

Income from Continuing Operations

We allocate net minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries to our segments.
Accordingly, as of year-end 2008, we allocated net minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as shown in the following table:

Minority Interest



Our business includes our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International,
Luxury, and Timeshare segments. We consider total segment revenues and total segment financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and
results of our operations to those of other lodging companies.

2008 Compared to 2007

We added 215 properties (32,842 rooms) and 42 properties (7,525 rooms) exited the system in 2008, not including residential products. We also added six
residential properties (567 units) in 2008.

Total segment financial results decreased by $422 million (27 percent) to $1,166 million in
2008 from $1,588 million in the prior year, and total segment revenues decreased by $92 million to $12,817 million in 2008, a 1 percent decrease from revenues of $12,909 million in 2007. While demand was weaker in 2008 compared to 2007,
international and full-service properties experienced stronger demand than luxury and limited-service properties. The decrease in revenues included a $259 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net
income. The results, compared to the year-ago period, reflected a decrease of $261 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of lower incentive management fees, $51 million of increased general,
administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $37 million in gains and other income, $29 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, a decrease of $22 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses,
and $14 million of lower equity joint venture results. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $27 million (3 percent) increase in combined base management and franchise fees to $1,086 million in the 2008 period from $1,059 million in
2007 and a $23 million increase in minority interest benefit.

Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from rate increases in
international markets, and new unit growth drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million
in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Compared to 2007, incentive management fees decreased by $58 million (16 percent) in 2008 and reflected the recognition in 2007 of $17
million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds,
also associated with hurricanes in prior years. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property-level profitability due to lower RevPAR, higher property-level wages and benefits costs, and utilities costs, particularly in
North America. In 2008, 56 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 67 percent in 2007. In addition, in 2008, 49 percent of our incentive fees were derived from international hotels versus 35 percent in 2007.

Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties, for
comparable North American properties decreased by 2.7 percent and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties decreased by 2.9 percent.

Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 3.6 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased by 3.3 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable
systemwide properties decreased by 1.5 percent (0.8 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties decreased by 1.1 percent (0.2 percent using actual dollars).

Compared to the year-ago period, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2008 decreased by 70 basis points, reflecting the impact
of stronger year-over-year RevPAR associated with international properties and very tight cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system, more than offset by the impact of year-over-year RevPAR decreases associated with properties in North
America reflecting weaker demand and also higher expenses in North America primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs. North American company-operated house profit margins declined by 140 basis points reflecting significant cost control
plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand and higher operating costs, including those associated with wages and benefits and utilities. For 2008, house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) at our North
American managed properties decreased by 5.8 percent. HP-PAR at our North American limited-service managed properties decreased by 8.0 percent, and worldwide HP-PAR for all our brands increased by 2.6 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis.

2007 Compared to 2006

We added 203
properties (29,200 rooms) and 55 properties (9,722 rooms) exited the system in 2007, not including residential products. We also added three residential properties (347 units) in 2007.



Total segment financial results increased by $173 million (12 percent) to $1,588 million in 2007 from
$1,415 million in 2006, and total segment revenues increased by $979 million to $12,909 million in 2007, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,930 million in 2006. The results, compared to the prior year, reflect a $204 million (17 percent)
increase in combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fees to $1,428 million in 2007 from $1,224 million in 2006, a $16 million increase in earnings associated with equity investments, and a $1 million minority interest benefit.
Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a decrease of $18 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $13 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $10
million in gains and other income, and a decrease of $7 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses.

Higher
RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property-level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth, drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. In 2006, we
recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million (31 percent) during 2007,
reflecting the impact of strong room rate increases and property-level margin improvements associated with productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were
calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds
associated with hurricanes in prior years and base management fees included $6 million and $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years, received in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, 67
percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 62 percent in 2006.

Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North
American properties increased by 6.0 percent over 2006, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company-operated properties increased by 6.2 percent over 2006.

Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 8.4 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company-operated properties increased by 8.9 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable
systemwide properties increased by 6.5 percent (7.6 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company-operated properties increased by 7.0 percent (8.8 percent using actual dollars).

Compared to 2006, 2007 worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased by 150 basis points, while North American company-operated
house profit margins improved by 160 basis points versus 2006. For 2007, compared to 2006, HP-PAR at our full-service managed properties in North America increased by 10.6 percent. HP-PAR at our North American limited-service managed properties
increased by 8.9 percent, and worldwide HP-PAR for all our brands increased by 11.0 percent on a constant dollar basis.

Lodging Development

We opened 215 properties, totaling 32,842 rooms, across our brands in 2008 and 42 properties (7,525 rooms) left the system, not
including residential products. We also added six residential properties (567 units). Highlights of the year included:

•

Converting 31 properties (6,439 rooms), or 19 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 12 percent of those rooms were located in
international markets;

•

Opening approximately 24 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States;

•

Adding 168 properties (19,747 rooms) to our North American Limited-Service brands; and

•

Opening one new Marriott Vacation Club property in Asia on the island of Phuket, Thailand.

We currently have more than 125,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline
and we expect to add over 30,000 hotel rooms to our system in 2009.

Recent events, including failures and near failures of a number of
large financial service companies, have made the capital markets increasingly volatile. Accordingly, given the difficult lending environment, the Company, owners or franchisees may decide to reevaluate continuing some of the projects included in the
development pipeline. While the company has invested in few of its pipeline projects, possible delays, cancellations, or financial restructurings of projects under development could have a negative impact on our financial results.

We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt
service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to sell properties



that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth
plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report.

Statistics

The following tables show occupancy,
average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full-Service and North American Limited-Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment,
The Ritz-Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company-operated Fairfield Inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised, and such information would not be
meaningful (identified as “nm” in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties.

The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2008 include the 53 weeks from December 29, 2007, through
January 2, 2009, the statistics for 2007 include the 52 weeks from December 30, 2006, through December 28, 2007, and the statistics for 2006 include the period from December 31, 2005, through December 29, 2006 (except in

2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 15 properties (4,611 rooms) and three properties (493 rooms) left the system.

In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties decreased by 1.6 percent to $123.98, occupancy decreased by 2.0
percentage points to 70.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 1.2 percent to $176.30.

The $59 million decrease in segment
results, compared to 2007, primarily reflected a $35 million decrease in incentive management fees and a $25 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $2 million increase in base management
and franchise fees.

The $35 million decrease in incentive management fees was in part due to the recognition, in 2007, of business
interruption insurance proceeds totaling $12 million associated with Hurricane Katrina and also reflected lower demand and property-level margins in 2008 compared to 2007. The slight increase of $2 million in base management and franchise fees was a
product of unit growth and an additional week of sales, mostly offset by lower RevPAR.

The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue
net of direct expenses of $25 million primarily reflected an unfavorable $7 million impact associated with two properties undergoing renovations in 2008, $8 million of losses associated with three properties, one of which was a new property that
opened in 2008, $5 million of lower contract termination fees received, $2 million of lower land rent income, and an unfavorable $3 million impact associated with one property that was sold in 2007 and is now a managed property.

Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $4,951 million in 2008, compared to
$4,782 million in 2007.

2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, across our North American Full-Service Lodging segment, we added 13 properties (3,947 rooms) and six properties (2,853 rooms) left the system.

In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American full-service properties increased by 6.8 percent to $126.92, occupancy increased by 0.9 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates
increased by 5.4 percent to $174.54.

The $23 million increase in segment results compared to 2006 reflects a $65 million increase in base
management, incentive management, and franchise fees, partially offset by a $22 million decline in gains and other income and a $20 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses.

The $65 million increase in fees was largely due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margins, driven primarily by rate increases and productivity
improvements. Incentive management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $12 million and base management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $2 million, both of which were for business interruption insurance proceeds associated with Hurricane
Katrina, and no similar fees in 2006. Additionally, 2006 reflected the recognition of $3 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, compared to the recognition of no
similar fees in 2007.

Gains and other income was $22 million lower in 2007, compared to 2006, and reflected a $37 million charge in 2006
associated with a straight-line rent receivable, partially offset by the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in 2006 and $34 million of lower other gains in 2007, compared to 2006. The $34
million decrease in other gains compared to the prior year reflects gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate, while 2007 reflects limited similar activity. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct
expenses decreased by $20 million and reflected properties sold and



$10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2006, compared to $3 million of such fees received in 2007. General,
administrative, and other expenses for 2007 were unchanged compared to 2006 primarily reflecting $5 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments in 2006 offset by a guarantee charge in 2007 associated with one property and the
write-off of a deferred contract acquisition cost associated with another property that left the system.

Cost reimbursements revenue and
expenses associated with our North American Full-Service segment properties totaled $4,782 million in 2007, compared to $4,527 million in 2006.

2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added 168 properties (19,747 rooms) and 21 properties (2,519 rooms) left the system. The properties that left the system were primarily associated
with our Fairfield Inn brand.

In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties decreased by 4.2
percent to $85.83, occupancy decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 69.4 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 0.5 percent to $123.69.

The $66 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2007, reflected $43 million of lower incentive management fees, $14 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $13 million of lower owned, leased, corporate
housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower gains and other income, partially offset by a $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees.

The $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees was largely due to unit growth, partially offset by a decrease in relicensing fees. The
$43 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property-level revenue and margins and the recognition, in 2007, of $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but
not earned and due until 2007.

The $14 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected a $15 million charge
related to a shortfall funding under a guarantee (see the “Other Charges” caption in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information). The $13 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate
housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $6 million of franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, which were primarily associated with Fairfield Inn brand properties that left our system, and $7 million of
lower income due to lower revenue and property-level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties.

Cost
reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,541 million in 2008, compared to $1,470 million in 2007.

2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, across our North American Limited-Service Lodging segment, we added
156 properties (17,517 rooms) and 16 properties (1,853 rooms) left the system. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand.

In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated North American limited-service properties increased by 4.8 percent to $89.18, occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and
average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $122.63.

The $81 million increase in segment results, compared to 2006, primarily
reflected an $83 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, a $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $2 million increase in gains and other income, and a $2 million
increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $11 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses.



In 2007, we recognized $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior
years’ results but not earned and due until 2007 compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2006. The additional increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which increased base management and franchise
fees, and to productivity improvements, which increased property-level margins and incentive management fees. Additionally, growth in the number of rooms contributed to the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $5 million increase in
owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily a result of hotel franchise agreement termination fees of $6 million received in 2007, which were primarily associated with Fairfield Inn brand properties that left our system and
$1 million of similar fees in 2006. The $11 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2007 primarily reflects the impact of unit growth and development and the write-off of $3 million of deferred contract acquisition costs.

Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited-Service segment properties totaled $1,470 million in
2007, compared to $1,423 million in 2006.

2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, across our International Lodging segment, we added 21 properties (6,619 rooms) and 16 properties (3,905 rooms) left the system, primarily due to quality issues.

In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 2.6 percent to $131.00, occupancy for these properties decreased by
2.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.0 percent to $180.81. Results for our international operations were favorable across most regions, but weakened progressively throughout 2008 and especially in the fourth
quarter. RevPAR increases compared to the prior year were strongest in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, South America, and Central Europe.

The $25 million decrease in segment results in 2008, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected a $32 million decrease in gains and other income, a $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other
expenses, and a decrease of $5 million in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by an $18 million increase in incentive management fees and an $11 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees. Owned, leased, and other
revenue net of direct expenses remained unchanged in 2008 compared to the prior year.

The increase in fees was largely due to higher
RevPAR, driven by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, reflected unit growth and cost control plans, which increased property-level margins and incentive management fees.

The $32 million decrease in gains and other income in 2008, compared to 2007, reflected the recognition of gains totaling $9 million in 2008, compared to
gains in 2007 of $41 million. The 2007 gains primarily reflected a $10 million gain associated with the sale of a joint venture and a gain totaling $23 million associated with sales of real estate. The $15 million increase in general,
administrative, and other expenses reflected higher wage and benefit costs and costs associated with unit growth and development.

Joint
venture equity results were lower than the prior year by $5 million primarily reflecting an unfavorable $11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate, partially offset by a $5 million favorable
impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures.

Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct of
expenses remained unchanged and reflected $17 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, which was completely offset by $11 million of stronger results at some properties, $5 million of higher
termination fees, and $1 million of higher branding fees.



Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled
$707 million in 2008, compared to $741 million in 2007.

2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007, across our International Lodging segment, we added 20 properties (4,686 rooms) and 31 properties (4,678 rooms) left the system in 2007, primarily
due to quality issues.

In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated international properties increased by 8.2 percent to $127.44,
occupancy for these properties increased by 0.8 percentage points to 75.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 7.0 percent to $168.30. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. RevPAR increases compared to
the prior year were particularly strong in Central and Southeast Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.

The $34 million
increase in segment results in 2007 compared to 2006, reflected a $27 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, an $11 million increase in gains and other income, and a $3 million increase in joint venture equity
earnings, partially offset by $7 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. Incentive management fees included $2 million for 2007 that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings, but not earned and due until
recognized, compared to $10 million of similar fees in 2006.

The increase in fees is largely due to strong demand and higher RevPAR,
driven by rate increases and favorable exchange rates. The $11 million increase in gains and other income reflected higher gains in 2007 on real estate sales, compared to the year-ago period, offset by lower gains on the sale of joint ventures. The
$7 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses from 2006 is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained flat primarily reflecting
hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees of $8 million received in 2007 and $12 million of similar fees in 2006, entirely offset by the improved performance of our owned and leased properties in 2007.

Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $741 million in 2007, compared to $635 million in
2006.

Luxury Lodging

includes

The Ritz-Carlton

and

Bulgari Hotels & Resorts

.

2008 Compared to 2007

In 2008, across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added four properties (1,195 rooms) and one property (517 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added seven residential products (654 units) in 2008.

In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties decreased by 0.1 percent to $225.87, occupancy for these properties decreased by 1.9
percentage points to 69.2 percent, and average daily rates increased by 2.7 percent to $326.63.

The $6 million increase in segment
results, compared to 2007, reflected a $7 million increase in base management and incentive management fees and $18 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $8 million of increased general,
administrative, and other expenses, an $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings, $1 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, (see Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for additional
information), and a $1 million decrease in gains and other income. The increase in fees over the year-ago period reflected new properties added to the system, partially offset by the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance
proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years.

The $18 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses
reflected charges of $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified to “held and used,” as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as “held for sale,”
compared to $6 million of depreciation charges for that same property in 2008, as well as expenses totaling $3 million in 2007 associated with opening a new leased property, $10 million of improved results in 2008 associated with two properties, one
of which was being renovated in 2007, and $2 million of increased branding fees in 2008.



The $8 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected costs
associated with unit growth and development as well as bad debt expense related to accounts receivable deemed uncollectible (see the “Other Charges” caption in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for
more information).

The $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected a $9 million impairment charge associated
with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired in 2008 (see the “Other Charges” caption in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information).

Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,350 million in 2008, compared to $1,307 million in
2007.

2007 Compared to 2006

In 2007,
across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added 11 properties (2,529 rooms) and one property (273 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added three residential products (347 units) in 2007.

In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company-operated luxury properties increased by 9.4 percent to $227.87, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.8
percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.6 percent to $314.36.

The $9 million increase in segment
results, compared to 2006, reflected a $20 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, partially offset by $6 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, $3 million of lower owned, leased, and other
revenue net of direct expenses, and $2 million of lower equity joint venture results. Fiscal year 2006 included $2 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, compared
to no similar fees in 2007. The increase in fees over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR driven by rate increases, new properties added to the system, the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with
hurricanes in prior years, the year-over-year favorable impact associated with the reopening, late in 2006, of two properties impacted by the same aforementioned hurricanes and increased branding fees. The $6 million increase in general,
administrative, and other expenses is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. The $3 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges totaling $8 million in 2007 for
depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified to “held and used,” as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as “held for sale,” partially offset by a favorable $3 million impact
associated with the opening of a new leased property in 2007.

Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment
properties totaled $1,307 million in 2007, compared to $1,261 million in 2006.



Timeshare

includes our

Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences, Grand
Residences by Marriott

, and

Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club

brands.

2008 Compared to 2007

Timeshare segment contract sales, including sales made by our timeshare joint venture projects, represent sales of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential ownership products before the adjustment of
percentage-of-completion accounting. Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by $325 million (23 percent) compared to 2007 to $1,076 million from $1,401 million. The decrease in Timeshare segment contract sales in 2008, compared to the prior
year, reflected a $173 million decrease in timeshare sales, an $83 million decrease in residential sales, and a $69 million decrease in fractional sales. The decrease in timeshare contract sales reflected the impact of projects approaching sellout
and significantly lower demand. Sales of residential and fractional units were significantly impacted by weak demand, as well as increased cancellation allowances of $115 million recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously
recorded under the percentage-of-completion method for certain projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other
Charges,” for additional information).

The $315 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,750 million from $2,065 million
reflected a $324 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, and a $1 million decrease in base management fees, partially offset by a $10 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services
revenue, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential projects, lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in
2008, a $32 million impact from the reduced valuation of residual interests, contract cancellation allowances of $17 million, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability
thresholds, as well as the recognition, in 2007, of revenues received in prior years for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points
program, revenue that became reportable subsequent to the 2007 fiscal year, and increased services revenue. Timeshare segment revenues for 2008 and 2007 included



$68 million and $50 million, respectively, of interest income and note sale gains of $16 million and $81 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Segment results of $28 million in 2008 decreased by $278 million from $306 million in 2007, and reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and
services revenue net of direct expenses, $28 million of restructuring costs, and $13 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by a $24 million higher minority interest benefit and $1 million in higher joint
venture equity earnings.

The $261 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $138
million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4
million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval,
fractional, and residential projects, increased marketing and sales costs, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, start-up costs in 2008 for newer projects, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer
projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds, revenue recognition for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, a $9 million impact from inventory write-downs related to the termination of
certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, and a $5 million net impact from contract cancellation allowances (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for
additional information). In addition, development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected an impairment charge. We recorded a pretax charge of $22 million ($10 million net of minority interest benefit) in the 2008
third quarter within the “Timeshare-direct” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income related to the impairment of a fractional and whole ownership real estate project held for development by a joint venture that we consolidate. We
made the adjustment in accordance with FAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” to adjust the carrying value of the real estate to its estimated fair value at year-end 2008. The predominant items
we considered in our analysis were the downturn in market conditions including contract cancellations, and tightening in the credit markets, especially for jumbo mortgage loans. We estimated the fair value of the inventory utilizing a probability
weighted cash flow model that reflected our expectations of future performance discounted at a 10 year risk-free interest rate determined from the yield curve for U.S. Treasury instruments (3.68 percent). The $25 million benefit associated with
minority interest reflected our joint venture partner’s portion of the losses of subsidiaries that we consolidate. The $25 million benefit also reflected the impact of the pretax benefit of $12 million in 2008, representing our joint venture
partner’s pretax share of the $22 million impairment charge.

The $95 million decrease in financing revenue, net of financing costs,
primarily reflected $65 million of lower note sale gains in 2008 compared to 2007, mostly attributable to higher note sale volumes in 2007, $42 million of lower residual interest accretion, and $6 million of increased financing costs, partially
offset by $18 million of increased interest income. Lower note sale gains of $65 million reflected a $12 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to hedge ineffectiveness on note sale hedges and the $42 million of lower residual interest
accretion reflected a $32 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which future cash flows were discounted to estimate the fair
market value (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for more information regarding these charges). In 2008 and 2007, we sold notes receivable originated by our Timeshare
segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products of $300 million and $520 million, respectively. The $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses represented increased marketing and
selling costs coupled with increased product cost relative to prior year.

The $28 million of restructuring costs represented $14 million
in severance costs, $9 million in development cancellations, and $5 million in facility exit costs incurred as a result of restructuring initiatives at the segment (see Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for
more information related to these initiatives and the costs incurred). The $13 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected increased costs associated with wages and benefits. Joint venture equity earnings increased $1
million and reflected $10 million of start-up losses incurred in 2007 for three joint ventures, mostly offset by $7 million of contract cancellation allowances recorded at one joint venture in 2008 (see the “Other Charges” caption of
Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for additional information) and $3 million of lower earnings in 2008 at one joint venture.

Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $285 million in 2008, compared to $275 million in 2007.



2007 Compared to 2006

Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by 14 percent compared to 2006, reflecting fewer residential and fractional sales, partially offset by increased timeshare sales. Contract sales in 2006 reflected
particularly strong joint venture residential sales associated with the launch of our San Francisco and Kapalua, Hawaii products.

The $225
million increase in Timeshare segment revenues to $2,065 million from $1,840 million reflected a $170 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue, a $46 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and $9 million of increased base
management fees. The increase in timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 and increased services and financing revenue. Higher base management fees reflect the growing
number of timeshare resorts under management. Timeshare segment revenues include $50 million and $41 million of interest income for 2007 and 2006, respectively, and note sale gains of $81 million and $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively,
recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income on the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable.

Segment results of $306 million in 2007 increased by $26 million over 2006 and primarily reflected $9 million of increased base management fees, $12 million of increased joint venture equity results, and $11 million
of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $7 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of expenses. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million,
compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, partially offset by the $15 million reversal of
contingency reserves in 2006 and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007,
offset by several other projects that were approaching sell-out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, compared to 2006. Compared to the
prior year, the $12 million increase in joint venture equity results primarily reflected strong demand in 2007 for our products in Kapalua, Hawaii and start-up costs in 2006 associated with that joint venture. The $11 million decrease in general,
administrative, and other expenses reflected lower program and systems expenses in 2007.

Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses
associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $275 million in 2007, compared to $229 million in 2006.

Investment in Leveraged Lease

Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Airlines, which we acquired in 1994. The gross
investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us
that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $17 million in 2005 and $1 million in 2006. We recorded an additional $5 million loss related to this investment in
fiscal 2007, and have no remaining exposure.

Effective Tax Rate

Tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years. As we exited the business in November 2007 our effective tax rate increased
significantly, thereby reducing our after-tax profits.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Synthetic Fuel

The tax credits provided under Internal Revenue Code Section 45K were only
available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through December 31, 2007. Given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phase-out of a significant portion of tax credits available for synthetic
fuel produced and sold in 2007, we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on November 3, 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 3, “Discontinued Operations-Synthetic
Fuel,” in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment.

2008 Compared to 2007

The synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $1 million in 2008 and $352 million in 2007. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment totaled $3 million,
net of tax, in 2008, compared to a loss of $1 million in 2007. Income



from the Synthetic Fuel segment of $3 million for 2008 primarily reflected the recognition in 2008 of additional tax credits as a result of the determination
by the Secretary of the Treasury in 2008 of the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2007, partially offset by payments due to third parties based on the amount of additional tax credits.

2007 Compared to 2006

For 2007, the synthetic fuel
operation generated revenue of $352 million versus revenue of $165 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting higher production in 2007. Production in 2006 reflected production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. Income from
the Synthetic Fuel segment declined to a loss of $1 million in 2007 from income of $5 million in 2006, primarily reflecting increased operating losses associated with higher production in 2007, partially offset by increased revenue and increased tax
credits associated with higher production and, on the increased operating losses, a higher tax benefit. Results for 2007 also reflect an estimated 70.7 percent phase-out of tax credits due to high oil prices versus a phase-out that was estimated at
year-end 2006 to be 39 percent for 2006. Additionally, results in 2007 reflect interest costs of $8 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award:
(1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (“Stock Option Program”); (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”); (3) restricted stock units of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock
units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.

During 2008 we granted 5.6 million restricted stock units (2.6 million, most of which were granted in February and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $35 per unit and 3.0 million were granted in
August and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $26 per unit), 2.7 million Employee SARs (1.8 million, most of which were granted in February and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $13 per right and 0.9 million were
granted in August and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $10 per right), and 4,000 Non-employee SARs. During that time period, we also granted approximately 218,000 stock options and issued 25,000 deferred stock units. The grants made
in August would ordinarily have been made in February 2009, but were accelerated to encourage associate retention in a difficult economic climate. Awards for the most senior executives were not accelerated. See Footnote No. 4, “Share-Based
Compensation,” later in this report for additional information.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

EITF Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of
Condominiums”

We adopted the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the
Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums” (“EITF 06-8”) on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. EITF 06-8 states that in assessing the
collectibility of the sales price pursuant to paragraph 37(d) of Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate” (“FAS No. 66”), an entity should evaluate the adequacy of
the buyer’s initial and continuing investment to conclude that the sales price is collectible. If an entity is unable to meet the criteria of paragraph 37, including an assessment of collectibility using the initial and continuing investment
tests described in paragraphs 8 through 12 of FAS No. 66, then the entity should apply the deposit method of accounting as described in paragraphs 65 through 67 of FAS No. 66.

Although our adoption of EITF 06-8 had no impact on our wholly owned projects in conjunction with the adoption of EITF 06-8 by one joint venture in which
we are a partner, we recorded the cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8 as a reduction of $5 million to our investment in that joint venture, an increase in deferred tax assets of $2 million, and a reduction of $3 million to the opening balance of
our retained earnings. The application of the continuing investment criterion in EITF 06-8 on the collectibility of the sales price could in certain future circumstances delay our ability, or the ability of joint ventures in which we are a partner,
to recognize revenues and costs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements”

We adopted FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS No. 157”), on
December 29, 2007, the first day of fiscal year 2008. FAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. On February 12, 2008, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,” which amends FAS No. 157 by delaying its effective date by one year for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items
that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Therefore, beginning on December 29, 2007,



this standard applied prospectively to new fair value measurements of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of non-financial assets and
non-financial liabilities. On January 3, 2009, the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year, the standard will also apply to all other fair value measurements. See Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” for additional information.

Our servicing assets and residual interests, which are measured using Level 3 inputs (which are described in Footnote No. 5,
“Fair Value Measurements”) in the FAS No. 157 hierarchy, accounted for 94 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at year-end 2008, that are required to be measured at fair value using the guidance found in FAS
No. 157. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and accordingly, we recorded
realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of our residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. The implementation of FAS
No. 157 did not result in material changes to the models or processes used to value these assets. These transactions may utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest margin associated with the beneficial interest. The discount rates
we use in determining the fair values of the residual interests are based on the general level of interest rates in the market and the assumed credit risk of the interests retained. We adjust these discount rates quarterly as interest rates and
credit spreads in the market vary.

During 2008, we used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests,
including servicing assets, at the date of sale: average discount rate of 9.23 percent; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 24.01 percent; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments
and defaults, of 76 months; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months. Our key assumptions are based on experience with notes receivable and servicing assets.

The most significant estimate involved in the measurement process is the discount rate, followed by the default rate and the loan repayment rate.
Estimates of these rates are based on management’s expectations of future prepayment rates and default rates, reflecting our historical experience, industry trends, current market interest rates, expected future interest rates, and other
considerations. Actual repayment rates, default rates, and discount rates could differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the availability of alternative
financing sources to borrowers. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced were to occur more slowly than had been projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously
projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are lower than expected, the carrying value of retained interests could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts. If actual prepayments
of the loans being serviced occur at a faster pace than we have projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual
discount rates are higher than we expect, the carrying value of retained interests could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. Accordingly, the retained interests, including servicing assets,
actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially recorded.

We completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual
interests, including servicing assets, as of the end of 2008 to measure the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. This methodology applied unfavorable changes that would be statistically significant for the
key variables of prepayment rate, discount rate, and weighted average remaining term. Before we applied any of these stress test changes, we determined that the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, was $221 million as of
year-end 2008.



Applying the stress tests, we concluded that each change to a variable shown in the table below would
have the following impact on the valuation of our residual interests at the end of 2008:

We value our derivatives using valuations that are calibrated to the initial trade prices.
Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rates and volatilities. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivative instruments in gains from the sale of timeshare notes
receivable, which are recorded within the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Financial
Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

We adopted FAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115” (“FAS No. 159”), on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. This standard permits but does not require entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We
did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our financial assets or liabilities in 2008.

EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for
Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause”

We adopted EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66,
‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause” (“EITF 07-6”), on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. EITF 07-6 clarifies whether a buy-sell clause is a
prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No. 66. EITF 07-6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the
deposit, profit sharing, leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy-sell clause performed in fiscal years 2008 and thereafter. The adoption of EITF 07-6 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

FASB Staff Position FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 “Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and
Interests in Variable Interest Entities”

We adopted FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8
“Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities” in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year-end. FSP FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 amends FAS No. 140 to
require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transferors’ continuing involvements with transferred financial assets. It also amends FIN 46(R) to require public enterprises, including sponsors that have a variable interest in
a variable interest entity, to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest entities. The FSP also requires disclosures by a public enterprise that is a sponsor of a qualifying special-purpose entity
(“SPE”) that holds a variable interest in the qualifying SPE but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE and a servicer of a qualifying SPE that holds a significant variable interest in the qualifying SPE but was
not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE. FSP FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 is effective for year-end 2008 disclosures. The adoption of FSP FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.

FSP EITF 99-20-1 “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20, ‘Recognition of Interest Income and
Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets’”

We adopted FSP EITF 99-20-1 “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20, ‘Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That
Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets,’” (“FSP EITF 99-20-1”) in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year-end. FSP EITF 99-20-1 amends EITF Issue No. 99-20 to align the impairment guidance in EITF
Issue



No. 99-20 with that of FAS No. 115. FAS No. 115 measures impairment based on a determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment has
occurred. Our residual interests in our asset securitizations are recorded at fair value each reporting period. Therefore, the adoption of FSP EITF 99-20-1 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Future Adoption of Accounting Standards

Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations”

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141
(Revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“FAS No. 141(R)”). FAS No. 141(R) will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS No. 141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize
all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Transaction costs will no longer be included in the measurement of the business acquired. Instead, these costs will be
expensed as they are incurred. FAS No. 141(R) also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year.

Financial Accounting
Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB No. 51”

On
December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB No. 51” (“FAS No. 160”). FAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and
reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated
financial statements separate from the parent’s equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No. 160 clarifies that
changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain
or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements
regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. FAS No. 160 must be applied prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins
with our 2009 fiscal year, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133”

In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS No. 161”). FAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosure related to derivatives and hedging activities and thereby seeks to improve the transparency of financial
reporting. Under FAS No. 161, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures relating to: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (b) how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under FAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS No. 133”), and its related interpretations; and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. FAS No. 161 must be applied prospectively to all derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments and related hedged items
accounted for under FAS No. 133 for all financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS
No. 161 will have on our financial statements.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities

Although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor
of hotel properties, we depend on capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels and to develop timeshare properties. Events over the past several months, including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial services companies
have made the capital markets increasingly volatile. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also
periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons, or to further strengthen
our financial position.

We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) that provides for
borrowings and letters of credit and has supported our commercial paper program. The Credit Facility provides for $2.5 billion of aggregate borrowings at any one time, and expires on May 14, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear
interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed spread. Additionally, we pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For additional information regarding our Credit Facility, including
participating financial institutions, see Exhibit 10, “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,” to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2007.

The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits the Company’s maximum leverage (defined in the
credit agreement as Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy
the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including being well within the limits under the Credit Facility leverage covenant, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to increase our anticipated borrowing and
guarantee levels should we need to do so in the future.

Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. (“LCPI”), a subsidiary of Lehmann Brothers
Holdings Inc., which filed for bankruptcy on October 5, 2008, is one of the lenders under the Credit Facility, with a total aggregate funding commitment of $96 million (3.8 percent) of the $2.5 billion in total commitments. LCPI did not fund
its share of our fourth quarter 2008 draws under the Credit Facility, and we have no reason to expect that it will do so in the future. Accordingly, the total current effective size of the Credit Facility is approximately $2.4 billion. The loss of
$96 million in effective capacity is not material to us, and the Credit Facility, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remains adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth
plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.

At year-end 2008, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.443
billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $2.404 billion under our Credit Facility, and our cash balance of $134 million, less letters of credit outstanding totaling $126 million, and less Credit Facility borrowings outstanding of $969 million. We
anticipate that this available capacity is adequate to fund our liquidity needs as noted above. In addition, as noted previously, we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facility’s covenants, and accordingly expect undrawn bank
commitments under the Credit Facility to remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate considerably more than we anticipate.

Until early in the 2008 fourth quarter, we regularly issued short-term commercial paper primarily in the United States and, to a much lesser extent, in Europe. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the
then-current demand for our commercial paper in each of these markets, as we do not have purchase commitments from buyers. Disruptions in the financial markets in September 2008 significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market.
Accordingly, in September 2008 we borrowed under the Credit Facility to fund anticipated short-term commercial paper maturities and, to a lesser extent, other general corporate needs, including working capital and capital expenditures, and suspended
issuing commercial paper. All of our previously issued commercial paper has matured and been repaid. We anticipate issuing commercial paper when that market stabilizes and issuances can be made on favorable terms. We classify commercial paper as
long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available
to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. Fluctuations in the commercial paper market have not affected our liquidity and we do not expect them to do so in the future, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.



In November 2008 Standard & Poor’s changed the outlook on our BBB credit rating to
“negative,” which resulted in an automatic downgrade in our commercial paper rating from A2 to A3. The market for A3 commercial paper is currently very limited. This limited availability, together with the higher interest costs associated
with A3 issuances, currently makes it difficult and expensive for us to access the commercial paper market. Any future downgrades of our debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service, or other similar rating agencies
could increase our cost of capital. We cannot assure you that downgrades will not occur in the future.

Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.3 to 1.0 at year-end 2008 and 1.2
to 1.0 at year-end 2007. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, aggressive collection efforts, and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should
we need additional working capital.

Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are
detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows:

In response to significantly lower demand for our timeshare products, we have correspondingly
reduced our projected capital expenditures for 2009. While our Timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow, year-to-year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new
resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our
Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment). As discussed in the second and third paragraphs following the table, the turmoil in the credit markets hurt the asset
securitization market in 2008. Accordingly, we completed only one note sale transaction in 2008, compared with two such transactions in each of 2006 and 2007, and accordingly, note sale proceeds and note sale gains were both significantly lower in
2008 than in the prior two years.

In June 2008, prior to the end of our second quarter, we sold to a newly formed trust $300 million
of notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. On the same day, the trust issued $246 million of the trust’s notes. In connection with the sale of notes
receivable, we received net proceeds of $237 million. We retained residual interests with a fair value on the day of sale of $93 million. We used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing
assets, at the date of sale: average discount rate of 9.23 percent; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 24.01 percent; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 76
months; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months. Our key assumptions are based on our experience



with Timeshare segment notes receivable that we originate. We recorded note sale gains totaling $16 million in 2008, which was net of a $12 million charge
related to hedge ineffectiveness.

Less favorable conditions in the asset securitization markets have reduced our gain from Timeshare
segment note sales during the past year, as the trusts that purchased our mortgage notes have had to issue debt at higher relative interest rates and, in the second quarter 2008 transaction, we retained a larger residual interest in the trust. For
example, in the 2008 second quarter note sale, the trust that purchased our mortgage notes issued AAA rated asset backed notes at a spread of 325 basis points over the 3.935 percent interest swap rate on LIBOR, compared to AAA note spreads of 100
basis points over the 4.782 percent interest swap rate on LIBOR for the 2007 fourth quarter note sale and 30 basis points over the 5.192 percent interest swap rate on LIBOR for the 2007 second quarter note sale. In addition, while the trusts in the
fourth and second quarter 2007 securitizations each also issued 15.5 percent of the total principal amount of their asset backed notes at less than AAA ratings, we believed that the market for lower rated notes during the second quarter of 2008 was
insufficient to permit issuance of AA, A, and BBB+ rated notes at attractive spreads. Accordingly, we decided to retain a larger residual interest in the trust for the second quarter 2008 transaction rather than having the trust offer lower rated
notes. Given the further deterioration in the credit markets during the fourth quarter of 2008, we decided to postpone our planned note sale until 2009.

As of the date this annual report on Form 10-K is filed, the securitization market remains extremely uncertain, and very limited current demand for securitized loans makes that market much more difficult to access
than it has been in the past. We believe, nonetheless, that alternatives remain available to us to sell our timeshare notes, record note sale gains, and thereby reduce our timeshare notes receivable balances and improve our cash flow. However, we
expect any transaction that we may be able to complete in the near term will be more costly to us, and result in lower note sale gains, if any, relative to the size of the transaction, than those we have experienced in previous years.

Investing Activities Cash Flows

Capital
Expenditures and Other Investments.

We made capital expenditures of $357 million in 2008, $671 million in 2007, and $529 million in 2006 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of
hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in “Cash from Operations,” as noted in that section, are not reflected in these
numbers. Capital expenditures decreased primarily due to a reduction in development spending. We expect that near-term capital expenditures will be lower than 2008 levels. See the discussion of “Development and Financing Risks” within the
Risk Factors section of this document for possible impacts of this reduction. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long-term management agreements. The ability of third-party purchasers to raise the necessary debt
and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do
so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in
capital market conditions. We also expect to continue to make other selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments.

Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging and Timeshare segments because:
(1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our
management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale.

Dispositions.

Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of
$38 million in 2008, $745 million in 2007, and $798 million in 2006. In 2008, we closed on the sales of two properties, two land parcels, and an interest in an entity that leases four hotels.

Loan Activity.

We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based
on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2008 and 2007,
amounted to net loan advances of $17 million in 2008 and net loan collections and sales of $75 million in 2007. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled $2 million, all of which was long-term, at year-end 2008 and $7 million (which included a
current portion of $4 million) at year-end 2007. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $236 million (which included a current portion of $15 million) at year-end 2008 and $206 million (which included a current portion of $17 million) at year-end
2007. In 2008, our notes receivable balance associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, increased by $25 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserve against one
loan.



Equity and Cost Method Investments.

Cash outflows of $25 million in 2008, $40 million in 2007, and
$95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.

Cash from
Financing Activities

Debt.

Debt increased by $130 million in 2008, to $3,095 million at year-end 2008 from $2,965 million, and
reflected $969 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, mostly offset by the decrease in commercial paper outstanding of $585 million, the repayment, upon maturity, of $91 million of Series E Senior Notes in the 2008 first quarter,
repurchase of $109 million of Senior Notes across multiple series, and other debt decreases of $54 million. Debt increased by $1,132 million in 2007, to $2,965 million at year-end 2007 from $1,833 million, due to the issuance of $346 million (book
value at issuance) of Series I Senior Notes (described more fully in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K), the issuance of $397 million (book value at issuance) of Series J Senior Notes (described more fully in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K),
a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of $270 million and other debt increases of $119 million.

Our financial objectives include
diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2008, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 4.8 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.6
years. The ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total long-term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2008. At the end of 2008, we had long-term public debt ratings of BBB from Standard and Poor’s and Baa2 from Moody’s.

See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities,” caption within this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for additional
information on our Credit Facility.

In 2008, we repurchased, in the open market, $109 million of our Senior Notes, across multiple series.
The debt extinguishment resulted in a gain of $28 million that was recorded for the difference between the purchase price of $77 million and the respective carrying amount of $105 million of the debt.

Share Repurchases.

We purchased 11.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2008 at an average price of $31.18 per share,
41.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2007 at an average price of $43.32 per share, and 41.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2006 at an average price of $38.13 per share. We purchase shares in the open
market and in privately negotiated transactions. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of year-end 2008, 21.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. We do
not expect share repurchase activity in 2009.

Dividends.

In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash
dividend by 17 percent to $0.0875 per share. Dividends of $115 million were paid in 2008, a 10 percent increase over 2007.

Contractual Obligations and
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year-end 2008:

Contractual Obligations

(1)

Includes principal as well as interest payments.



The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 was $141 million and
$132 million, respectively, and is not reflected in the Contractual Obligations table. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. It is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits could change during the next 52-week period, but we do not anticipate that a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur. See Footnote No. 2, “Income Taxes,” for additional information.

The following table summarizes our commitments as of year-end 2008:

Other Commercial Commitments

Our guarantees where we are the primary obligor of $298 million listed in the preceding table
include $33 million of operating profit guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties, along with $3 million of debt service guarantees that will not be in effect until the
underlying debt has been funded.

The guarantees in the preceding table for which we are secondarily liable include $206 million of
guarantees that we anticipate will expire in the years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations totaling $145 million and lifecare bonds of $61 million for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc.
(“Sunrise”) is the primary obligor of the leases and $9 million of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CNL”), which subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of
$50 million of the lifecare bonds. Five Star is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of
consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. While we currently do not expect to fund
under the guarantees, according to recent SEC filings made by Sunrise there has been a significant deterioration in Sunrise’s financial position and access to liquidity; accordingly, Sunrise’s continued ability to meet these guarantee
obligations cannot be assured.

The guarantees in the preceding table for which we are secondarily liable include lease obligations
for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $6 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $67 million.
Most of these obligations expire at the end of 2023. CTF Holdings Ltd. (“CTF”) had originally made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees (approximately
€7 million [$10 million] remained at year-end 2008). As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $67 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these
guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future.

In
addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied
by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under the
guarantee. At year-end 2008, the carrying value of the liabilities associated with this project completion guarantee was $6 million. We have provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total
cost of $460 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in
the joint venture, which is 20 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. At year-end 2008, the carrying value of the liabilities associated with this project completion guarantee was $3 million.

In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by
joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions.



In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2008, we had extended approximately $10
million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $8 million, which expire within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire in one year.

At year-end 2008, we also had commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to
purchase North American full-service and limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel-anchored mixed-use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $34 million within three years; and $10 million after three years. Of the $44 million
in commitments, we expect to fund $29 million within one to two years and $15 million within three years. In addition, as of year-end 2008, we had commitments, with no expiration date, to fund up to $25 million in joint ventures for development of
new properties of which we expect to fund $13 million within one year and $12 million in one to two years. Also, as of year-end 2008, we had a commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $8 million in a joint venture of which we have funded
$1 million and have $7 million remaining that we do not expect to fund. And, as of year-end 2008, we had a commitment to invest up to $28 million (€20 million) in a joint venture in which we are a partner. We do not expect to fund under this
commitment.

At year-end 2008, we had $126 million of letters of credit outstanding, the majority of which related to our self-insurance
programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2008 totaled $465 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance programs.

In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we
manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Equity Method Investments

We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees
to these entities. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 50 percent. The amount of consolidated retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings attributable to our equity investments totaled
$3 million at year-end 2008.

The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related
disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and

•

changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.

Marriott Rewards

Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our
lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies.
Points, which we track on members’ behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for
cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures.

We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our
future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the “breakage”
for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points.

Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing,
promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from
properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the
points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed.

Valuation of Goodwill

We evaluate the fair value of
goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting
unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections, which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is greater
than its estimated fair value.



Loan Loss Reserves

Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans

We measure loan impairment based
on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference
between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, that assumes certain growth projections that may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment
policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. When we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year-end 2008, our recorded investment
in impaired loans was $157 million. We had a $113 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses, leaving $44 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At
year-end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $112 million. We had a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During
2008 and 2007, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $135 million and $102 million, respectively.

Loans to Timeshare
Owners

In accordance with the adoption of SOP 04-2 in 2006, we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable
that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes
receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable from 2004 to the current year. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales
over the life of those notes. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, our allowance for credit losses associated with “Loans to timeshare owners” totaled $35 million and $19 million, respectively.

Legal Contingencies

We are subject to various legal
proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting
period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances.

Income Taxes

We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities
based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.

Changes in existing tax laws and rates, their related interpretations, as well as the uncertainty generated by the current economic
environment may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately
reflected in the accounting estimates.

OTHER MATTERS

Inflation

Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of
credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future.

We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating-rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of
Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating-rate long-term debt and the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt.

We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt securities. We are also subject to risk from changes in
equity prices from an investment in common stock, which has a carrying value of $10 million at year-end 2008, which we account for as available-for-sale securities under FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities.”

We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

At year-end 2008, we were party to the following derivative instruments:

•

An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by
effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap was $92 million and it matures in 2010.

•

Four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note
sales. Historically, we have been required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps was $111 million, and they expire
through 2022.

•

Two interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted timeshare note sales. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts was
$149 million at year-end 2008, and they expire in 2012.

•

Forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts and fees denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts
was approximately $89 million, and they expire in 2009 and 2010.

•

Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional
amounts of the forward contracts was $190 million at year-end 2008 and they expire in 2009.

•

Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts offset the
gains and losses associated with translation adjustments for various investments in foreign operations. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the investments remaining at year-end 2008 was $15 million and they expire in 2009.



The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and
other financial instruments as of year-end 2008:



Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The following
financial information is included on the pages indicated:



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Marriott International, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and
effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies
and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Company’s transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In connection with the preparation of the Company’s annual consolidated financial
statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”). Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the
operational effectiveness of those controls.

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of January 2, 2009, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the
Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on the next page of this annual
report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Marriott International, Inc.:

We have audited Marriott International, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“the COSO criteria”). Marriott International, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, Marriott International, Inc. maintained in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets
of Marriott International, Inc. as of January 2, 2009 and December 28, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended January 2, 2009, of Marriott International, Inc. and our report dated February 12, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows of Marriott International, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” or the “Company”).

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods, and the disclosures of contingent liabilities. Accordingly, ultimate results could differ from those
estimates.

As a result of the discontinuation of our synthetic fuel business on November 3, 2007, the balances and
activities of the synthetic fuel reportable segment have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2008 presentation. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present
fairly our financial position at fiscal year-end 2008 and fiscal year-end 2007 and the results of our operations and cash flows for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006. We have eliminated all material intercompany transactions and balances between
entities consolidated in these financial statements.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to December 31. The fiscal years in the following table encompass a 52-week period, except
for 2002 and 2008, which both encompass a 53-week period. Unless otherwise specified, each reference to a particular year means the fiscal year ended on the date shown in the following table, rather than the corresponding calendar year:

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues include: (1) base management and incentive management fees; (2) franchise fees; (3) revenues from lodging
properties and other businesses owned or leased by us; (4) timeshare sales and services, which also includes resort rental revenue, interest income associated with our “Loans to timeshare owners,” Timeshare segment note securitization
gains, and revenue from our points-based use system; and (5) cost reimbursements. Management fees comprise a base fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of hotels, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on hotel profitability.
Franchise fees comprise initial application fees and continuing royalties generated from our franchise programs, which permit the hotel owners and operators to use certain of our brand names. Cost reimbursements include direct and indirect costs
that are reimbursed to us by lodging properties that we manage or franchise.

Base Management and Incentive Management Fees:

We
recognize base management fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the contract. In interim periods and at year-end, we recognize incentive management fees that would be due as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any
termination fees payable or receivable by us.

Franchise Fee Revenue

: We recognize franchise fees as revenue in each accounting
period as fees are earned from the franchisee.

Owned and Leased Units

: We recognize room sales and revenues from other guest
services for our owned and leased units when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered.



Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums

: We recognize sales when: (1) we have
received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price; (2) the purchaser’s period to cancel for a refund has expired; (3) we deem the receivables to be collectible; and (4) we have attained certain minimum sales and construction
levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the project has progressed beyond the preliminary stages but has not yet
reached completion, all revenue and profit are deferred and recognized in earnings using the percentage of completion method.

Timeshare
Points-Based Use System Revenue

: As sales under this points-based use system are considered to be the sale of real estate, we recognize these sales when the criteria noted in the “Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums”
caption are met.

Timeshare Residential (Stand-Alone Structures)

: We recognize sales under the full accrual method of accounting
when we receive our proceeds and transfer title at settlement.

Cost Reimbursements

: We recognize cost reimbursements from managed,
franchised, and timeshare properties when we incur the related reimbursable costs.

Other Revenue

includes third-party licensing
fees, other branding fees, land rental income, and other revenue.

Ground Leases

We are both the lessor and lessee of land under long-term operating leases, which include scheduled increases in minimum rents. We
recognize these scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term.

Real Estate Sales

We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 66, “Accounting
for Sales of Real Estate” (“FAS No. 66”). We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards
of ownership. In sales transactions where we retain a management contract, the terms and conditions of the management contract are generally comparable to the terms and conditions of the management contracts obtained directly with third-party owners
in competitive bid processes.

Profit Sharing Plan

We contribute to a profit sharing plan for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in
the plan. Contributions are determined based on a specified percentage of salary deferrals by participating employees. We recognized compensation costs from profit sharing of $111 million in 2008, $107 million in 2007, and $86 million in 2006.

Self-Insurance Programs

We are self-insured for certain levels of property, liability, workers’ compensation and employee medical coverage. We accrue estimated costs of these self-insurance programs at the present value of projected
settlements for known and incurred but not reported claims. We use a discount rate of 3.0 percent to determine the present value of the projected settlements, which we consider to be reasonable given our history of settled claims, including payment
patterns and the fixed nature of the individual settlements.

We are subject to a variety of assessments related to our
insurance activities, including those by state guaranty funds and workers’ compensation second-injury funds. Our liabilities recorded for assessments are reflected within the amounts shown in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on the
self-insurance reserves line, are not discounted, and totaled $4 million and $5 million for year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, respectively. Our liability of $4 million as of year-end 2008 for assessments is expected to be paid by the end of 2009.

Marriott Rewards

Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and
residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members’ behalf, can be redeemed for stays at
most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to



participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members’
qualifying expenditures.

We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program
partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including
an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points.

Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including
marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue
from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of
the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Our liability for the Marriott Rewards program was
$1,536 million at year-end 2008 and $1,392 million at year-end 2007.

Guarantees

We record a liability for the fair value of a guarantee on the date a guarantee is issued or modified. The offsetting entry depends on the
circumstances in which the guarantee was issued. Funding under the guarantee reduces the recorded liability. When no funding is forecasted, the liability is amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the guarantee. On
a quarterly basis, we evaluate all material estimated liabilities based on the operating results and the terms of the guarantee. If we conclude that it is probable that we will be required to fund a greater amount than previously estimated, we will
record a loss.

Rebates and Allowances

We participate in various vendor rebate and allowance arrangements as a manager of hotel properties. There are three types of programs that are common in the hotel industry that are sometimes referred to as
“rebates” or “allowances,” including unrestricted rebates, marketing (restricted) rebates and sponsorships. The primary business purpose of these arrangements is to secure favorable pricing for our hotel owners for various
products and services or enhance resources for promotional campaigns co-sponsored by certain vendors. More specifically, unrestricted rebates are funds returned to the buyer, generally based upon volumes or quantities of goods purchased. Marketing
(restricted) allowances are funds allocated by vendor agreements for certain marketing or other joint promotional initiatives. Sponsorships are funds paid by vendors, generally used by the vendor to gain exposure at meetings and events, which are
accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the event.

We account for rebates and allowances as adjustments of the prices
of the vendors’ products and services. We show vendor costs and the reimbursement of those costs as reimbursed costs and cost reimbursements revenue, respectively; therefore, rebates are reflected as a reduction of these line items.

Cash and Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash, totaling $103 million and $153 million at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007,
respectively, is recorded in the “Other long-term assets” line in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held internationally that has not been repatriated due to accounting, statutory, tax
and foreign currency risks, and deposits received on timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential sales that are held in escrow until the contract is closed.

Assets Held for Sale

We consider properties (other than Timeshare segment interval,
fractional ownership, and residential products, which we classify as inventory) to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met:

•

management commits to a plan to sell a property;

•

it is unlikely that the disposal plan will be significantly modified or discontinued;



•

the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition;

•

actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated;

•

sale of the property is probable and we expect the completed sale will occur within one year; and

•

the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value.

Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property at the lower of its carrying value or its
estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we cease depreciation.

At year-end 2008, we had no assets held for
sale or liabilities related to assets held for sale.

Assets held for sale totaled $123 million at year-end 2007 and
consisted of property and equipment. The $123 million total reflected the following segment composition: North American Full-Service-$17 million; North American Limited-Service-$17 million; and Luxury-$89 million. There were no liabilities of assets
held for sale at year-end 2007.

In 2007, we reclassified the balances associated with one property, in conformity with
other “held and used” properties, as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as “held for sale.” In conjunction with that reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $4 million in 2007 that would
have been recognized in 2006 and $4 million in late 2007 that would have been recognized earlier in 2007 had the asset been continuously classified as “held and used.”

Loan Loss Reserves

Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans

We measure loan impairment based on the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the
recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the
purpose of applying such policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis.

Loans to Timeshare Owners

We record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable
that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes
receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable from 2004 forward. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales over the
life of those notes.

Valuation of Goodwill

We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other
circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain
growth projections, which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is greater than its estimated fair value.

Investments

We
consolidate entities that we control. We account for investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting when we exercise significant influence over the venture. If we do not exercise significant influence, we account for the
investment using the cost method of accounting. We account for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies using the equity method of accounting when we own more than a minimal investment. Our ownership interest in these
equity method investments varies generally from 10 percent to 50 percent.

The fair value of our available-for-sale
securities totaled $10 million and $55 million at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, respectively.

We included net unrealized holding (losses) gains on available-for-sale securities of ($10) million at year-end 2008 and $9 million at year-end
2007 in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of net (losses) gains reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the sale of



available-for-sale securities totaled ($2) million and $18 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. We determined the cost basis of the securities sold using
specific identification.

Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects

We charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. Selling and marketing costs
deferred were $7 million at year-end 2008 and $6 million at year-end 2007 and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in the “Other” caption within the “Current assets” section. If a contract is canceled, we
charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record deposits forfeited as income.

Residual Interests

We periodically sell notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval
and fractional products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests.
The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. We measure our servicing assets using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, we carry
servicing assets on the balance sheet at fair value and report the changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected cash flows, in earnings in the period in which
the change occurs. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as “trading” securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115. At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of
the residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these residual interests, including servicing assets, through the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

The most significant estimate involved in the measurement process is the discount rate, followed by the default rate and
the loan repayment rate. Estimates of these rates are based on management’s expectations of future prepayment rates and default rates, reflecting our historical experience, industry trends, current market interest rates, expected future
interest rates, and other considerations. Actual repayment rates, default rates, and discount rates could differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the
availability of alternative financing sources to borrowers. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced occurs more slowly than we project, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed
previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are lower than we expect, the carrying value of retained interests could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts.
Accordingly, the residual interests, including servicing assets, actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially recorded.

For additional information regarding residual interests, see Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” and Footnote No. 12, “Asset Securitizations.”

Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for
trading or speculative purposes.

We record all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities. We recognize,
currently in earnings, changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and of derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments. We record changes in the fair value of the hedged item in a fair value hedge as an
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognize the change in the fair value of the derivative in earnings in the same income statement line item.

We record the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments as a component of
other comprehensive income and report the ineffective portion currently in earnings. We reclassify amounts included in other comprehensive income into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings.

Foreign Operations

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating in the United States. The functional currency for our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating outside of the United States is
generally the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. For consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into U.S.
dollars, and we do the same, as needed, for unconsolidated entities whose functional currency is



not the U.S. dollar. We translate assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date, and income statement accounts are
translated using the weighted average exchange rate for the period. We include translation adjustments from foreign exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature as a separate
component of shareholders’ equity. We report gains and losses from foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment nature, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions, currently in operating costs and expenses, and those amounted to a $6 million loss in 2008, a $2 million loss in 2007, and a $6 million gain in 2006. Gains and other income for 2007 included $6 million attributable to currency
translation adjustment gains, net of losses, from the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of investments. There were no similar gains or losses in 2008.

New Accounting Standards

EITF
Issue No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums”

We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 06-8, “Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums” (“EITF 06-8”) on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year.
EITF 06-8 states that in assessing the collectibility of the sales price pursuant to paragraph 37(d) of FAS No. 66, an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyer’s initial and continuing investment to conclude that the sales price is
collectible. If an entity is unable to meet the criteria of paragraph 37, including an assessment of collectibility using the initial and continuing investment tests described in paragraphs 8 through 12 of FAS No. 66, then the entity should
apply the deposit method of accounting as described in paragraphs 65 through 67 of FAS No. 66.

Although our adoption
of EITF 06-8 had no impact on our wholly owned projects, in conjunction with the adoption of EITF 06-8 by one joint venture in which we are a partner, we recorded the cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8 as a reduction of $5 million to our
investment in that joint venture, an increase in deferred tax assets of $2 million, and a reduction of $3 million to the opening balance of our retained earnings. The application of the continuing investment criterion in EITF 06-8 on the
collectibility of the sales price could in certain future circumstances delay our ability, or the ability of joint ventures in which we are a partner, to recognize revenues and costs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”

We adopted FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS No. 157”), on December 29, 2007, the first day
of fiscal year 2008. FAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS
157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,” which amends FAS No. 157 by delaying its effective date by one year for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Therefore, beginning on December 29, 2007, this standard applied prospectively to new fair value measurements of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of
non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities. On January 3, 2009, the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year, the standard will also apply to all other fair value measurements. See Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” for
additional information.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities- Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

We adopted FAS No. 159, “The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“FAS No. 159”), on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. This standard permits but does
not require entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our financial assets or liabilities in 2008.

EITF Issue No. 07-6, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for
Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause”

We adopted EITF Issue No. 07-6,
“Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, ‘Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,’ When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause” (“EITF 07-6”), on December 29,
2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. EITF 07-6 clarifies whether a buy-sell clause is a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No. 66.



EITF 07-6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit, profit sharing,
leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy-sell clause performed in 2008 and thereafter. The adoption of EITF 07-6 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

FASB Staff Position FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 “Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and
Interests in Variable Interest Entities”

We adopted FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS No. 140-4 and
FIN 46(R)-8 “Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities” in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year-end. FSP FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 amends FAS
No. 140 to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transferors’ continuing involvements with transferred financial assets. It also amends FIN 46(R) to require public enterprises, including sponsors that have a
variable interest in a variable interest entity, to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest entities. The FSP also requires disclosures by a public enterprise that is a sponsor of a qualifying special-purpose
entity (“SPE”) that holds a variable interest in the qualifying SPE but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE and a servicer of a qualifying SPE that holds a significant variable interest in the qualifying SPE
but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE. FSP FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 is effective for year-end 2008 disclosures. The adoption of FSP FAS No. 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 did not have a material impact on our
financial statements.

FSP EITF 99-20-1 “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20, ‘Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets’”

We adopted FSP EITF 99-20-1 “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20, ‘Recognition of Interest Income
and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets,’” (“FSP EITF 99-20-1”) in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year-end. FSP
EITF 99-20-1 amends EITF Issue No. 99-20 to align the impairment guidance in EITF Issue No. 99-20 with that of FAS No. 115. FAS No. 115 measures impairment based on a determination of whether an other-than-temporary
impairment has occurred. Our residual interests in our asset securitizations are recorded at fair value each reporting period. Therefore, the adoption of FSP EITF 99-20-1 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Future Adoption of Accounting Standards

Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations”

On
December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“FAS No. 141(R)”). FAS No. 141(R) will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS
No. 141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Transaction costs will no longer be included in the
measurement of the business acquired. Instead, these costs will be expensed as they are incurred. FAS No. 141(R) also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB
No. 51”

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of ARB No. 51” (“FAS No. 160”). FAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of
a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent’s equity. The amount of net income attributable to
the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No. 160 clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are
equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the
fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. FAS No. 160 must be applied
prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year except for the presentation and



disclosure requirements, which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 160 will
have on our financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”

In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161,
“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS No. 161”). FAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosure related to derivatives and hedging activities and
thereby seeks to improve the transparency of financial reporting. Under FAS No. 161, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures relating to: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (b) how derivative
instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS No. 133”), and its related interpretations; and (c) how derivative
instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. FAS No. 161 must be applied prospectively to all derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments that are designated
and qualify as hedging instruments and related hedged items accounted for under FAS No. 133 for all financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009
fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 161 will have on our financial statements.

2.

INCOME TAXES

We adopted the
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), on December 30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we
recorded a $155 million increase in the net liability for unrecognized tax positions, which was recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital on December 30, 2006. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 was $141 million and $132 million, respectively. Included in the balances at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 were $87 million and $97 million, respectively, of tax positions that, if
recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.

The unrecognized tax benefit reconciliation from the beginning balance to
the ending balance is as follows:

In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. This policy did not change as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended January 2, 2009, and our Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of that date include interest of $42 million and $29 million, respectively. Our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 28, 2007, and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date include interest of $18
million and $8 million, respectively.

We file income tax returns, including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal,
state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are participating in the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”) for the 2008 and 2007 tax years and we intend to participate for 2009. This program
accelerates the examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is filed. Our federal income tax returns have been examined and we have settled all issues for tax years through 2004 with the exception of
one 1994 transaction discussed below. The 2005 and 2006 examinations have been completed, and the issues



from those years are now at the IRS Appeals Division. Various state, local, and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities.

In 2008, we recorded a $24 million income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain
foreign subsidiaries. We are contesting the issue with the IRS for tax years 2005 and 2006. In addition, we recorded a $19 million tax expense in 2008 due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that
resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction. The settlement resulted in a $26 million tax refund, which we received during 2008.

We also recorded, in 2008, a $29 million income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision
involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction. The tax had been paid, and we had filed a refund claim to recover the taxes. We have appealed the ruling.

For 2008, we increased unrecognized tax benefits by $97 million, including increases for the foreign subsidiaries issue as well as the
1994 tax planning transaction issue. For the same period, we decreased unrecognized tax benefits by $88 million related primarily to the settlement of the 1995 leasing transaction. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits was $141 million at
year-end 2008.

In 2007, we reached a settlement of issues raised during the IRS’ and Department of Labor’s
examination of the employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) feature of the Company’s Employees’ Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan (the “Plan”). The settlement resulted in an after-tax charge in 2007 totaling $54
million and a reduction in shareholders’ equity of $115 million. The $54 million charge included $35 million of excise taxes (impacting general, administrative, and other expense), $13 million of interest expense on those excise taxes, and $6
million of income tax expense primarily reflecting additional interest. As a result of the settlement, we have made cash payments to the U.S. Treasury and state tax jurisdictions of $206 million through year-end 2008. The payments reflect income
taxes, excise taxes, and interest charges. No penalties were assessed. For additional information regarding the Plan and the ESOP settlement, see Footnote No. 3, “Income Taxes,” in our 2007 Form 10-K.

As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. It is possible that the amount of the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 52-week period, but we do not anticipate that a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur.

Total deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, were as follows:

($ in millions)



Deferred tax assets

The tax effect of each type of temporary difference and carry-forward that gives
rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, were as follows:

We claimed approximately $6 million of tax credits in 2008 (treated them as a
reduction of 2008 Federal and Hawaii income taxes) associated with investment tax credits that arose in 2008 that we account for using the flow-through method in accordance with APB Opinion No. 4, “Accounting for the Investment
Credit.” At year-end 2008, we had approximately $10 million of tax credits that expire through 2028, of which $3 million are investment tax credits and $226 million of tax credits that do not expire. We recorded $24 million of net operating
loss benefits in 2008. At year-end 2008, we had approximately $749 million of net operating losses, of which $447 million expire through 2028.



We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes or additional foreign taxes on the
cumulative unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries ($911 million as of year-end 2008) because we consider these earnings to be permanently invested. These earnings could become subject to additional taxes if remitted as dividends, loaned to us
or a U.S. affiliate or if we sold our interests in the affiliates. We cannot practically estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on the unremitted earnings. We conduct business in countries that grant a “holiday” from
income taxes for 10- and 30-year periods. The holidays expire through 2034. The aggregate amount of taxes not incurred due to tax “holidays” and the related earnings per share impacts are $14 million ($0.04 per diluted share), $14 million
($0.04 per diluted share), and $22 million ($0.05 per diluted share) for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

The
(provision for) benefit from income taxes consists of:

The current tax provision does not reflect the benefits attributable to us
relating to the exercise or vesting of employee share-based awards of $21 million in 2008, $114 million in 2007, and $194 million in 2006. Included in the preceding table are tax credits of $9 million in 2008 and $4 million in each of 2007 and 2006.
The taxes applicable to other comprehensive income are not material.

A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory tax rate to
our effective income tax rate for continuing operations follows:

Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $220 million in 2008, $350 million
in 2007, and $169 million in 2006.

3.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS-SYNTHETIC FUEL

Our synthetic fuel operations consisted of four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities (the “Facilities”). Because tax credits under Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code are not available for the production and
sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar year-end 2007, and because we estimated that high oil prices during 2007 would result in the phase-out of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and
sold in 2007, on November 3, 2007, we shut down the Facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel. Accordingly, we now report this business as a discontinued operation.

The tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuels were established by Congress to
encourage the development of alternative domestic energy sources. Congress deemed that the incentives provided by the tax credits would not be necessary if the price of oil increased beyond certain thresholds as prices would then provide a more
natural market for these alternative fuels. As a result, the tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given calendar year



were phased out if the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for that year fell within a specified range. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate
of the annual average wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil and was determined for each calendar year by the Secretary of the Treasury by April 1 of the following year. The price range within which the credit was phased out was set in
1980 and was adjusted annually for inflation. In 2007, the Reference Price phase-out range was $56.78 to $71.27. Because the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2007 was within that range, at $66.52, there was a 67.2 percent reduction of the tax
credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007. Income from discontinued operations of $3 million in 2008, primarily reflected the recognition in 2008 of additional tax credits as a result of the determination by the Secretary of the
Treasury in 2008 of the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2007, partially offset by obligations based on the amount of additional tax credits. The determination resulted in a 67.2 percent reduction of tax credits for the 2007 fiscal year,
compared to the reduction of 70.7 percent that had been estimated and recorded in the 2007 fiscal year.

The following
tables provide additional income statement and balance sheet information relating to the discontinued synthetic fuel operations.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Under our
2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (“Stock Option Program”); (2) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) for our Class A Common Stock;
(3) restricted stock units of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.

For all share-based awards FAS No. 123(R) requires that we measure compensation costs related to our share-based
payment transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award.

During 2008 we granted 5.6 million restricted stock units (2.6 million, most of which were granted in February and had a weighted
average grant-date fair value of $35 per unit and 3.0 million were granted in August and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $26 per unit), 2.7 million Employee SARs (1.8 million, most of which were granted in February and had
a weighted average grant-date fair value of $13 per right and 0.9 million were granted in August and had a weighted average grant-date fair value of $10 per right), and 4,000 Non-employee SARs. During that time period, we also granted
approximately 218,000 stock options and issued 25,000 deferred stock units. The grants made in August would ordinarily have been made in February, 2009 but were accelerated to encourage associate retention in a difficult economic climate. Awards for
the most senior executives were not accelerated.

Under FAS No. 123(R), we recorded share-based compensation expense
related to award grants of $112 million in 2008, $104 million in 2007, and $108 million in 2006. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards



totaled $215 million at year-end 2008 and $162 million at year-end 2007, and the weighted average period over which we expect the deferred compensation costs
at year-end 2008 to be recognized is two years.

For share-based compensation grants that occur after the adoption of FAS
No. 123(R), (which for us was the first day of fiscal year 2006), FAS No. 123(R) requires that share-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the
employee providing additional service (the “substantive vesting period”). We continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested portion of awards granted prior to adoption of FAS No. 123(R) and follow the substantive
vesting period for awards granted after the adoption of FAS No. 123(R).

In accordance with FAS No. 123(R), we
present the tax benefits resulting from the exercise or vesting of share-based awards as financing cash flows. Tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based awards totaled $21 million, $114 million, and $194 million for 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively.

The aggregate amount of cash we received from the exercise of stock options granted under share-based
payment arrangements was $30 million, $89 million, and $184 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

We issue restricted stock units under the Comprehensive Plan to certain officers and key employees and those units vest
generally over four years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the restricted stock units over the service period equal to the fair market value of the stock units on the date of
issuance. Upon vesting, restricted stock units convert to shares and are distributed from treasury shares. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, we had approximately $192 million and $145 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related
to restricted stock units. Share-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units was $85 million, $82 million, and $77 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The weighted average remaining term for restricted stock unit
grants outstanding at year-end 2008 was two years. Restricted stock units converted and distributed during 2008, 2007, and 2006, had aggregate intrinsic values of $90 million, $147 million, and $78 million, respectively. The weighted average
grant-date fair values of restricted stock units granted in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $30, $49, and $35, respectively.

Changes in our outstanding restricted stock unit grants in 2008 were as follows:

Stock Options and SARs

Employee stock options may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of our
Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-qualified options generally expire 10 years after the date of grant, except those issued from 1990 through 2000, which expire 15 years after the date of the grant. Most stock options under the
Stock Option Program are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant.

We recognized compensation expense associated with employee stock options of $6 million in 2008, $12 million in 2007, and $22 million in 2006. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, there was approximately $2 million and
$6 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to employee stock options. Upon the exercise of stock options, we issue shares from treasury shares.



Changes in our outstanding Stock Option Program awards in 2008 were as follows:

Stock options issued under the Stock Option Program awards outstanding at year-end
2008, were as follows:

The number of options granted in the last three fiscal years and the associated
weighted average grant-date fair values and weighted average exercise prices are noted in the following table:

The total intrinsic value of options outstanding at year-end 2008 and year-end
2007 was $88 million and $636 million, respectively, and the total intrinsic value for stock options exercisable as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 was $95 million and $624 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options
exercised during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was approximately $42 million, $206 million, and $309 million, respectively.

Employee SARs may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. SARs generally expire 10 years after the date of grant and both
vest and are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. Non-employee SARs may be granted to directors at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of
our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-employee SARs generally expire 10 years after the date of grant and vest upon grant; however, they are generally not exercisable until one year after grant. We first began issuing SARs in 2006.
On exercise of SARs, employees or Non-employee directors receive the number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the number of SARs that are being exercised multiplied by the quotient of (a) the final value minus the base value,
divided by (b) the final value.

We recognized compensation expense associated with Employee SARs and Non-employee
SARs of $18 million in 2008, $5 million in 2007, and $3 million in 2006. At the end of 2008 and 2007, we had approximately $19 million and $7 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to SARs. Upon the exercise of SARs, shares
are issued from treasury shares.



The number of Employee SARs granted in the last three fiscal years and the associated
weighted average base values and weighted average grant-date fair values are noted in the following table:

The risk-free rates are based on the corresponding U.S. Treasury spot rates for
the expected duration at the date of grant, converted to a continuously compounded rate. Non-employee SARs were valued using assumptions within the ranges shown above for Employee SARs, except using an expected term of 10 years.

For Non-employee SARs issued in 2008, 2007, and 2006, the only differences in the assumptions versus employee SARs were the use of
risk-free interest rates of 3.9 percent, 4.6 percent, and 5.0 percent, respectively, and for each year’s issuances, an expected life of 10 years.

Estimated volatilities for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were based on the historical share-price volatility for a period equal to the stock option’s or SAR’s expected lives, ending on the day of grant, and
calculated based on weekly data. The weighted average expected stock option or SARs terms for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were a product of the lattice-based binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors to calculate the expected terms.

Deferred Stock Units

We also issue deferred stock units to Non-employee directors. These Non-employee director deferred stock units vest within one year and are distributed upon election. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, there was
approximately $203,000 and $227,000, respectively, in deferred costs related to Non-employee director deferred stock units.

The share-based compensation expense, number of deferred stock units granted, weighted average grant-date fair value, and aggregate intrinsic value of Non-employee director deferred stock units are noted in the following table:



At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, there were 233,000 and 218,000, respectively,
Non-employee deferred stock units outstanding, and the weighted average grant-date fair value of those outstanding deferred stock units was $24 for each of 2008 and 2007.

Other Information

Although the Comprehensive Plan also provides for issuance of
deferred stock bonus awards, deferred stock awards, and restricted stock awards, our Compensation Policy Committee indefinitely suspended the issuance of deferred bonus stock commencing with our 2001 fiscal year and the issuance of both deferred
stock awards and restricted stock awards commencing with the 2003 fiscal year. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, there was approximately $2 million and $4 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to these suspended award
programs, and the weighted average remaining term was one year for such award grants outstanding at year-end 2008. Share-based compensation expense associated with these suspended award programs was $2 million, $4 million, and $6 million for 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively.

At year-end 2008, 58 million shares were reserved under the Comprehensive Plan
including 39 million shares under the Stock Option Program and Stock Appreciation Right Program.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

We adopted
FAS No. 157 on December 29, 2007, the first day of fiscal year 2008. FAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under
GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FAS No. 157 details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value.

We have various financial instruments we must measure under FAS No. 157 including: certain marketable securities; derivatives; and
servicing assets and residual interests related to our asset securitizations. None of our current non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities must be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure our financial assets and liabilities
using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2
inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).

Level 3 includes unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability. We develop these inputs based on the best information available, including our own data.

In accordance with the
fair value hierarchy, the following table shows the fair value as of year-end 2008, of those financial assets and liabilities that we must measure at fair value and that we classify as “Other current assets,” “Other assets,” and
“Other long-term liabilities”:



As discussed in Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,”
we recorded impairment charges during 2008 for some of our inventory and intangible assets. In accordance with the guidance found in FSP No. FAS 157-2, we did not apply the provisions of FAS No. 157 to these impairments.

The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities for year-end 2008:

At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair
value of our residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. The implementation of FAS No. 157 did not result in material changes to the models or processes used to value these assets. These transactions may
utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest margin associated with the beneficial interest. The discount rates we use in determining the fair values of the residual interests are based on the general level of interest rates in the market
and the assumed credit risk of the interests retained. We adjust these discount rates quarterly as interest rates and credit spreads in the market vary.

We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and
accordingly, we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2008 we recorded trading losses of $9 million,
and in 2007 and 2006, we recorded trading gains of $30 million and $19 million, respectively.

During 2008, 2007, and 2006,
we used the following key assumptions to measure, at the date of sale, the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets: average discount rates of 9.23 percent, 9.02 percent, and 9.22 percent, respectively; average expected
annual prepayments, including defaults, of 24.01 percent, 25.02 percent, and 25.22 percent, respectively; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 76 months, 75 months, and 70 months
respectively; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months, 34 months, and 32 months, respectively. Our key assumptions are based on experience with notes receivable and
servicing assets.

We used the following key assumptions in measuring the fair value of the residual interests, including
servicing assets, in our 12 outstanding Timeshare note sales as of year-end 2008: an average discount rate of 16.87 percent; an average expected annual prepayment rate, including defaults, of 18.08 percent; an expected weighted average life of
prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 59 months; and an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months.

The most significant estimate involved in the measurement process is the discount rate, followed by the default rate and the loan
repayment rate. Estimates of these rates are based on management’s expectations of future prepayment rates and default rates, reflecting our historical experience, industry trends, current market interest rates, expected future interest rates,
and other considerations. Actual repayment rates, default rates, and discount rates could differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the availability of
alternative financing sources to borrowers. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced were to occur more slowly than had been projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed
previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are lower than expected, the carrying value of retained interests could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts.
Accordingly, the retained interests,



including servicing assets, actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially recorded. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced occur at a
faster pace than we have projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are higher than we expect, the
carrying value of retained interests could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. Accordingly, the retained interests, including servicing assets, actually realized, could differ from the amounts
initially recorded.

We completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, as
of the end of 2008 to measure the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. This methodology applied unfavorable changes that would be statistically significant for the key variables of prepayment rate,
discount rate, and weighted average remaining term. Before we applied any of these stress test changes, we determined that the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, was $221 million as of year-end 2008.

Applying the stress tests, we concluded that each change to a variable shown in the table below would have the following impact on the
valuation of our residual interests at year-end:

We value our derivatives using valuations that are calibrated to the initial trade
prices. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rates and volatilities. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivative instruments in gains from the sale of timeshare
notes receivable, which are recorded within the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we impaired one equity method investment and three other investments for a total of $25 million. Impairment charges of $9 million were recorded in “Equity in earnings” and
$16 million were recorded in “Gains and other income.” We used level three inputs in a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of these assets. For additional information, see the “Other Charges” caption of
Footnote No. 20, “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges.”

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The table below
illustrates the reconciliation of the earnings and number of shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

We compute the effect of dilutive securities using the treasury stock method and
average market prices during the period. We determine dilution based on earnings from continuing operations.

In accordance
with FAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share,” we have not included the following stock options and SARs in our calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices for the
applicable periods:

(a)

for the year ended January 2, 2009, 3.9 million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $31.05 to $49.03;

(b)

for the year ended December 28, 2007, 0.4 million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $45.91 to $49.03; and

(c)

for the year ended December 29, 2006, no options or SARs.

7.

INVENTORY

Inventory, totaling
$1,981 million and $1,557 million as of January 2, 2009, and December 28, 2007, respectively, consists primarily of Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products totaling $1,959 million and $1,536 million as of
January 2, 2009, and December 28, 2007, respectively. Inventory totaling $22 million and $21 million as of January 2, 2009, and December 28, 2007, respectively, primarily relates to hotel operating supplies for the limited number
of properties we own or lease. We value Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products at the lower of cost or net realizable value and generally value operating supplies at the lower of cost (using the first-in,
first-out method) or market. Consistent with recognized industry practice, we classify Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products inventory, which has an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months, as a current asset.

We recorded a pretax charge of $22 million in 2008 within the “Timeshare-direct” caption of our Consolidated
Statements of Income related to the impairment of a fractional and whole ownership real estate project held for development by a joint venture that we consolidate. We recorded a pretax benefit of $12 million in 2008 within the “Minority
interest” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income representing our joint venture partner’s pretax share of the $22 million impairment charge. Accordingly, the impact to our Timeshare segment was $10 million. We made the adjustment
in accordance with FAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” to adjust the carrying value of the real estate to our estimate of its fair value at year-end 2008. The downturn in market conditions
including contract cancellations and tightening in the credit markets, especially for jumbo mortgage loans, were the predominant items considered in our analysis. We estimated the fair value of the inventory utilizing a probability weighted cash
flow model containing our expectations of future performance discounted at a 10-year risk-free interest rate determined from the yield curve for U.S. Treasury instruments (3.68 percent).



We also recorded a pretax charge of $9 million in 2008 in the
“Timeshare-direct” caption of our Consolidated Statement of Income for write-downs of inventory due to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe (see the “Other Charges” caption of Footnote No. 20
“Restructuring Costs and Other Charges,” for additional information).

8.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

The
following table details the composition of our property and equipment balances at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007.

We record property and equipment at cost, including interest and real estate taxes
incurred during development and construction. Interest capitalized as a cost of property and equipment totaled $55 million in 2008, $49 million in 2007, and $32 million in 2006. We capitalize the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of
property and equipment when incurred. These capitalized costs may include structural costs, equipment, fixtures, floor, and wall coverings. We expense all repair and maintenance costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (three to 40 years), and we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset life or lease term. Depreciation expense totaled $155 million in 2008, $162 million in 2007, and $155
million in 2006.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

2008 Acquisitions

At year-end 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership and residential products.
In 2008, we purchased our partner’s interest in that joint venture together with additional land. Cash consideration for this transaction totaled $42 million and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $80 million and $38 million,
respectively, on the date of purchase. In 2008, we also purchased real estate for a timeshare project for a total purchase price of approximately $63 million. Cash consideration totaled approximately $39 million, and non-current liabilities recorded
as a result of this transaction were $24 million. In addition, in 2008, we purchased real estate for another timeshare project for cash consideration of $47 million. Also in 2008, we purchased units in an existing building for our timeshare
operations for cash consideration of approximately $14 million. We also purchased real estate for another timeshare project for $28 million. Cash consideration totaled approximately $27 million, and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $28
million and $1 million, respectively, on the date of purchase.

2008 Dispositions

In 2008, we sold, at book value, two limited-service properties and two land parcels for cash proceeds of $33 million, and we received a
$22 million equity interest in the entity that purchased one of the land parcels. We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66 and each property will continue to operate under our brands
pursuant to management or franchise agreements. Also, in 2008, we sold our interest in an entity that leases four hotels. In conjunction with that transaction, we received cash proceeds totaling $5 million, and the sales price of the investment
approximated its book value.

2007 Acquisitions

During 2007, we acquired one full-service property, one limited-service property, and one extended-stay property for cash consideration of
$199 million. These three properties were acquired in conjunction with a land assemblage for a large hotel complex that is still in the formative development stage. In addition, we acquired certain land parcels in 2007 for cash consideration of $52
million. Also during 2007, we acquired the fee simple interest in the improvements of three properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties for cash consideration of $58 million. The purchase included one
full-service property and two limited-service properties, which were each sold later in the same year.



During the first half of 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed
fractional ownership and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our partner’s interest in the joint venture for $6 million. In conjunction with that transaction, we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $90 million
and $84 million, respectively, on the date of the purchase. During the first half of 2007, we were party to another venture that was established to develop and market timeshare and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our
partner’s interest in that joint venture, and concurrent with this transaction, we purchased additional land and assets from our partner as well. Aggregate cash and notes payable issued for these transactions totaled $106 million, and we
acquired assets and liabilities totaling $182 million and $76 million, respectively, on the date of purchase.

2007 Dispositions

In 2007, we sold nine properties for cash proceeds of $601 million and recognized gains totaling $24 million. We continue
to operate eight of the nine properties under long-term agreements. We sold two parcels of land for $55 million in cash proceeds that were under development and recognized a gain of $2 million. We also sold the fee simple interest in the
improvements of three properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties, initially acquired in early 2007, for book value and received $58 million in cash proceeds. We continue to manage the properties under
long-term agreements. We accounted for each of the foregoing sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66. During the year, we also sold our interests in five joint ventures for cash proceeds of $30 million and recognized
gains totaling $13 million. We had other asset sales during the year, which generated proceeds totaling $1 million. Cash flows totaling $745 million for all the preceding dispositions in 2007 are reflected in the “Dispositions” line in our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

In 2007, we also sold land that was under development. Due to a contingency in the
sales contract, we accounted for this sale under the deposit method of FAS No. 66. Accordingly, the cash proceeds, totaling $90 million, were reflected in “Other investing activities” in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In
2008, the contingency was resolved and we recorded a gain of $1 million.

2006 Acquisitions

During 2006, we acquired one full-service property for $130 million including aggregate cash consideration of $46 million plus the
assumption of debt. In addition we acquired three other full-service properties for aggregate cash consideration of $134 million. We sold each of the four properties to third-party owners during the 2007 fiscal year.

2006 Dispositions

In
2006 we sold our interest in the 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC (“Whitbread”), which held 46 hotels consisting of more than 8,000 rooms and we received approximately $164 million in cash, net of transaction costs, which was
approximately equal to the investment’s book value. We continue to manage the hotels under the Marriott Hotels & Resorts and Renaissance Hotels & Resorts brands. We also sold our minority interest in five other joint ventures
during 2006 for cash proceeds of $64 million and recognized gains of $43 million. Additionally, one cost method investee redeemed the preferred stock we held for $81 million in cash consideration and we recognized income of $25 million on the
redemption.

During 2006 we also sold 10 full-service properties for cash proceeds of $487 million and recognized gains
totaling $14 million.

We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66 and continue to operate eight of the properties under long-term management agreements. The sold properties included
eight properties purchased in 2005 from CTF Holdings Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (collectively “CTF”). For additional information regarding the CTF transaction, see the “2005 Acquisitions” caption in Footnote No. 8,
“Acquisitions and Dispositions,” in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prior to the sale of one property, we reclassified balances associated with that property in conformity with other “held and used” properties, in the first
half of 2006 as the property was not expected to be sold within one year of its classification as “held for sale.” In conjunction with that reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $2 million in the first half of 2006 that
would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as “held and used.” Cash proceeds of $26 million for one hotel sold in 2006 are not reflected in the disposition proceeds of $487 million, as the proceeds were initially
recorded as a deposit because of a contingency, and impacted the “Other investing activities” section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows rather than “Dispositions.” The contingency was subsequently resolved and sale
accounting was achieved in 2006. Other asset sales generated cash proceeds of $2 million.

Late in 2006, we sold a 75
percent interest in a joint venture to a third party for its book value of $14 million. At the time of the sale, the joint venture’s only asset was a parcel of land. In conjunction with the sale, we made a $25 million bridge loan to the joint
venture, which matured in early 2007. Following the guidance found in EITF



98-8, “Accounting for Transfers of Investments That Are in Substance Real Estate,” and FAS No. 66 due to our continuing involvement with the
joint venture, we consolidated the joint venture for the period of time that the bridge loan was outstanding. The bridge loan was subsequently repaid and we account for our remaining interest in the joint venture under the equity method as required
by APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.”

In 1988, the
Company as landlord, entered into a 59-year ground lease with a lessee for land that was improved with a hotel that is owned by the lessee. The hotel was previously branded a Marriott property. The lease contained contractual rental increases over
the term of the lease and annual ground rent on the land totaled approximately $5 million in 2006. The lease also contained a provision that permitted the lessee, under certain circumstances, to purchase the land for a fixed price. We and the lessee
had various discussions in 2006 concerning the land as well as the hotel. During the 2006 second quarter, it became probable that none of the proposed transactions were acceptable to both parties and the lessee indicated its intent to exercise its
option to purchase the land. Accordingly, in the 2006 second quarter, we reclassified the land from the “Property and equipment” caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets to the “Assets held for sale” caption and recorded a $37
million non-cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value. We completed the sale of the land, at book value, to the lessee in 2007 and this transaction is reflected in the figures noted earlier for dispositions in 2007.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The
following table details the composition of our goodwill and other intangible assets at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007.

We capitalize costs incurred to acquire management, franchise, and license
agreements that are both direct and incremental. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the agreements, ranging from 15 to 30 years. We evaluate the carrying values of intangible assets for impairment under the
provisions of FAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Amortization expense totaled $35 million for each of 2008 and 2007 and $33 million in 2006. Our estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five
fiscal years is as follows: $29 million for 2009; $29 million for 2010; $28 million for 2011; $28 million for 2012; and $28 million for 2013. In 2008, following the guidance found in EITF 93-7, “Uncertainties Related to Income Taxes in a
Purchase Business Combination,” we recorded a net $46 million reduction of goodwill and a corresponding change to the related net deferred tax liability due to the resolution of tax-related matters and a change in management’s estimate of
tax basis related to the purchase method of accounting for the Renaissance brand acquisition in 1997.

11.

NOTES RECEIVABLE

The following
table details the composition of our notes receivable balances at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007.

We classify notes receivable due within one year as current assets in the caption
“Accounts and notes receivable” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, including $81 million and $68 million, as of year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, respectively, related to “Loans to timeshare owners.”

Notes receivable at year-end 2008 were due to us as follows: $96 million in 2009; $156 million in 2010; $72 million in 2011; $83 million
in 2012; $59 million in 2013; and $460 million thereafter. The 2008 notes



receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $21 million. The 2007 notes receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $25
million. Gains from the sale of notes receivable totaled approximately $16 million, $82 million, and $79 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans

We reflect interest income associated with “Lodging senior loans” and “Lodging mezzanine and other loans” in the
“Interest income” caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. For financial statement purposes we do not accrue interest on “Lodging senior loans” and “Lodging mezzanine and other loans” that are
impaired. At year-end 2008, our recorded investment in impaired “Lodging senior loans” and “Lodging mezzanine and other loans” was $157 million. We had a $113 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit
losses, leaving $44 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired “Lodging senior loans” and “Lodging mezzanine and other
loans” was $112 million and we had a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2008 and 2007, our average investment in
impaired loans totaled $135 million and $102 million, respectively.

The following table summarizes the activity related to
our “Lodging senior loans” and “Lodging mezzanine and other loans” notes receivable reserve for 2006, 2007, and 2008:

Loans to Timeshare Owners

At year-end 2008, the weighted average interest rate for our “Loans to timeshare owners” was 12.7 percent and the stated
interest rates associated with these loans ranged from zero to 19.5 percent. We reflect interest income associated with “Loans to timeshare owners” of $68 million, $50 million, and $41 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption. We do not record accrued interest on “Loans to timeshare owners” that are over 90 days past due. Our recorded investment in
“Loans to timeshare owners” on nonaccrual status at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 totaled $74 million and $59 million, respectively. We established the reserve for “Loans to timeshare owners” notes receivable in 2006 in
conjunction with the adoption of SOP 04-2.



The following table summarizes the activity related to our “Loans to timeshare
owners” notes receivable reserve for 2006, 2007, and 2008:

12.

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS

We
periodically sell, without recourse, through special purpose entities, notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all
proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests. The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after
paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. The executed transactions typically include minimal cash reserves established at time of sale as well as default and delinquency triggers, which are monitored on a monthly
basis. These special purpose entities are specifically excluded from the scope of FIN 46(R). As such, we have not assessed if we would be deemed the primary beneficiary of these entities and thus be required to consolidated them. Prior to the start
of the 2007 fiscal year, we measured servicing assets at the date of sale at their allocated previous carrying amount based on relative fair value, classified those assets as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No. 115, and recorded
those assets at amortized cost.

On December 30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007, we adopted FAS No. 156.
In conjunction with the adoption of FAS No. 156, we elected to subsequently measure our servicing assets using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, we carry servicing assets on the balance sheet at fair value, and report the
changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected cash flows, in earnings in the period in which the change occurs.

To determine the fair value of servicing assets, we use a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net
servicing income, which is based on the monthly fee we receive for servicing the securitized notes. We use market assumptions in the valuation model, including estimates of prepayment speeds, default rates, and discount rates. We have inherent risk
for changes in the fair value of the servicing asset but do not deem the risk significant and therefore, do not use other financial instruments to mitigate this risk.

Effective December 30, 2006, upon the remeasurement of our servicing assets at fair value, we recorded a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the 2007 beginning balance of retained earnings of $1 million after-tax ($2 million pretax) in our Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. Accordingly, servicing assets totaled $11 million at year-end 2006 and $13 million
on the first day of fiscal year 2007. At year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, servicing assets totaled $12 million and $15 million, respectively.

The table below reconciles the servicing assets balance at year-end 2006, to the beginning balance on December 30, 2006.

Principally represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time and changes in fair value
due to changes in key variables listed below.

Contractually specified servicing fees, late fees, and
ancillary fees earned for 2008, 2007, and 2006 totaled $6 million, $6 million, and $5 million, respectively, and were reflected within the changes in fair value to the servicing assets noted above.

In 2008, 2007, and 2006, we sold notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval
and fractional ownership products of $300 million, $520 million, and $530 million, respectively. The 2008, 2007, and 2006 note sales were made to newly formed trusts that, on the same day, issued $246 million, $520 million, and $530 million of the
trust’s notes, respectively. In connection with the sale of the notes receivable, we received net proceeds of $237 million in 2008, $515 million in 2007, and $508 million in 2006. We have included gains from the sales of timeshare notes
receivable totaling $16 million, net of $12 million of hedge ineffectiveness, in 2008, $81 million in 2007, and $77 million in 2006 within the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these special purpose entities is the value of our
residual interests and servicing assets.

We had residual interests of $221 million and $238 million, respectively, at
year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, which are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as other long-term receivables of $134 million and $157 million, respectively, and other current assets of $87 million and $81 million, respectively.

Cash flows between us and third-party purchasers during 2008, 2007, and 2006, were as follows: net proceeds to us from new
timeshare note sales of $237 million, $515 million, and $508 million, respectively; repurchases by us of defaulted loans (over 150 days overdue) of $56 million, $30 million, and $24 million, respectively; repurchases by us of other loans in 2006 of
$31 million; servicing fees received by us of $6 million, $6 million, and $5 million, respectively; and cash flows received from our retained interests of $96 million, $100 million, and $91 million, respectively.

At year-end 2008, $1,181 million of principal remained outstanding in 12 special purpose entities formed in connection with our timeshare
note sales. Delinquencies of more than 90 days at year-end 2008 amounted to $12 million. The impact to us from delinquencies is limited to our residual interests, which we value based on a discounted cash flow model, as discussed in Footnote
No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements.” In cases where we choose to repurchase defaulted loans, we have been able to resell timeshare units underlying the defaulted loans without incurring material losses.

See our discussion regarding asset securitizations in the “Cash from Operations” caption of the “Liquidity and Capital
Resources” section of this report and, also, see Footnote No. 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” in this report for further discussion of our servicing assets and residual interests.

Due to the deterioration in the credit markets during the fourth quarter of 2008, we decided to postpone our planned note sale until
2009.



13.

LONG-TERM DEBT

Our long-term debt
at year-end 2008 and year-end 2007 consisted of the following:

As of year-end 2008, all debt was unsecured.

We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) that provides for borrowings and letters of
credit and has supported our commercial paper program. The Credit Facility provides for $2.5 billion of aggregate borrowings at any one time, and expires on May 14, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed spread. Additionally, we pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating.

Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (“LCPI”), a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for bankruptcy on October 5, 2008, is one of the lenders under the Credit Facility, with a total
aggregate funding commitment of $96 million (3.8 percent) of the $2.5 billion in total commitments. LCPI did not fund its share of our fourth quarter 2008 draws under the Credit Facility, and we have no reason to expect that it will do so in the
future. Accordingly, the total current effective size of the Credit Facility is approximately $2.4 billion.

Until early in
the 2008 fourth quarter, we regularly issued short-term commercial paper primarily in the United States and, to a much lesser extent, in Europe. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the then-current demand for our commercial paper in each
of these markets, as we do not have purchase commitments from buyers. Disruptions in the financial markets in September 2008 significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market. Accordingly, in September 2008, we borrowed under the Credit
Facility to fund anticipated short-term commercial paper maturities and, to a lesser extent, other general corporate needs, including working capital and capital expenditures, and suspended issuing commercial paper. All of our previously issued
commercial paper has matured and been repaid. We anticipate issuing commercial paper when that market stabilizes and issuances can be made on favorable terms. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to
refinance it on a long-term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings
mature. Fluctuations in the commercial paper market have not affected our liquidity and we do not expect them to do so in the future, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.



Although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, we depend on
capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels and also to develop timeshare properties. Events over the past several months, including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies, have made the capital markets
increasingly volatile. See the “Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities” discussion in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this report for additional information regarding our Credit Facility.

In early 2008, we made a $94 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our outstanding Series E
Senior Notes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased $109 million of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $28 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired
debt’s purchase price of $77 million and its carrying amount of $105 million. The weighted average interest rate on the senior debt that was paid down in 2008 was 6.4 percent.

Aggregate debt maturities at year-end 2008 were: $120 million in 2009; $71 million in 2010; $22 million in 2011; $1,327 million in 2012;
$409 million in 2013; and $1,146 million thereafter.

Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $110 million
in 2008, $115 million in 2007, and $73 million in 2006.

14.

SELF-INSURANCE RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

The activity in the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is summarized as follows:

The provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $4 million
and $34 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a result of changes in estimates from insured events of the prior years due to changes in underwriting experience and frequency and severity trends. The year-end 2008 self-insurance reserve of $296
million is comprised of a current portion of $92 million and long-term portion of $204 million. The year-end 2007 self-insurance reserve of $274 million is comprised of a current portion of $92 million and long-term portion of $182 million.

15.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Eight
hundred million shares of our Class A Common Stock, with a par value of $.01 per share, are authorized, and 10 million shares of preferred stock, without par value, are authorized. As of year-end 2008, there were 349.6 million shares
of our Class A Common Stock outstanding and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding.

Accumulated other
comprehensive loss of $15 million at year-end 2008 primarily consisted of losses totaling $10 million associated with available-for-sale securities and losses totaling $13 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments, partially
offset by net gains of $8 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive income of $51 million at year-end 2007 primarily consisted of gains totaling $9 million associated with
available-for-sale securities and gains totaling $46 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by net losses of $4 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges.



16.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We believe that the fair values of current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts. The fair values of non-current financial assets, liabilities, and derivatives are shown in the following table.

We value notes and other receivables based on the expected future cash flows
discounted at risk-adjusted rates. We determine valuations for long-term debt and other long-term liabilities based on quoted market prices or expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates.

17.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We use
derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or
speculative purposes.

During 2007, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage the volatility of the U.S.
Treasury component of the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of our Series I and Series J Senior Notes. During 2006, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage the volatility of the U.S. Treasury component of
the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of our Series H Notes. All three swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS
No. 133”) and were terminated upon pricing of the notes. All three swaps were highly effective in offsetting fluctuations in the U.S. Treasury component. Thus, there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings during 2007, or 2006. The
net losses for these swaps were $4 million in 2007 associated with the Series I and Series J Senior Notes, and zero in 2006 associated with the Series H notes. The net losses were recorded in other comprehensive income and are being amortized to
interest expense using the interest method over the life of the notes.

At year-end 2008, we had four outstanding interest
rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and/or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to
protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $111 million, and they expire through 2022. These swaps are not accounted for as hedges under FAS No. 133. The fair value of the swaps was a net
liability of $2 million at year-end 2008 and a net asset of $2 million at year-end 2007. For the outstanding interest rate swaps, we recorded a $4 million net loss during 2008, a $3 million net loss during 2007, and a $1 million net loss during
2006.

During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with
forecasted timeshare note sales. During 2008, eleven swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No. 133. The swaps were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations through the third quarter. In 2008, we terminated nine of
those eleven swaps and recognized a $6 million loss in Timeshare sales and services revenue. During the fourth quarter, two of the hedges became ineffective and we recorded a $12 million charge in Timeshare sales and services revenue. The aggregate
notional amount of the remaining two swaps is $149 million at year-end 2008 and they expire in 2012. The fair value of the remaining two swaps was a net liability of $13 million at year-end 2008. During 2007, five swaps were designated as cash flow
hedges under FAS No. 133 and were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. The amount of the ineffectiveness was immaterial. In 2007, we terminated two of those five swaps and recognized no gain or loss from the sales of
Timeshare segment notes receivable. The fair value of the remaining three swaps was a net liability of $7 million at year-end 2007. For the outstanding interest rate swaps, we recorded in 2007 a $7 million net loss in other comprehensive income.
During 2006, two swaps (the “2006 swaps”) were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No. 133 and were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. In 2006, we terminated the 2006 swaps and recognized a net gain of $1
million in the gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable.

During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we entered into
forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of the contracts



was $190 million at year-end 2008 and they expire in 2009. The forward exchange contracts do not qualify as hedges in accordance with FAS No. 133. The
fair value of the forward contracts to hedge monetary assets was zero at year-end 2008 and an asset of $2 million at year-end 2007. We recorded a $7 million gain during 2008, a $10 million loss during 2007, and a $34 million loss in 2006, relating
to these forward foreign exchange contracts. The net gains and losses for all years were recorded as general, administrative, and other expense and were offset by income and losses recorded from translating the related monetary assets denominated in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.

During 2007 and 2006, we entered into foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the
potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates. These contracts have terms of less than one year and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair values are recorded as a component
of other comprehensive income. The fair value of the option contracts was approximately $1 million at year-end 2007. During 2008, we recognized a $1 million loss related to the termination of contracts that we entered into during prior years. The
hedges were highly effective and there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings for 2007 and 2006 due to ineffectiveness.

During 2008 and 2007, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts and fees denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was
$89 million at year-end 2008. These contracts have terms of less than three years and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of the forward contracts
was $4 million at year-end 2008 and zero at year-end 2007. The hedges were highly effective and there was no gain or loss, impacting our general, administrative, and other expenses, reported in earnings for 2008 or 2007 due to ineffectiveness.
During 2008, we recorded a $1 million loss, impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, related to points paid to enter into these contracts. As of year-end 2008, the deferred gains and losses on existing contracts accumulated in other
comprehensive income that we expect to reclassify into earnings over future periods is $6 million.

During 2008, 2007, and
2006, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts offset the gains and losses associated with translation adjustments for
various investments in foreign operations. Certain contracts were designated as hedges in the net investment of a foreign operation under FAS No. 133. These hedges were highly effective and resulted in a net gain of $1 million for 2008, a net
loss of $1 million for 2007, and no net gain or loss for 2006 in the foreign currency translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income. Due to contract terminations in 2008, $1 million that was originally recorded in other comprehensive
income was recognized through earnings as a loss. The investments remaining at year-end 2008 had an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $15 million and a fair value of zero. No contracts remained at year-end 2007. One contract
remained at year-end 2006, which had an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $43 million and a fair value of zero. Certain other contracts did not qualify as hedges under FAS No. 133 and resulted in no gain or loss for 2007 and
a loss of $17 million for 2006, impacting our general, administrative, and other expenses.

During 2007 and 2006, in
response to high oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the potential phase out of tax credits, we entered into oil price hedges in conjunction with our synthetic fuel operation. These hedges do not qualify as cash flow hedges under FAS
No. 133. Therefore, changes in the fair values of these instruments are marked-to-market through interest income at each reporting period. Correspondingly, we recorded a net loss of $8 million during 2007 and a net loss of $2 million during
2006. At year-end 2007, hedges with a total fair value of $4 million remained outstanding.

During 2003, we entered into an
interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The
aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. The swap is classified as a fair value hedge under FAS No. 133 and we recognize the change in the fair value of the swap, as well as the change in the fair value of
the underlying note receivable, in interest income. The fair value of the swap was a $5 million liability at year-end 2008, a $2 million liability at year-end 2007, and a $1 million asset at year-end 2006. The hedge is highly effective and,
therefore, no net gain or loss was reported during 2008, 2007, and 2006.



18.

CONTINGENCIES

Guarantees

We issue guarantees to certain lenders and hotel owners primarily to obtain long-term management contracts. The guarantees generally have
a stated maximum amount of funding and a term of three to 10 years. The terms of guarantees to lenders generally require us to fund if cash flows from hotel operations are inadequate to cover annual debt service or to repay the loan at the end of
the term. The terms of the guarantees to hotel owners generally require us to fund if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. Guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans repayable to us
out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. We also enter into project completion guarantees with certain lenders in conjunction with hotels and Timeshare segment properties that we or our joint venture partners are
building.

The maximum potential amount of future fundings for guarantees where we are the primary obligor and the carrying
amount of the liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2008, are as follows:

The liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2008, is included in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: $3 million in the “Other payables and accruals” line item and $32 million in the “Other long-term liabilities” line item.

Our guarantees of $298 million listed in the preceding table include $33 million of operating profit guarantees that will not be in
effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties, along with $3 million of debt service guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying debt has been funded.

The guarantees of $298 million in the preceding table do not include $206 million of guarantees that we anticipate will expire in the
years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations totaling $145 million and lifecare bonds of $61 million for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise”) is the primary obligor of the
leases and $9 million of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (“CNL”), which subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of $50 million of the lifecare bonds. Five Star is the
primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise
and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. While we currently do not expect to fund under the guarantees, according to recent SEC filings made by
Sunrise there has been a significant deterioration in Sunrise’s financial position and access to liquidity; accordingly, Sunrise’s continued ability to meet these guarantee obligations cannot be assured.

The table also does not include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group
N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $6 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $67 million. Most of these obligations expire at the end of 2023. CTF Holdings Ltd.
(“CTF”) had originally made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees (approximately €7 million [$10 million] remained at year-end 2008). As CTF obtains
releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $67 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any
amounts under these guarantees in the future.

In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table , we have
provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and
we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. At year-end 2008, the carrying value of the liabilities
associated with this project completion guarantee was $6 million. We have provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $460 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project
will be satisfied by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our



partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 20 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. At year-end
2008, the carrying value of the liabilities associated with this project completion guarantee was $3 million.

In addition
to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for
loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions.

Commitments and
Letters of Credit

In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2008, we had extended approximately
$10 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $8 million, which expire within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire in one year.

At year-end 2008, we also had commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships
that plan to purchase North American full-service and limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel-anchored mixed-use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $34 million within three years; and $10 million after three years. Of the
$44 million in commitments, we expect to fund $29 million within one to two years and $15 million within three years. In addition, as of year-end 2008, we had commitments, with no expiration date, to fund up to $25 million in joint ventures for
development of new properties of which we expect to fund $13 million within one year and $12 million in one to two years. Also, as of year-end 2008, we had a commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $8 million in a joint venture of which
we have funded $1 million and have $7 million remaining that we do not expect to fund. And, as of year-end 2008, we had a commitment to invest up to $28 million (€20 million) in a joint venture in which we are a partner. We do not expect to
fund under this commitment.

At year-end 2008, we had $126 million of letters of credit outstanding, the majority of which
related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2008, totaled $465 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and
self-insurance programs.

Investment in Leveraged Lease

Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta Airlines”),
which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $17 million in 2005 and $1 million in 2006. We recorded an additional $5
million loss related to this investment in fiscal 2007, and have no remaining exposure.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We are a
diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments:

•

North American Full-Service Lodging

, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, JW Marriott Hotels &
Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport properties located in the continental United States and Canada;

•

North American Limited-Service Lodging

, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott
ExecuStay properties located in the continental United States and Canada;

•

International Lodging

, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts,
Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada;

•

Luxury Lodging

, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts properties worldwide (together with adjacent residential projects
associated with some Ritz-Carlton Hotels), as well as Edition, for which no properties are yet open; and

•

Timeshare

, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences, Grand Residences
by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide.



In addition to the segments above, in 2007, we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a
separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations.

We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the
results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, income taxes, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments.
Because note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results. We also include interest income associated with Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing
sales are an integral part of that segment’s business. Additionally, we allocate other gains or losses, equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures, divisional general, administrative, and other expenses, and minority interests in
income or losses of consolidated subsidiaries to each of our segments. “Other unallocated corporate” represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or
losses that are not allocable to our segments.

We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American
Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and
our organizational and management reporting structure.

Revenues



We allocate net minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries to our segments. Accordingly, as
of year-end 2008, we allocated net minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as shown in the following table:

Minority Interest



Equity Method Investments

Segment expenses include selling expenses directly related to the operations of the businesses,
aggregating $629 million in 2008, $616 million in 2007, and $600 million in 2006. Approximately 89 percent for each of 2008 and 2007 and 90 percent for 2006 of the selling expenses are related to our Timeshare segment.

The consolidated financial statements include the following related to operations located outside the United States (which are predominately related to
our International lodging segment): Revenues of $2,230 million in 2008, $2,287 million in 2007, and $1,869 million in 2006; segment financial results of $253 million in 2008 (13 percent from Europe, 36 percent from the Americas excluding the United
States, 23 percent from Asia, 12 percent from the United Kingdom, 13 percent from the Middle East and Africa, and 3 percent from Australia), $341 million in 2007, and $298 million in 2006; and fixed assets of $314 million in 2008 and $257 million in
2007. At year-end 2008 and at year-end 2007, fixed assets located outside the United States are included within the “Property and equipment” caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. No individual country, other than the United States,
constitutes a material portion of our revenues, financial results or fixed assets.

We estimate that, for the 20-year period from 2009
through 2028, the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $3.5 billion.



20.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND OTHER CHARGES

During the
latter part of 2008, we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result, in part, of the recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our capital intensive Timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and particularly the significant deterioration in the credit
markets, which resulted in our decision not to complete a note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008. These declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, and
anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. We responded by implementing certain company-wide cost-saving measures with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further cost saving measures. Upper-level management
responsible for the Timeshare segment, hotel operations, development, and above-property level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives. The various initiatives
resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of $55 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also incurred other charges, including charges for guarantees and reserves for loan losses, and inventory write-downs on Timeshare inventory,
reserves on accounts receivable, contract cancellation allowances, a charge related to the valuation of Timeshare residual interests, a charge associated with hedge ineffectiveness related to Timeshare note sale hedges, and asset impairments and
other charges, detailed further in “Other Charges.”

As part of the restructuring efforts in our Timeshare segment, we reduced
and consolidated sales channels in the United States and closed down certain operations in Europe. We recorded Timeshare restructuring costs of $28 million in the 2008 fourth quarter, including: (1) $14 million in severance costs; (2) $5
million in facilities exit costs, primarily associated with noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income arising from the reduction in personnel; and (3) $9 million related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to
development projects no longer deemed viable. We expect to complete this restructuring by year-end 2009.

As part of the hotel development
restructuring efforts across several of our Lodging segments, we discontinued certain development projects that required our investment. We recorded restructuring costs in the 2008 fourth quarter of $24 million, including: (1) $2 million in
severance costs; and (2) $22 million related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to development projects that we discontinued, including capitalized costs related to owned development of Renaissance ClubSport. We expect to complete
this restructuring by year-end 2009.

We also implemented restructuring initiatives by reducing above-property level lodging management
personnel and corporate overhead. We incurred 2008 fourth quarter restructuring costs of $3 million primarily reflecting severance costs. We expect to complete this restructuring by year-end 2009.

We have provided detailed information related to these restructuring costs and other charges below.

Restructuring Costs

Severance

These various restructuring initiatives resulted in an overall reduction of 1,021 employees (the majority of whom were terminated by
January 2, 2009) across the Company. We recorded a total workforce reduction charge of $19 million related primarily to severance and fringe benefits, which consisted of $14 million for the Timeshare segment, $2 million related to hotel
development, and $3 million related to above-property level lodging management and corporate overhead. The charge does not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for property-level severance costs. We also delayed filling vacant positions
and reduced staff hours. In connection with these initiatives, we expect to incur an additional $3 million to $4 million related to severance and fringe benefits in 2009 for the Timeshare segment.

Facilities Exit Costs

As a result of
workforce reductions and delays in filling vacant positions that were part of the Timeshare segment restructuring, we ceased using certain leased facilities. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $5 million associated with these
facilities, primarily related to noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income. In connection with these initiatives, in 2009, we expect to incur an additional $2 million to $3 million related to ceasing use of additional
noncancelable leases.



Development Cancellations

We sometimes incur certain costs associated with the development of hotel and timeshare properties, including legal costs, the cost of
land, and planning and design costs. We capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed. As a result of the sharp downturn in the economy, we decided to discontinue certain development
projects that required our investment, including our Renaissance ClubSport real estate development activities. These cancellations do not impact the two Renaissance ClubSport properties that are currently open. As a result of these development
cancellations, we expensed $31 million of previously capitalized costs, which consisted of $9 million of costs for the Timeshare segment and $22 million of costs related to hotel development. We do not currently expect to expense any additional
capitalized costs in 2009 in connection with these restructuring initiatives.

Other Charges

Charges for Guarantees and Reserves for Loan Losses

We sometimes issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with some financing transactions and other obligations. We also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage. As a result of
the downturn in the economy, certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners may not be able to meet debt service obligations to us, or in some cases, to third-party lending institutions. In addition, we expect
profit levels at a few hotels to drop below guaranteed levels. As a result, based on cash flow projections, we expect to fund under some of our guarantees, which we do not deem recoverable, and we expect that one of the loans made by us will not be
repaid according to its original terms. Due to the expected fundings under guarantees that we deemed nonrecoverable, we recorded charges of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the “General, administrative, and other” expenses
caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Due to the expected loan loss, we recorded a charge of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the “Provision for loan losses” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Timeshare Inventory Write-downs

As a result of terminating certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, we recorded an inventory write-down of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. We recorded this charge in the
“Timeshare-direct” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Accounts Receivable-Bad Debts

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reserved $4 million of accounts receivable, which we deemed uncollectible, generally as a result of the
unfavorable hotel operating environment, following an analysis of those accounts. We recorded this charge in the “General, administrative, and other” expenses caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Timeshare Contract Cancellation Allowances

Our financial statements reflect net contract cancellation allowances totaling $12 million recorded in the 2008 fourth quarter in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue and cost previously recorded for
certain projects under the percentage-of-completion method will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing. We have an equity method investment in one of these projects, and reflected $7 million of the $12 million in the
“Equity in earnings” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining net $5 million of contract cancellation allowances consisted of a reduction in revenue, net of adjustments to product costs and other direct costs, and
was recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue, net of direct costs.

Timeshare Residual Interests Valuation

The fair market value of our residual interest in timeshare notes sold declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to an increase
in the market rate of interest at which we discount future cash flows to estimate the fair market value of the retained interests. The increase in the market rate of interest reflects deteriorating economic conditions and disruption in the credit
markets, which significantly increased the borrowing costs to issuers. As a result of this change, we recorded a $32 million charge in “Timeshare sales and services” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income to reflect the decrease
in the fair value of these residual interests.

Timeshare Hedge Ineffectiveness

Given the significant deterioration in the credit markets, we expect that any potential note sale transactions pursued by the Company in
the near term will be materially different from arrangements originally contemplated,



and accordingly, the sensitivity of a hedge the Company previously entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted note sales no longer
significantly corresponds to the sensitivity in expected note sale proceeds. Differences include expected legal structures, modifications to priority of cash flow, and higher costs. The change in terms (inputs) used to determine hedge effectiveness
for Timeshare’s note sale hedges resulted in the recognition of $12 million in hedge ineffectiveness. We recorded this hedge ineffectiveness as a reduction in note sale gains in the “Timeshare sales and services” caption in our
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Asset Impairments and Other Charges

One project that is in development and in which the Company has a joint venture investment was unable to draw on existing financing
commitments as a result of the recent turmoil in the capital markets and the bankruptcy of the project’s major lender. As a result, based on our analysis of expected future cash flows, we determined that our investment in that joint venture was
fully impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge of $9 million in the “Equity in earnings” caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

In addition, as a result of the economic downturn and the inability of certain developers to obtain financing, we also recorded write-offs of other assets ($12 million) related to development costs associated with
projects we no longer deem probable in the “General, administrative, and other” expenses caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We also deemed certain cost method tax investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired because we do not expect to receive any future economic benefit from these investments. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment
charge of $9 million for those investments in the “Gains and other income” caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Summary of Restructuring Costs and Other Charges

The following table is a summary of the restructuring
costs and other charges we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as our remaining liability at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 and remaining restructuring costs expected to be incurred in 2009 as part of these restructuring
initiatives:



We anticipate that the remaining liability related to the workforce reduction will be substantially paid
by the end of 2009 for the Timeshare segment, by the end of 2009 for hotel development, and by the end of 2009 for above-property level management. The amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of
facilities in the Timeshare segment will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012. The remaining liability related to expected fundings under guarantees will likely be substantially paid by year-end 2010. The following tables provide
further detail on these charges, including a breakdown by segment:

2008 Operating Income Impact

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” we analyze our variable interests including loans, guarantees, and equity investments, to determine if the entity that
is party to the variable interest is a variable interest entity. Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. Quantitative analysis is based on the forecasted cash flows of the entity. Qualitative analysis is based on our review
of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision making ability, and financial agreements. Quantitative and qualitative analyses are also used to determine if we must consolidate a variable interest entity as the primary
beneficiary.

We have an equity investment in and a loan receivable due from a variable interest entity that develops and
markets fractional ownership and residential interests, and we consolidate the entity as we are the primary beneficiary. The loan we provided to the entity replaced the original senior loan and at year-end 2008 had a balance of $68 million and
accrued interest of $15 million. The loan facility is utilized to fund net cash flow of the variable



interest entity. The outstanding principal balance increased by $32 million compared to year-end 2007. At year-end 2008, the carrying amount of consolidated
assets included within our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are collateral for the variable interest entity’s obligations totaled $103 million and comprised $101 million of real estate held for development, property, equipment, and other
long-term assets, and $2 million of cash. Further, at year-end 2008, the carrying amount of consolidated liabilities included within our Consolidated Balance Sheet relative to this variable interest entity totaled $17 million. The creditors of the
variable interest entity do not have general recourse to our credit.

We utilize several special purpose entities to
maintain ownership of real estate in certain jurisdictions in order to facilitate sales within the Asia Pacific Points Club. Although we have no equity ownership in the Club itself, we absorb the variability in the assets of the club to the extent
that inventory has not been sold to the ultimate Club Member. We determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities based upon the proportion of variability that we absorb compared to Club Members. At year-end 2007
and 2008, the carrying amount of inventory associated with these variable interest entities was $18 million and $78 million, respectively. The creditors of the special purpose entities do not have general recourse to our credit.

In conjunction with the transaction with CTF described more fully in Footnote No. 9, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,”
under the caption “2005 Acquisitions” in our 2007 Form 10-K, we manage certain hotels on behalf of four tenant entities 100 percent owned by CTF, which lease the hotels from third-party owners. Due to certain provisions in the management
agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. At year-end 2008, the number of hotels totaled 14. The entities have minimal equity and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital. In conjunction with the 2005 transaction, CTF
had placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. In turn, we released CTF from their guarantees in connection with these properties. The terms of the trust require that the cash flows for the four tenant
entities be pooled for purposes of making rent payments and determining cash flow shortfalls. At year-end 2008, the trust account held approximately $28 million. The entities are variable interest entities under FIN 46(R). We do not consolidate the
entities because we do not bear the majority of the expected losses. We are secondarily liable (after exhaustion of funds from the trust account) for rent payments for eight of the 14 hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls. Future
minimum lease payments through the end of the lease term for these eight hotels totaled approximately $94 million. In addition, we are also secondarily liable for rent payments of up to an aggregate cap of $37 million for the six other hotels in the
event that there are cash flow shortfalls.

22.

LEASES

We have summarized our future obligations
under operating leases at year-end 2008, below:

Most leases have initial terms of up to 20 years and contain one or more renewal
options, generally for five- or 10-year periods. These leases provide for minimum rentals and additional rentals based on our operations of the leased property. The total minimum lease payments above include $382 million, representing obligations of
consolidated subsidiaries that are non-recourse to us.

Minimum lease payments aggregating $131 million relating to the CTF
leases further discussed in Footnote No. 21, “Variable Interest Entities,” which are not reflected in the $1,717 million in the preceding table are as follows: $29 million in each of 2009 and 2010; $25 million in 2011; $16 million in
2012; $9 million in 2013; and $23 million thereafter.



The composition of rent expense for the last three fiscal years associated with operating
leases is detailed in the following table:

Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)), and management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable
assurance regarding management’s control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based upon the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
