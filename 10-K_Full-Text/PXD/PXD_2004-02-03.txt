     Parts I and II of this annual  report on Form 10-K (the  "Report")  contain
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, no
assurances  can be  given  that  the  actual  events  and  results  will  not be
materially  different  than the  anticipated  results  described  in the forward
looking   statements.   See  "Item  1.  Business  -  Competition,   Markets  and
Regulations" and "Item 1. Business - Risks Associated with Business  Activities"
for a description of various factors that could materially affect the ability of
Pioneer Natural Resources  Company to achieve the anticipated  results described
in the forward-looking statements.

Definitions of Oil and Gas Terms and Conventions Used Herein

     Within this Report,  the following oil and gas terms and  conventions  have
specific  meanings:  "Bbl" means a standard  barrel  containing 42 United States
gallons;  "BOE" means a barrel of oil  equivalent  and is a standard  convention
used to express oil and gas volumes on a comparable oil equivalent basis;  "Btu"
means British  thermal unit and is a measure of the amount of energy required to
raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit; "LIBOR" means
London Interbank Offered Rate, which is a market rate of interest; "MMBtu" means
one million Btus; "MBbl" means one thousand Bbls; "MBOE" means one thousand BOE;
"MMBOE"  means one million  BOE;  "Mcf" means one  thousand  cubic feet and is a
measure of natural gas volume;  "MMcf" means one million cubic feet; "Bcf" means
one billion cubic feet;  "NGL" means  natural gas liquid;  "NYMEX" means The New
York Mercantile  Exchange;  "proved  reserves" mean the estimated  quantities of
crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering
data  demonstrate  with  reasonable  certainty to be recoverable in future years
from known reservoirs under existing  economic and operating  conditions,  i.e.,
prices  and  costs  as  of  the  date  the  estimate  is  made.  Prices  include
consideration  of  changes  in  existing  prices  provided  only by  contractual
arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions.
     (i) Reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported
by  either  actual  production  or  conclusive  formation  test.  The  area of a
reservoir considered proved includes (A) that portion delineated by drilling and
defined by gas-oil and/or  oil-water  contacts,  if any; and (B) the immediately
adjoining  portions  not yet  drilled,  but  which can be  reasonably  judged as
economically  productive on the basis of available  geological  and  engineering
data.  In the  absence  of  information  on fluid  contacts,  the  lowest  known
structural  occurrence  of  hydrocarbons  controls the lower proved limit of the
reservoir.
     (ii) Reserves  which can be produced  economically  through  application of
improved  recovery  techniques  (such as fluid  injection)  are  included in the
"proved"  classification  when  successful  testing by a pilot  project,  or the
operation of an installed  program in the  reservoir,  provides  support for the
engineering analysis on which the project or program was based.
     (iii)  Estimates of proved  reserves do not include the following:  (A) oil
that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified  separately as
"indicated  additional  reserves";  (B) crude oil,  natural gas, and natural gas
liquids,  the  recovery  of which is  subject  to  reasonable  doubt  because of
uncertainty as to geology, reservoir  characteristics,  or economic factors; (C)
crude oil,  natural gas,  and natural gas  liquids,  that may occur in undrilled
prospects;  and (D) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, that may be
 recovered from oil shales, coal, gilsonite and other such sources.

     "Standardized  Measure"  means the  after-tax  present  value of  estimated
future net revenues of proved reserves,  determined in accordance with the rules
and  regulations of the United States  Securities and Exchange  Commission  (the
"SEC"),  using prices and costs in effect at the specified date and a 10 percent
discount rate; "acquisition and finding cost per BOE" means total costs incurred
divided  by the  summation  of proved  reserves  attributable  to  revisions  of
previous  estimates,  purchases of  minerals-in-place  and new  discoveries  and
extensions;   and  "reserve  replacement   percentage"  means,  expressed  as  a
percentage,   the  summation  of  annual  proved  reserves,   on  a  BOE  basis,
attributable to revisions of previous estimates,  purchases of minerals-in-place
and new discoveries and extensions divided by annual production of oil, NGLs and
gas, on a BOE basis.

     Gas equivalents are determined  under the relative energy content method by
using the ratio of 6.0 Mcf of gas to 1.0 Bbl of oil or NGL.

     With  respect to  information  on the working  interest in wells,  drilling
locations and acreage,  "net" wells, drilling locations and acres are determined
by multiplying  "gross" wells,  drilling  locations and acres by Pioneer Natural
Resources Company's working interest in such wells, drilling locations or acres.
Unless otherwise  specified,  wells,  drilling  locations and acreage statistics
quoted  herein  represent  gross wells,  drilling  locations or acres;  and, all
currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars.







                                     PART I

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

General

     Pioneer  Natural  Resources  Company  (the  "Company"  or  "Pioneer")  is a
Delaware  corporation  whose  common  stock is listed and traded on the New York
Stock Exchange.  Pioneer is an oil and gas  exploration  and production  company
with ownership interests in oil and gas properties located in the United States,
Argentina, Canada, Gabon, South Africa and Tunisia.

     The  Company's  executive  offices are located at 5205 N.  O'Connor  Blvd.,
Suite  900,  Irving,  Texas  75039.  The  Company's  telephone  number  is (972)
444-9001.  The Company maintains other offices in Midland,  Texas; Buenos Aires,
Argentina;   Calgary,  Canada;  Capetown,  South  Africa;  Tunis,  Tunisia;  and
Libreville, Gabon. At December 31, 2003, the Company had 1,014 employees, 505 of
whom were employed in field and plant operations.

Available Information

     Pioneer files annual,  quarterly and current reports,  proxy statements and
other  documents  with the SEC under the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934.  The
public may read and copy any  materials  that Pioneer  files with the SEC at the
SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20549. The
public may obtain  information on the operation of the Public  Reference Room by
calling the SEC at  1-800-SEC-0330.  Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website
that contains reports, proxy and information  statements,  and other information
regarding issuers, including Pioneer, that file electronically with the SEC. The
public  can  obtain  any   documents   that  Pioneer   files  with  the  SEC  at
http://www.sec.gov.

     The Company also makes  available free of charge on or through its Internet
website  (http://www.pioneernrc.com)  its Annual Report on Form 10-K,  Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments
to those  reports  filed or furnished  pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange
Act as soon  as  reasonably  practicable  after  it  electronically  files  such
material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

Mission and Strategies

     The Company's mission is to provide  shareholders with superior  investment
returns through strategies that maximize Pioneer's  long-term  profitability and
net asset value. The strategies  employed to achieve this mission are predicated
on  maintaining  financial   flexibility  and  capital  allocation   discipline.
Historically,  these  strategies have been anchored by the Company's  long-lived
Spraberry  oil field and Hugoton and West  Panhandle  gas fields'  reserves  and
production.  Underlying  these  fields  are  approximately  65  percent  of  the
Company's proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2003. These fields have
a remaining  productive  life in excess of 40 years.  The stable base of oil and
gas  production  from these fields,  combined with the deepwater  Gulf of Mexico
Canyon  Express,  Falcon and Harrier gas  projects  which  began  production  in
September  2002,  March 2003 and January 2004,  respectively,  and the Sable oil
discovery in South Africa which began  production  in August 2003 will  generate
the  operating  cash flows that will allow the Company to improve its  financial
flexibility  in 2004.  These  activities  will be  further  enhanced  by initial
production  in mid-2004  from the  Company's  Devils Tower oil discovery and the
Raptor and  Tomahawk  gas  discoveries,  all  located in the  deepwater  Gulf of
Mexico.

     The  above  exploration  successes  represent  some of the  results  of the
Company's   decision  to  selectively   reinvest  capital  from  the  long-lived
Spraberry,  Hugoton  and  West  Panhandle  fields  to  areas  offering  superior
investment  returns.  Similarly,  the Company will continue to: (a)  selectively
explore for and develop proved reserve  discoveries in areas that offer superior
reserve  growth and  profitability  potential;  (b)  evaluate  opportunities  to
acquire oil and gas  properties  under terms that will  complement the Company's
exploration and development drilling activities; (c) invest in the personnel and
technology  necessary  to maximize the  Company's  exploration  and  development
successes; and (d) enhance liquidity,  allowing the Company to take advantage of
future exploration,  development and acquisition  opportunities.  The Company is
committed  to  continuing  to enhance  shareholder  investment  returns  through
adherence to these strategies.







Business Activities

     The  Company  is an  independent  oil and gas  exploration  and  production
company.  Pioneer's  purpose is to  competitively  and  profitably  explore for,
develop and produce oil, NGL and gas  reserves.  In so doing,  the Company sells
homogenous  oil, NGL and gas units which,  except for  geographic and relatively
minor qualitative  differentials,  cannot be significantly  differentiated  from
units offered for sale by the Company's  competitors.  Competitive  advantage is
gained in the oil and gas exploration and development  industry through superior
capital  investment  decisions,  technological  innovation  and  price  and cost
management.

     Petroleum  industry.  The  petroleum  industry  has been  characterized  by
fluctuating  oil, NGL and gas commodity  prices and relatively  stable  supplier
costs during the three years ended  December 31, 2003.  During and just prior to
2000, the  Organization of Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  ("OPEC") and certain
other oil exporting  nations reduced their oil export volumes.  Those reductions
in oil export volumes had a positive impact on world oil prices,  as did overall
gas supply and demand  fundamentals  on North American gas prices.  During 2002,
world  oil  prices   increased  in  response  to  political  unrest  and  supply
disruptions  in the Middle East and  Venezuela  while North  American gas prices
improved as market fundamentals  strengthened.  During 2003, world oil and North
American gas supply and demand fundamentals continued to strengthen. Significant
factors that will impact 2004 commodity  prices include the final  resolution of
issues  currently  impacting Iraq and the Middle East in general,  the extent to
which  members of OPEC and other oil  exporting  nations are able to continue to
manage oil supply  through  export quotas and overall North  American gas supply
and demand fundamentals. To mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on
the Company's net asset value,  Pioneer utilizes commodity hedge contracts.  See
Note J of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in "Item 8.
Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for  information  regarding the
impact to oil and gas revenues  during the years ended  December 31, 2003,  2002
and 2001 from the Company's  hedging  activities  and the  Company's  open hedge
positions at December 31, 2003.

     The Company.  The  Company's  asset base is anchored by the  Spraberry  oil
field located in West Texas,  the Hugoton gas field located in Southwest  Kansas
and the West Panhandle gas field located in the Texas  Panhandle.  Complementing
these areas,  the Company has exploration and development  opportunities  and/or
oil and gas production  activities in the Gulf of Mexico, the onshore Gulf Coast
area and in Alaska,  and  internationally  in Argentina,  Canada,  Gabon,  South
Africa and Tunisia.  Combined,  these assets create a portfolio of resources and
opportunities  that are well balanced among oil, NGLs and gas, and that are also
well balanced  between  long-lived,  dependable  production and  exploration and
development  opportunities.  Additionally,  the Company has a team of  dedicated
employees that  represent the  professional  disciplines  and sciences that will
allow  Pioneer to  maximize  the  long-term  profitability  and net asset  value
inherent in its physical assets.

     The Company provides  administrative,  financial and management  support to
United  States and foreign  subsidiaries  that explore for,  develop and produce
oil,  NGL  and gas  reserves.  Production  operations  are  principally  located
domestically  in  Texas,   Kansas,   Louisiana  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and
internationally in Argentina, Canada, South Africa and Tunisia.

     Production.  The Company focuses its efforts towards maximizing its average
daily production of oil, NGLs and gas through development  drilling,  production
enhancement activities and acquisitions of producing properties while minimizing
the  controllable  costs associated with the production  activities.  During the
year ended  December  31, 2003,  the  Company's  average  daily oil, NGL and gas
production  increased as a result of (i) a full year of gas production  from the
Company's  Canyon Express gas project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,  (ii) gas
production since March 2003 from the Company's Falcon gas field in the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico,  (iii) increased  production from Argentina  primarily resulting
from the resumption of oil drilling  activities since the third quarter of 2002,
(iv) oil production  since May 2003 from the Company's Adam field in Tunisia and
(v) oil  production  since August 2003 from the Company's  Sable field  offshore
South  Africa.  These  increases  more than offset normal  production  declines.
During 2002, the Company's  average daily oil, NGL and gas production  decreased
primarily due to normal production  declines,  reduced Argentine demand for gas,
the Company's curtailment of Argentine drilling activities during the first half
of 2002 and the December 2001 sale of the Company's  Rycroft/Spirit  River field
in Canada.  During 2001, the Company's average daily oil, NGL and gas production
decreased  primarily as a result of oil and gas property  divestitures that were
supportive of the Company's  debt  reduction  goal.  Production,  price and cost
information with respect to the Company's properties for each of the years ended







December  31,  2003,  2002 and 2001 is set forth  under  "Item 2.  Properties  -
Selected Oil and Gas Information - Production, Price and Cost Data".

     Drilling  activities.  The  Company  seeks  to  increase  its  oil  and gas
reserves,  production and cash flow through exploratory and development drilling
and  by  conducting  other  production  enhancement  activities,  such  as  well
recompletions.  During the three  years ended  December  31,  2003,  the Company
drilled  1,002 gross  (744.1 net) wells,  86 percent of which were  successfully
completed as productive  wells,  at a total  drilling cost (net to the Company's
interest) of $1.5  billion.  During 2003,  the Company  drilled 383 gross (338.8
net) wells. The Company's current 2004 capital expenditure budget is expected to
range from $550 million to $600 million.  Excluding the 2003  acquisitions,  the
Company's 2004 capital  expenditure  budget is comparable to 2003 costs incurred
for oil and gas  producing  activities.  The Company has  allocated the budgeted
2004 capital  expenditures  as follows:  65 percent to development  drilling and
facility activities and 35 percent to exploration activities.

     The Company  believes that its current property base provides a substantial
inventory of prospects for future reserve,  production and cash flow growth. The
Company's  proved  reserves as of December 31, 2003 include  proved  undeveloped
reserves and proved  developed  reserves  that are behind pipe of 188.9  million
Bbls of oil and NGLs and 670.8 Bcf of gas.  Development  of these  reserves will
require  future  capital  expenditures.  The timing of the  development of these
reserves will be dependent upon the commodity price  environment,  the Company's
expected operating cash flows and the Company's financial condition. The Company
believes  that its current  portfolio  of  undeveloped  prospects  and  reserves
provides attractive  development and exploration  opportunities for at least the
next three to five years.

     Exploratory  activities.  Since 1998,  the Company has devoted  significant
efforts and  resources  to hiring and  developing a highly  skilled  exploration
staff  as  well  as  acquiring   and   drilling  a  portfolio   of   exploration
opportunities.   The  Company's   commitment  to  exploration  has  resulted  in
significant  discoveries  during  this time  period,  such as the 1998 Sable oil
field  discovery in South Africa;  the 1999 Aconcagua,  2000 Devils Tower,  2001
Falcon and 2003 Harrier,  Tomahawk and Raptor  discoveries in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico;  the 2001 Olowi permit discovery located in the Southern Gabon basin;
and the 2002 Borj El Khadra  permit  discovery  in the  Ghadames  basin  onshore
Southern Tunisia.  The Company  currently  anticipates that its 2004 exploration
efforts will be approximately 35 percent of total 2004 capital  expenditures and
will be concentrated  domestically in the Gulf of Mexico, and internationally in
Argentina,  Canada,  Gabon and Tunisia.  Exploratory  drilling  involves greater
risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons than
development  drilling or enhanced recovery  activities.  See "Item 1. Business -
Risks Associated with Business Activities - Drilling activities" below.

     Acquisition  activities.  The Company regularly seeks to acquire properties
that   complement  its   operations,   provide   exploration   and   development
opportunities  and  potentially  provide  superior  returns  on  investment.  In
addition, the Company pursues strategic acquisitions that will allow the Company
to expand into new  geographical  areas that feature  producing  properties  and
provide exploration/exploitation  opportunities. During the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company expended $151.0 million, $195.5 million and
$170.8  million,  respectively,  of acquisition  capital to purchase  additional
interests  in, and other assets  associated  with,  its  existing  assets and to
acquire new prospects for future exploration activities.  See Note D of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" for a description of the Company's acquisitions during 2003,
2002 and 2001.

     The Company  periodically  evaluates and pursues acquisition  opportunities
(including opportunities to acquire particular oil and gas properties or related
assets;   entities  owning  oil  and  gas  properties  or  related  assets;  and
opportunities   to  engage  in  mergers,   consolidations   or  other   business
combinations  with such entities) and at any given time may be in various stages
of  evaluating  such  opportunities.  Such  stages may take the form of internal
financial analysis, oil and gas reserve analysis, due diligence,  the submission
of an indication of interest, preliminary negotiations,  negotiation of a letter
of intent or negotiation of a definitive agreement.

     Asset  divestitures.  The Company  regularly reviews its asset base for the
purpose of  identifying  non-strategic  assets,  the  disposition of which would
increase   capital   resources   available  for  other   activities  and  create
organizational  and operational  efficiencies.  While the Company generally does
not dispose of assets solely for the purpose of reducing debt, such dispositions
can  have  the  result  of  furthering  the  Company's  objective  of  financial
flexibility through reduced debt levels.







     During the years ended  December 31,  2003,  2002 and 2001,  the  Company's
divestitures  consisted of the early  termination of derivative  hedge contracts
and the sales of oil and gas  properties  and other  assets for net  proceeds of
$35.7 million, $118.9 million and $113.5 million,  respectively,  which resulted
in 2003, 2002 and 2001 net divestiture  gains of $1.3 million,  $4.4 million and
$7.7 million,  respectively.  The net cash proceeds from the 2003, 2002 and 2001
asset  dispositions  were  primarily  used  to  fund  additions  to oil  and gas
properties or to reduce the Company's  outstanding  indebtedness.  See Note N of
Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  "Item 8.  Financial
Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for  specific  information  regarding  the
Company's asset divestitures.

     The  Company  anticipates  that it  will  continue  to  sell  non-strategic
properties  or other  assets  from time to time to  increase  capital  resources
available  for  other  activities,   to  achieve  operating  and  administrative
efficiencies and to improve profitability.

Operations by Geographic Area

     The Company operates in one industry segment.  During the three years ended
December  31,  2003,  the  Company  had oil and gas  producing  and  development
activities in the United  States,  Argentina,  Canada,  Gabon,  South Africa and
Tunisia, and had exploration activities in the United States, Argentina, Canada,
Gabon, South Africa and Tunisia.  See Note R of Notes to Consolidated  Financial
Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for
geographic  operating segment  information,  including results of operations and
segment assets.

Marketing of Production

     General. Production from the Company's properties is marketed using methods
that are consistent with industry  practices.  Sales prices for oil, NGL and gas
production are negotiated based on factors normally  considered in the industry,
such as the index or spot  price  for gas or the  posted  price  for oil,  price
regulations,  distance from the well to the pipeline,  well pressure,  estimated
reserves, commodity quality and prevailing supply conditions.

     Significant  purchasers.  During  the year ended  December  31,  2003,  the
Company's primary purchasers of oil were ExxonMobil  Corporation  ("ExxonMobil")
and Plains Marketing LP ("Plains"),  the Company's primary purchaser of NGLs was
Enterprise  Products  Operating L.P.  ("Enterprise")  and the Company's  primary
purchasers  of  gas  were  Williams  Energy  Services  ("Williams")  and  Conoco
Phillips.  Approximately  16 percent,  eight  percent  and seven  percent of the
Company's 2003 combined oil, NGL and gas revenues were  attributable to sales to
Williams, Conoco Phillips and Enterprise,  respectively,  and approximately five
percent of combined oil, NGL and gas revenues of 2003 were attributable to sales
to ExxonMobil and Plains. The Company is of the opinion that the loss of any one
purchaser  would not have an adverse  effect on its ability to sell its oil, NGL
and gas production.

     Hedging  activities.   The  Company  utilizes  commodity  swap  and  collar
contracts  in  order  to (i)  reduce  the  effect  of  price  volatility  on the
commodities the Company  produces and sells,  (ii) support the Company's  annual
capital  budgeting and expenditure  plans and (iii) reduce  commodity price risk
associated with certain capital projects.  See "Item 7. Management's  Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a description
of the Company's  hedging  activities,  "Item 7A.  Quantitative  and Qualitative
Disclosures  About  Market Risk" and Note J of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for
information concerning the impact on oil and gas revenues during the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 from the Company's commodity hedging activities
and the Company's open commodity hedge positions at December 31, 2003.

Competition, Markets and Regulations

     Competition. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. A large number
of companies and  individuals  engage in the  exploration for and development of
oil and gas  properties,  and there is a high degree of competition  for oil and
gas properties suitable for development or exploration.  Acquisitions of oil and
gas  properties  have been an important  element of the  Company's  growth.  The
Company  intends to continue to acquire oil and gas properties  that  complement
its  operations,   provide   exploration  and  development   opportunities   and
potentially  provide  superior return on investment.  The principal  competitive
factors in the acquisition of oil and gas properties  include the staff and data
necessary  to  identify,  investigate  and  purchase  such  properties  and  the








financial resources necessary to acquire and develop the properties. Many of the
Company's  competitors  are  substantially  larger and have  financial and other
resources greater than those of the Company.

     Markets.  The  Company's  ability to produce and market  oil,  NGLs and gas
profitably depends on numerous factors beyond the Company's control.  The effect
of these factors  cannot be accurately  predicted or  anticipated.  Although the
Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect these  commodity
prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected,  the prices for any
commodity that the Company  produces will generally  approximate  current market
prices in the geographic region of the production.

     Governmental  regulations.  Enterprises  that  sell  securities  in  public
markets are subject to  regulatory  oversight by agencies  such as the SEC. This
regulatory  oversight imposes on the Company the responsibility for establishing
and  maintaining  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  that will  ensure  that
material information  relating to the Company and its consolidated  subsidiaries
is made known to the Company's  management and that the financial statements and
other  financial  information  included in this Report do not contain any untrue
statement of a material  fact,  or omit to state a material  fact,  necessary to
make the statements made in this Report not misleading.

     Oil and gas  exploration  and  production  operations  are also  subject to
various  types of  regulation  by local,  state,  federal and foreign  agencies.
Additionally,  the Company's  operations are subject to state  conservation laws
and regulations,  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and
gas properties,  the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells and
the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of wells. States and foreign
governments  generally  impose a  production  or  severance  tax with respect to
production and sale of oil and gas within their  respective  jurisdictions.  The
regulatory  burden on the oil and gas industry  increases the Company's  cost of
doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability.

     Additional  proposals  and  proceedings  that might  affect the oil and gas
industry  are  considered  from time to time by  Congress,  the  Federal  Energy
Regulatory   Commission,   state  regulatory  bodies,  the  courts  and  foreign
governments.  The Company  cannot  predict when or if any such  proposals  might
become effective or their effect, if any, on the Company's operations.

     Environmental and health controls.  The Company's operations are subject to
numerous  federal,  state,  local and foreign laws and  regulations  relating to
environmental and health protection.  These laws and regulations may require the
acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the type, quantities
and  concentration  of  various   substances  that  can  be  released  into  the
environment  in connection  with drilling and  production  activities,  limit or
prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness,  wetlands
and other  protected  areas and impose  substantial  liabilities  for  pollution
resulting  from oil and gas  operations.  These  laws and  regulations  may also
restrict air emissions or other  discharges  resulting from the operation of gas
processing plants,  pipeline systems and other facilities that the Company owns.
Although  the Company  believes  that  compliance  with  environmental  laws and
regulations  will not have a material  adverse  effect on its future  results of
operations or financial  condition,  risks of substantial  costs and liabilities
are  inherent  in oil and gas  operations,  and there can be no  assurance  that
significant costs and liabilities,  including potential criminal penalties, will
not be  incurred.  Moreover,  it is possible  that other  developments,  such as
stricter environmental laws and regulations or claims for damages to property or
persons  resulting  from the Company's  operations,  could result in substantial
costs and liabilities.

     The Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation,  and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability, without regard
to fault or the legality of the original conduct,  on certain classes of persons
with respect to the release of a  "hazardous  substance"  into the  environment.
These persons  include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where
the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of
hazardous  substances  released at the site. Persons who are or were responsible
for  releases of hazardous  substances  under CERCLA may be subject to joint and
several  liability  for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous  substances  that
have been released into the  environment  and for damages to natural  resources,
and it is not uncommon for  neighboring  landowners  and other third  parties to
file claims for personal  injury and  property  damage  allegedly  caused by the
hazardous substances released into the environment.

     The Company generates wastes,  including hazardous wastes, that are subject
to the federal  Resource  Conservation  and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable
state statutes.  The United States  Environmental Protection  Agency and various







state  agencies  have  limited  the  approved  methods of  disposal  for certain
hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the
Company's oil and gas  operations  that are currently  exempt from  treatment as
hazardous  wastes may in the  future be  designated  as  hazardous  wastes,  and
therefore  be  subject  to more  rigorous  and  costly  operating  and  disposal
requirements.

     The Company currently owns or leases,  and has in the past owned or leased,
properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production
of oil and gas  reserves.  Although the Company has used  operating and disposal
practices that were standard in the industry at the time,  hydrocarbons or other
wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or
leased by the Company or on or under other locations where such wastes have been
taken for disposal. In addition,  some of these properties have been operated by
third parties whose  treatment and disposal or release of  hydrocarbons or other
wastes was not under the  Company's  control.  These  properties  and the wastes
disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA,  RCRA and analogous state laws. Under
such laws,  the  Company  could be required  to remove or  remediate  previously
disposed  wastes or  property  contamination  or to  perform  remedial  plugging
operations to prevent future contamination.

     Federal  regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that
store or otherwise  handle oil,  such as the Company,  to prepare and  implement
spill prevention control plans, countermeasure plans and facility response plans
relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution
Prevention Act of 1990 ("OPA")  amends  certain  provisions of the federal Water
Pollution  Control  Act of 1972,  commonly  referred  to as the Clean  Water Act
("CWA"), and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to
oil spills into  navigable  waters.  The OPA subjects  owners of  facilities  to
strict joint and several  liability  for all  containment  and cleanup costs and
certain other damages arising from a spill,  including,  but not limited to, the
costs of  responding  to a release of oil to surface  waters.  The CWA  provides
penalties for any discharges of petroleum products in reportable  quantities and
imposes  substantial  liability for the costs of removing a spill.  OPA requires
responsible   parties  to   establish   and   maintain   evidence  of  financial
responsibility  to cover removal costs and damages  resulting from an oil spill.
OPA calls for a  financial  responsibility  of $35  million  to cover  pollution
cleanup for offshore  facilities.  State laws for the control of water pollution
also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of
releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground.
The Company  does not believe  that the OPA,  CWA or related  state laws are any
more  burdensome  to it than they are to other  similarly  situated  oil and gas
companies.

     Many  states in which the Company  operates  regulate  naturally  occurring
radioactive  materials ("NORM") and NORM wastes that are generated in connection
with oil and gas exploration and production  activities.  NORM wastes  typically
consist of very low-level  radioactive  substances  that become  concentrated in
pipe scale and in production  equipment.  Certain state regulations  require the
testing  of pipes  and  production  equipment  for the  presence  of  NORM,  the
licensing of NORM-contaminated  facilities and the careful handling and disposal
of NORM  wastes.  The  regulation  of NORM has minimal  effect on the  Company's
operations  because the Company  generates  only small  quantities of NORM on an
annual basis.

     The Company does not believe that its  environmental  risks are  materially
different  from  those  of  comparable  companies  in the oil and gas  industry.
Nevertheless,  no assurance can be given that environmental laws will not result
in a curtailment of production or processing,  a material  increase in the costs
of production,  development,  exploration  or processing or otherwise  adversely
affect the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.

     The Company employs an environmental director and environmental specialists
charged with monitoring  environmental  and regulatory  compliance.  The Company
performs an environmental  review as part of the due diligence work on potential
acquisitions.  The  Company  is not aware of any  material  environmental  legal
proceedings  pending  against it or any material  environmental  liabilities  to
which it may be subject.

Risks Associated with Business Activities

     The nature of the business activities  conducted by the Company subjects it
to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material
risks relating to the Company's business activities.

     Commodity  prices.  The Company's  revenues,  profitability,  cash flow and
future  rate of growth are highly  dependent  on oil and gas  prices,  which are
affected by numerous  factors beyond the  Company's control.  Oil and gas prices







historically have been very volatile.  A significant downward trend in commodity
prices  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  revenues,
profitability and cash flow and could, under certain circumstances,  result in a
reduction in the carrying  value of the Company's oil and gas properties and the
recognition  of a deferred tax asset  valuation  allowance or an increase to the
Company's  deferred tax asset valuation  allowances,  depending on the Company's
tax attributes in each country in which it has activities.

     Drilling activities.  Drilling involves numerous risks,  including the risk
that no commercially  productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.  The
cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and drilling
operations  may be  curtailed,  delayed or  canceled as a result of a variety of
factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in
formations,  equipment  failures or accidents,  adverse  weather  conditions and
shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.  The Company's future drilling
activities may not be successful and, if  unsuccessful,  such failure could have
an adverse  effect on the Company's  future  results of operations and financial
condition.  While all drilling,  whether developmental or exploratory,  involves
these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure
to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.  Because of the percentage of the
Company's  capital budget  devoted to higher risk  exploratory  projects,  it is
likely that the Company will continue to experience  exploration and abandonment
expense.

     Unproved  properties.  At December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the Company  carried
unproved  property  costs of $179.8  million and $219.1  million,  respectively.
Generally accepted  accounting  principles require periodic  evaluation of these
costs on a  project-by-project  basis in  comparison to their  estimated  value.
These  evaluations  will be affected by the results of  exploration  activities,
commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion
of the  leases,  contracts  and permits  appurtenant  to such  projects.  If the
quantity of potential reserves  determined by such evaluations is not sufficient
to fully recover the cost invested in each project,  the Company will  recognize
noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.

     Acquisitions.  Acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have been a
key element of the Company's  growth.  The Company's  growth  following the full
development  of its existing  property  base could be impeded if it is unable to
acquire  additional oil and gas reserves on a profitable  basis.  The success of
any  acquisition  will depend on a number of factors,  including  the ability to
estimate  accurately  the  recoverable  volumes  of  reserves,  rates of  future
production  and future net revenues  attainable  from the reserves and to assess
possible  environmental  liabilities.  All of these  factors  affect  whether an
acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows sufficient to provide a suitable
return  on  investment.  Even  though  the  Company  performs  a  review  of the
properties  it seeks to acquire  that it believes is  consistent  with  industry
practices, such reviews are often limited in scope.

     Divestitures.  The  Company  regularly  reviews its  property  base for the
purpose of  identifying  non-strategic  assets,  the  disposition of which would
increase   capital   resources   available  for  other   activities  and  create
organizational  and operational  efficiencies.  Various factors could materially
affect the ability of the Company to dispose of non-strategic assets,  including
the availability of purchasers  willing to purchase the non-strategic  assets at
prices acceptable to the Company.

     Operation of natural gas  processing  plants.  As of December 31, 2003, the
Company owned  interests in 11 natural gas  processing  plants and five treating
facilities.  The  Company  operates  seven of the plants  and all five  treating
facilities. There are significant risks associated with the operation of natural
gas processing  plants.  Gas and NGLs are volatile and explosive and may include
carcinogens.  Damage to or  misoperation  of a gas processing  plant or facility
could result in an explosion or the discharge of toxic gases, which could result
in significant damage claims in addition to interrupting a revenue source.

     Operating  hazards and  uninsured  losses.  The  Company's  operations  are
subject to all the risks normally  incident to the oil and gas  exploration  and
production business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and
other  environmental  damage, any of which could result in substantial losses to
the Company due to injury or loss of life,  damage to or  destruction  of wells,
production facilities or other property,  clean-up responsibilities,  regulatory
investigations and penalties and suspension of operations.  Although the Company
currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers  reasonable and that is
similar to that maintained by comparable  companies in the oil and gas industry,
it is not fully  insured  against  certain of these risks,  either  because such
insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs  associated with
obtaining such insurance.








     Environmental.  The  oil and  gas  business  is  subject  to  environmental
hazards,  such as oil spills,  produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and
discharges  of toxic  substances  or gases  that  could  expose  the  Company to
substantial liability due to pollution and other environmental damage. A variety
of federal,  state and foreign  laws and  regulations  govern the  environmental
aspects  of the  oil  and  gas  business.  Noncompliance  with  these  laws  and
regulations may subject the Company to penalties,  damages or other liabilities,
and compliance may increase the cost of the Company's operations.  Such laws and
regulations may also affect the costs of  acquisitions.  See "Item 1. Business -
Competition,  Markets and Regulation - Environmental  and health controls" above
for additional discussion related to environmental risks.

     The Company does not believe that its  environmental  risks are  materially
different  from  those  of  comparable  companies  in the oil and gas  industry.
Nevertheless,  no assurance can be given that future environmental laws will not
result in a curtailment of production or processing,  a material increase in the
costs  of  production,  development,  exploration  or  processing  or  otherwise
adversely  affect the  Company's  future  operations  and  financial  condition.
Pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.

     Debt restrictions and  availability.  The Company is a borrower under fixed
term senior notes and a corporate  credit  facility.  The terms of the Company's
borrowings  under the senior notes and the  corporate  credit  facility  specify
scheduled  debt  repayments  and  require  the  Company to comply  with  certain
associated covenants and restrictions.  The Company's ability to comply with the
debt repayment  terms,  associated  covenants and  restrictions is dependent on,
among other  things,  factors  outside the  Company's  direct  control,  such as
commodity  prices,  interest rates and competition for available debt financing.
See Note E of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in "Item 8.
Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for  information  regarding the
Company's  outstanding  debt as of December  31,  2003 and the terms  associated
therewith.

     Competition.  The oil and gas industry is highly  competitive.  The Company
competes with other  companies,  producers and operators for acquisitions and in
the exploration,  development,  production and marketing of oil and gas. Some of
these competitors have substantially  greater financial and other resources than
the Company. See "Item 1. Business - Competition,  Markets and Regulation" above
for additional discussion regarding competition.

     Government regulation.  The Company's business is regulated by a variety of
federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations.  There  can be no
assurance  that  present or future  regulations  will not  adversely  affect the
Company's business and operations. See "Item 1. Business - Competition,  Markets
and Regulation" above for additional discussion regarding government regulation.

     International operations. At December 31, 2003, approximately 21 percent of
the  Company's  proved  reserves of oil,  NGLs and gas were located  outside the
United States (16 percent in Argentina,  three percent in Africa and two percent
in Canada).  The success and  profitability of  international  operations may be
adversely affected by risks associated with international activities,  including
economic  and  labor  conditions,  political  instability,  tax laws  (including
host-country export,  excise and income taxes and United States taxes on foreign
subsidiaries)  and  changes  in the value of the U.S.  dollar  versus  the local
currencies in which oil and gas producing activities may be denominated.  To the
extent  that the Company is involved  in  international  activities,  changes in
exchange rates may adversely  affect the Company's  future results of operations
and financial condition.  See Critical Accounting Estimates included in "Item 7.
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations" and Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
"Item 8. Financial  Statements and Supplementary Data" for information  specific
to Argentina's economic and political situation.

     Estimates of reserves and future net revenues. Numerous uncertainties exist
in estimating  quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues  therefrom.
The  estimates of proved  reserves and related  future net revenues set forth in
this Report are based on various  assumptions,  which may ultimately prove to be
inaccurate.  Therefore,  such  estimates  should not be  construed  as  accurate
estimates of the current market value of the Company's proved reserves.







ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

     The  information  included in this Report about the Company's  oil, NGL and
gas  reserves as of December  31, 2003 was based on reserve  reports  audited by
Netherland,  Sewell & Associates, Inc. for the Company's major properties in the
United States,  Argentina,  Canada and South Africa and reserve reports prepared
by the Company's engineers for all other properties. The reserve audit conducted
by Netherland,  Sewell & Associates, Inc. in aggregate represented 87 percent of
the Company's  estimated proved  quantities of reserves as of December 31, 2003.
The  information  included in this Report about the  Company's  oil, NGL and gas
reserves  as of  December  31,  2002 was based on  reserve  reports  audited  by
Netherland,  Sewell & Associates, Inc. for the Company's major properties in the
United  States,  Canada and South Africa,  reserve  reports  audited by Gaffney,
Cline &  Associates,  Inc. for the Company's  properties  located in the Neuquen
Basin in Argentina and reserve reports  prepared by the Company's  engineers for
all other  properties.  The reserve  audits  conducted by  Netherland,  Sewell &
Associates,   Inc.  and  Gaffney,  Cline  &  Associates,   Inc.,  in  aggregate,
represented 71 percent of the Company's  estimated proved quantities of reserves
as of December 31, 2002. The information in this Report about the Company's oil,
NGL and gas  reserves  as of December  31, 2001 was based on proved  reserves as
determined by the Company's engineers.

     Numerous  uncertainties  exist in estimating  quantities of proved reserves
and  in  projecting  future  rates  of  production  and  timing  of  development
expenditures,  including many factors beyond the Company's control.  This Report
contains  estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves and the related
future net revenues,  which are based on various  assumptions,  including  those
prescribed by the SEC. Actual future production,  oil and gas prices,  revenues,
taxes,  capital  expenditures,  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable
oil and gas reserves may vary  substantially from those assumed in the estimates
and could materially  affect the estimated  quantities and related  Standardized
Measure of proved reserves set forth in this Report. In addition,  the Company's
reserves  may be subject to downward  or upward  revisions  based on  production
performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future exploration and
development  activities,  prevailing  oil  and gas  prices  and  other  factors.
Therefore,  estimates of the Standardized  Measure of proved reserves should not
be construed as accurate  estimates of the current market value of the Company's
assets.

     Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis
for comparing oil and gas companies  subject to the rules and regulations of the
SEC. It requires the use of oil and gas spot prices prevailing as of the date of
computation.  Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or
that will be  received  for oil and gas  production  because of  seasonal  price
fluctuations or other varying market conditions. Standardized Measures as of any
date  are  not   necessarily   indicative  of  future   results  of  operations.
Accordingly,  estimates included herein of future net revenues may be materially
different from the net revenues that are ultimately received.

     The Company did not provide  estimates of total proved oil and gas reserves
during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 or 2001 to any federal  authority
or agency, other than the SEC.

Proved Reserves

     The  Company's  proved  reserves  totaled 789.1 million BOE at December 31,
2003,  736.7  million BOE at December 31, 2002 and 671.4 million BOE at December
31,  2001,   representing   $4.6   billion,   $4.1  billion  and  $2.5  billion,
respectively,  of  Standardized  Measure or $6.0 billion,  $5.1 billion and $2.5
billion, respectively, on a pre-tax basis. The seven and 11 percent increases in
proved reserve volumes and Standardized Measure, respectively,  during 2003 were
primarily due to two core area acquisitions, discoveries in Gabon, the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico and Tunisia  and  positive  reserve  revisions  due to  increased
commodity  prices extending the estimated  economic life of various  properties,
increased  recoverable  reserve  estimates  based  on well  performance  and the
addition of reserves resulting from the Company' expanded  development  drilling
program.  The ten  and 65  percent  increases  in  proved  reserve  volumes  and
Standardized Measure, respectively, during 2002 were attributable to an increase
in commodity  prices,  the purchase of incremental  interests in two core assets
and the Company's successful capital investments.

     On a BOE basis,  65 percent  of the  Company's  total  proved  reserves  at
December 31, 2003 were proved developed  reserves.  Based on reserve information
as of December 31, 2003, and using the Company's production  information for the
year then ended, the  reserve-to-production  ratio associated with the Company's
proved  reserves was 14.0 years on a BOE basis.  The  following  table  provides
information regarding the Company's proved reserves and average daily production
by geographic area as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003:








Finding Cost and Reserve Replacement

     The  Company's  acquisition  and finding  costs per BOE for the years ended
December  31,  2003,  2002  and  2001  were  $6.64,  $6.30  and  $7.49  per BOE,
respectively. The average acquisition and finding cost for the three-year period
ended  December  31,  2003 was  $6.76  per BOE,  representing  an eight  percent
increase over the 2002 three-year average rate of $6.24 per BOE.

     During the year ended December 31, 2003,  the Company  replaced 193 percent
of its annual  production  on a BOE basis (299  percent for oil and NGLs and 129
percent for gas).  During 2002,  the Company  replaced 258 percent of its annual
production  on a BOE basis (384  percent  for oil and NGLs and 144  percent  for
gas).  During 2001, the Company replaced 208 percent of its annual production on
a BOE  basis  (169  percent  for oil and  NGLs and 245  percent  for  gas).  The
Company's  2003 and 2002  reserve  replacement  percentages  were the  result of
revisions  of  previous  estimates  including  revisions  related  to changes in
commodity prices, asset purchases and new discoveries and field extensions.  The
Company's 2001 reserve  replacement  percentage was primarily  impacted by asset
purchases and new discoveries and field extensions.

Description of Properties

     As of December 31, 2003,  the Company has  production,  development  and/or
exploration  operations in the United States,  Argentina,  Canada,  Gabon, South
Africa and Tunisia.

     Domestic.  The  Company's  domestic  operations  are located in the Permian
Basin, Mid-Continent,  Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast areas of the United
States.  The Company also has unproved  properties in Alaska.  Approximately  83
percent of the  Company's  domestic  proved  reserves at  December  31, 2003 are
located in the Spraberry, Hugoton and West Panhandle fields. These mature fields
generate substantial  operating cash flow and have a large portfolio of low risk
infill  drilling  opportunities.  The cash flows  generated  from  these  fields
provide funding for the Company's other  development and exploration  activities
both domestically and internationally.  During the year ended December 31, 2003,
the Company  expended  $563.0 million in domestic  acquisition,  exploration and
development  drilling  activities.  The Company has budgeted  approximately $427
million for domestic exploration and development drilling expenditures for 2004.

     Spraberry field. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and encompasses
eight counties in West Texas. The field is  approximately  150 miles long and 75
miles wide at its widest  point.  The oil  produced  is West Texas  Intermediate
Sweet,  and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average energy content of
1,400 Btu per Mcf. The oil and gas are produced primarily from three formations,
the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from 6,700 feet to
9,200 feet.  Recently,  the Company has been adding the  Wolfcamp  formation  at
depths  ranging  from 9,300 feet to 10,300  feet to  selected  completions  with
successful  results.  The center of the Spraberry field was unitized in the late
1950s and early 1960s by the major oil companies;  however, until the late 1980s
there was very limited development activity in the field.   The Company believes







the area offers excellent  opportunities to enhance oil and gas reserves because
of the  numerous  undeveloped  infill  drilling  locations,  many of  which  are
reflected  in the  Company's  proved  undeveloped  reserves,  and the ability to
reduce operating expenses through economies of scale.

     During the year ended  December 31, 2003,  the Company placed 123 Spraberry
wells on production and drilled one developmental dry hole. The Company plans to
drill approximately 114 development wells in the Spraberry field during 2004.

     Hugoton field.  The Hugoton field in southwest Kansas is one of the largest
producing gas fields in the continental  United States. The gas is produced from
the Chase and Council  Grove  formations  at depths  ranging  from 2,700 feet to
3,000 feet.  The  Company's  Hugoton  properties  are  located on  approximately
257,000  gross acres  (237,000  net acres),  covering  approximately  400 square
miles.  The Company has working  interests in  approximately  1,200 wells in the
Hugoton field,  about 1,000 of which it operates,  and partial royalty interests
in approximately 500 wells. The Company owns  substantially all of the gathering
and  processing  facilities,  primarily  the  Satanta  plant,  that  service its
production from the Hugoton field.  Such ownership allows the Company to control
the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and NGL production.

     The Company's Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing approximately
90 MMcf  of wet  gas  per day  (i.e.,  gas  production  at the  wellhead  before
processing and before  reduction for royalties),  although actual  production in
the Hugoton field is limited by allowables set by state regulators.  The Company
estimates that it and other major  producers in the Hugoton field produced at or
near capacity during the year ended December 31, 2003.  During 2003, the Company
placed 18 development  wells on production,  drilled one  developmental dry hole
and had one well in progress as of December 31, 2003 in the Hugoton  field.  The
plans for 2004 include drilling approximately 20 development wells.

     The Company is continuing to evaluate the  feasibility  of infill  drilling
into the Council  Grove  Formation and may submit an  application  to the Kansas
Corporation  Commission  to allow  infill  drilling.  Such infill  drilling  may
increase  production from the Company's Hugoton  properties.  However,  until an
application has been submitted and approved, the Company will not reflect any of
the infill drilling  locations as proved undeveloped  reserves.  There can be no
assurance that the application will be filed or approved, or as to the timing of
such approval if granted.

     West  Panhandle  field.  The West  Panhandle  properties are located in the
panhandle  region of Texas where  initial  production  commenced in 1918.  These
stable,  long-lived  reserves are  attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite,
Granite Wash and  fractured  Granite  formations at depths no greater than 3,500
feet.  The  Company's  gas in the West  Panhandle  field has an  average  energy
content of 1,300 Btu per Mcf and is  produced  from  approximately  600 wells on
more than 241,000 acres covering over 375 square miles.  The Company's  wellhead
gas produced  from the West  Panhandle  field  contains a high quantity of NGLs,
yielding  relatively  greater NGL volumes than realized from the Company's 1,025
Btu per Mcf content  wellhead gas in its Hugoton field. The Company controls the
wells,  production equipment,  gathering system and gas processing plant for the
field.

     During  the year  ended  December  31,  2003,  the  Company  placed  71 new
development  wells on  production,  drilled  four  development  wells  that were
plugged and abandoned due to  noncommerciality  and had 24 development wells and
two extension wells in progress at December 31, 2003. The Company plans to drill
approximately 111 wells in the West Panhandle field during 2004.

     Gulf of Mexico  area.  In the Gulf of  Mexico,  the  Company  is focused on
reserve  and  production  growth  through a  portfolio  of shelf  and  deepwater
development projects,  high-impact,  higher-risk deepwater exploration drilling,
shelf  exploration  drilling  and  exploitation  opportunities  inherent  in the
properties the Company currently has producing on the shelf. To accomplish this,
the Company has devoted most of its domestic  exploration efforts to the Gulf of
Mexico shelf and  deepwater as well as  investments  in and  utilization  of 3-D
seismic  technology.  During the year  ended  December  31,  2003,  the  Company
successfully drilled three exploratory wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and
one  successful  development  well on the shelf.  The Company  also drilled four
exploratory  dry  holes  on the  shelf  and two  exploratory  dry  holes  in the
deepwater  Gulf of  Mexico  during  2003 and had four  exploratory  wells in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and one exploratory well on the shelf in progress as of
December 31, 2003.







     In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Company has three major projects,  two
of which are now on  production  and one that was in progress  at  December  31,
2003:

o    Canyon  Express  -  The  Canyon  Express  development  project  is a  joint
     development of three  deepwater Gulf of Mexico gas  discoveries,  including
     the Company's  TotalFinaElf-operated Aconcagua and Marathon-operated Camden
     Hills fields, where the Company holds 37.5 percent and 33.3 percent working
     interests,  respectively.  The Company participated in the discovery of the
     Aconcagua  gas field in 1999  during  the  early  stages  of  building  its
     exploration  program,  and later added  Camden  Hills to its  portfolio  to
     enhance  its  ownership  in the  project.  The Canyon  Express  project was
     approved  for  development  in June 2000 and reached  first  production  in
     September  2002.  The Canyon Express  gathering  system is the first in the
     area and  provides  the Company and its partners  with the  opportunity  to
     collect  gathering and handling  revenues from the use of the system by any
     future discoveries in the area. The Company has plans to drill and complete
     an additional development well at Aconcagua during 2004.

o    Falcon Area - The  Company-operated  Falcon  two-well  field was  completed
     ahead of schedule and placed on production in March 2003.  During the first
     quarter of 2003, the Company drilled its Harrier discovery,  along with two
     exploratory  dry holes.  The Company also acquired the remaining 25 percent
     working  interest in the Falcon field,  Harrier  discovery and  surrounding
     prospects  that it did not already own in March 2003.  In addition,  during
     the third quarter of 2003,  the Company  successfully  drilled the Tomahawk
     and Raptor prospects. All three discoveries,  Harrier, Tomahawk and Raptor,
     will be  developed  as  single-well  subsea  tie-backs  to the Falcon field
     facilities  which were  designed  to be  expandable.  To  accommodate  this
     incremental  production and potential throughput associated with additional
     planned exploration,  an additional parallel pipeline connecting the Falcon
     field to the Falcon  platform  on the Gulf of Mexico  shelf has been added,
     doubling its  capacity to 400 MMcf of gas per day.  The Company  placed the
     Harrier  field on  production  in  early  January  2004 and  plans to place
     Tomahawk  and  Raptor  on  production  in  mid-2004.  In  addition  to  the
     development  operations  discussed above, the Company has budgeted to drill
     up to three additional Falcon area prospects in 2004.

o    Devils Tower - The  Dominion-operated  Devils Tower development project was
     sanctioned in 2001 as a spar development  project with the owners leasing a
     spar from a third party for the life of the field. The hull of the spar was
     constructed  in Indonesia and was  successfully  transported  to the United
     States  during the first  quarter of 2003 where the topsides  were added in
     the fourth quarter of 2003. The spar has slots for eight dry tree wells and
     up to two subsea tie-back risers and is capable of handling 60 MBbls of oil
     per day and 60 MMcf of gas per day. Eight Devils Tower wells and one subsea
     tie-back  well,  the  Triton  field,  have been  drilled  and are  awaiting
     completion.  In  addition,  the Company has  drilled an  appraisal  well at
     Triton that was successful  subsequent to year end and an exploration  well
     is in progress on its  Goldfinger  prospect.  Devils  Tower  production  is
     expected  to begin in  mid-2004  and will be  phased  in as the  wells  are
     individually  completed  from the  spar.  The  Company  holds a 25  percent
     working interest in each of the above projects.

     During  2002,  the  Company  also  participated  in  the  Marathon-operated
deepwater  Gulf of  Mexico  Ozona  Deep  discovery.  The  Company  is  currently
negotiating  a tie-back  agreement  to an  existing  facility  in the area,  the
economics of which will determine future  activities.  In late 2003, the Company
spudded an exploratory  well on the BP-operated  Juno prospect with a 25 percent
working  interest and an exploratory  well on the  Unocal-operated  Myrtle Beach
prospect with a 10 percent working  interest,  each of which remains in progress
with results  expected to be known in February  2004.  The Company also plans to
spud an exploratory well on the  Dominion-operated  Thunder Hawk prospect during
2004. The Company has a 12.5 percent working interest in Thunder Hawk.

     During January 2003, the Company  announced a joint  exploration  agreement
with Woodside Energy (USA), Inc.  ("Woodside"),  a subsidiary of Woodside Energy
Ltd. of Australia,  for a two-year drilling program over the shallow-water Texas
shelf region of the Gulf of Mexico. Under the agreement,  Woodside acquired a 50
percent  working  interest in 47  offshore  exploration  blocks  operated by the
Company.  The  agreement  covers eight  prospects and 19 leads and included five
exploratory  wells to be drilled in 2003 and three in 2004. Most of the wells to
be drilled  under the  agreement  will target gas plays below 15,000  feet.  The
first three wells under this joint agreement were unsuccessful. The fourth well,
Midway,  subsequent to December 31, 2003  encountered 30 feet of net gas pay and
is  expected  to be tied back to an  existing  production  platform  with  first
production  anticipated  during the second half of 2004.  Three other  intervals
with an additional 60 feet of gas bearing sands were also  encountered  and will
require  additional  analysis  to determine  future  commercial  potential.  The







Company has a 37.5 percent  working  interest in this well. The fifth well to be
drilled in 2003 and the three  wells  scheduled  for 2004  under the  agreement,
which has been extended for one  additional  year,  were  mutually  agreed to be
deferred  until more  technical  work can be performed on the  prospects by both
companies.  Additionally,  the Company and Woodside are evaluating shallower gas
prospects  on the  Gulf of  Mexico  shelf  for  possible  inclusion  in the 2004
drilling program.

     Onshore Gulf Coast area.  The Company has focused its  drilling  efforts in
this area on the Pawnee  field in the  Edwards  Reef trend in South  Texas.  The
Company  placed five  development  wells and one extension well on production at
Pawnee  during  2003,  had two wells in  progress at year end and plans to drill
approximately ten wells in 2004.

     Alaska area.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company  acquired a 70
percent working  interest and operatorship in ten state leases on Alaska's North
Slope. Associated therewith,  the Company drilled three exploratory wells during
the first quarter of 2003 to test a possible  extension of the productive  sands
in the Kuparuk River field into the shallow waters offshore.  Although all three
of the  wells  found  the  sands  filled  with  oil,  they  were  too thin to be
considered   commercial  on  a  stand-alone  basis.   However,  the  wells  also
encountered  thick sections of oil-bearing  Jurassic-aged  sands,  and the first
well flowed at a sustained rate of approximately 1,300 barrels per day. The test
results are continuing to be evaluated to determine the commercial  viability of
the Jurassic reservoir.  Subsequent to year end, the Company farmed-into a large
acreage  block to the  southwest of the Company's  discovery.  During 2004,  the
Company  plans to evaluate  seismic  data over the area to the  southwest of its
discovery,  analyze  results from other wells  drilled in the area and determine
the location of future exploration wells to further test the discovery.

     In  addition,  the  Company  was the high  bidder on 53 tracts  covering an
additional 159,000 acres on the North Slope in the most recent state lease sale,
establishing a leasehold over a variety of prospects.  The Company has opened an
office in Anchorage and is putting  together a team of employees that will focus
their efforts on enhancing the Company's position in Alaska.

     International.  The Company's  international  operations are located in the
Neuquen and Austral Basins areas of Argentina,  the Chinchaga,  Martin Creek and
Lookout Butte areas of Canada,  the Sable oil field offshore South Africa and in
southern   Tunisia.   Additionally,   the  Company  has  other  significant  oil
development and exploration activities in the shallow waters offshore Gabon, gas
exploration  activities  in the shallow  waters  offshore  South  Africa and oil
development  and  exploration  activities  in Tunisia.  As of December 31, 2003,
approximately 16 percent,  two percent and three percent of the Company's proved
reserves are located in Argentina, Canada and Africa, respectively.

     Argentina.  The  Company's  share of Argentine  production  during the year
ended December 31, 2003 averaged 25.7 MBOE per day, or  approximately 17 percent
of the Company's  equivalent  production.  The Company's operated  production in
Argentina is  concentrated in the Neuquen Basin which is located about 925 miles
southwest  of Buenos Aires and to the east of the Andes  Mountains.  Oil and gas
are produced  primarily from the Al Norte de la Dorsal, the Al Sur de la Dorsal,
the Dadin, the Loma Negra, the Dos Hermanas,  the Anticlinal  Campamento and the
Estacion  Fernandez  Oro blocks,  in each of which the Company has a 100 percent
working interest. Most of the gas produced from these blocks is processed in the
Company's Loma Negra gas processing  plant.  The Company also operates and has a
50 percent  working  interest in the Lago Fuego field which is located in Tierra
del Fuego, an island in the extreme southern portion of Argentina, approximately
1,500 miles south of Buenos Aires.

     Most of the  Company's  non-operated  production in Argentina is located in
Tierra del Fuego where oil, gas and NGLs are produced  from six separate  fields
in which the Company has a 35 percent working  interest.  The Company also has a
14.4 percent working  interest in the Confluencia  field which is located in the
Neuquen Basin.

     During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company expended $52.1 million
on Argentine development,  exploration and acquisition  activities.  The Company
drilled 31 development  wells and 30  extension/exploratory  wells,  of which 29
development  wells and 21  extension/exploratory  wells  were  successful.  Also
during 2003,  the Company  acquired an  additional  150,000  acres in the Ojo de
Agua, Cutral Co Sur and Collun Cura blocks in the Neuquen Basin and shot seismic
covering  approximately  258,000  acres.  The Company plans to be more active in
Argentina  in 2004 with  approximately  $113  million  budgeted  for oil and gas
development and exploration opportunities.







     Canada. The Company's  Canadian producing  properties are located primarily
in  Alberta  and  British  Columbia,  Canada.  Production  during the year ended
December 31, 2003  averaged 8.0 MBOE per day, or  approximately  five percent of
the  Company's  equivalent  production.  The  Company  continues  to  focus  its
development,  exploration  and  acquisition  activities  in the  core  areas  of
northeast  British  Columbia and  southwest  Alberta.  The  Canadian  assets are
geographically concentrated,  predominantly shallow gas and more than 95 percent
operated by the Company in the  following  areas:  Chinchaga,  Martin  Creek and
Lookout Butte.

     Production  from  the  Chinchaga  area in  northeast  British  Columbia  is
relatively dry gas from  formation  depths  averaging  3,400 feet. In the Martin
Creek area of British  Columbia,  production is relatively  dry gas from various
reservoirs  ranging  from 3,700 feet to 4,300 feet.  The  Lookout  Butte area in
southwest  Alberta  produces gas and condensate  from the  Mississippian  Turner
Valley formation at approximately 12,000 feet.

     During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company expended $53.0 million
on Canadian exploration,  development,  and acquisition activities.  The Company
drilled 14 development wells and 42  exploratory/extension  wells,  primarily in
the Chinchaga and Martin Creek areas,  of which seven  development  wells and 16
exploratory/extension  wells were  successful.  Most of these wells were drilled
during the first quarter of 2003 as these areas are only accessible for drilling
during the winter months.  The Company plans to spend  approximately $31 million
on oil and gas development and exploration opportunities in Canada during 2004.

     Africa.  In Africa,  the Company has entered into agreements to explore for
oil and gas in South  Africa,  Gabon and  Tunisia.  The  amended  South  African
agreements  cover over five  million  acres  along the  southern  coast of South
Africa, generally in water depths less than 650 feet. The Gabon agreement covers
313,937  acres off the coast of Gabon,  generally  in water depths less than 100
feet. The Tunisian  agreements can be separated into two  categories:  the first
includes three permits covering 2.9 million acres onshore southern Tunisia which
the Company  operates with a 50 percent working interest and the second includes
the Anadarko-operated Anaguid permit covering 1.2 million acres onshore southern
Tunisia  in which  the  Company  has a 38.7  percent  working  interest  and the
AGIP-operated  Adam concession and Borj El Khadra permit covering  212,420 acres
and 969,755 acres,  respectively,  onshore southern Tunisia in which the Company
has a 28 percent and 40 percent working interest, respectively.  During the year
ended  December 31, 2003,  the Company  expended  $52.9 million of  acquisition,
development and exploration  drilling and seismic capital in South Africa, Gabon
and Tunisia.

     South Africa.  In South Africa,  the Company spent $32.8 million of capital
to complete its Petro SA-operated  Sable development  project and to drill three
exploratory  wells that were dry holes.  The Sable oil field began  producing in
August 2003. The Company has a 40% working interest in the Sable field. In 2004,
the Company  currently plans to spend  approximately  $9 million in South Africa
for production  enhancement  opportunities  at Sable and for an exploration well
late in the year.

     Gabon. In Gabon,  the Company spent $4.4 million of development and seismic
capital to further evaluate its Bigorneau South  discovery,  located offshore in
the  Southern  Gabon Basin on its Olowi  permit.  Pioneer is the operator of the
permit with a 100 percent  working  interest.  To date,  the Company has drilled
four successful offshore wells which have established  significant oil in place.
The Company recently received ministerial approval for improved terms associated
with the Olowi  permit.  Subsequent  to year end,  the Company  has  commenced a
multi-well  drilling program to further define the scale of a development  plan,
initially  focusing on the Lower Gamba, and to test a new exploratory  prospect.
The Company is also soliciting bids from possible new partners in the project.

     Tunisia.  In Tunisia,  the  Company  spent  $15.6  million of  acquisition,
drilling and seismic  capital  during the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily
to drill one successful development well in its Adam concession,  one successful
exploratory  well in its  AGIP-operated  Hawa oil field and one exploratory well
that was a dry hole in its  Company-operated  Jorf  permit.  The Hawa oil  field
started  production in January  2004. In addition,  the Company also drilled two
exploratory  wells  on its  Anadarko-operated  Anaguid  permit  that  remain  in
progress as of December 31, 2003. The Company also completed the construction of
a 15 kilometer  flowline from the Adam discovery to an  AGIP-operated  facility,
allowing  production to begin in May 2003. The capital  budget of  approximately
$14 million for Tunisia in 2004  includes an  exploration  well and  development
well in the Adam concession,  two exploration  wells on the Company- operated El
Hamra permit and two appraisal wells on the Anaguid permit.






Selected Oil and Gas Information

     The following  tables set forth  selected oil and gas  information  for the
Company as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001.
Because  of  normal  production   declines,   increased  or  decreased  drilling
activities and the effects of past and future acquisitions or divestitures,  the
historical  information  presented  below  should  not be  interpreted  as being
indicative of future results.

     Production, price and cost data. The following table sets forth production,
price and cost data with respect to the Company's properties for the years ended

ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
            RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2003 Highlights

     Pioneer's  financial and operating  results for the year ended December 31,
2003 included the following highlights:

o    Production  volumes  increased  36  percent  in 2003 as  compared  to 2002,
     principally due to the completion of the Canyon  Express,  Falcon and Sable
     development projects.

o    Oil and gas  revenue  increased  85  percent  in  2003 as a  result  of the
     increased  production  volumes  and  increases  in North  American  gas and
     worldwide oil prices.

o    Pre-tax income increased to $330.8 million from $31.8 million in 2002.

o    Pioneer's  solid progress  towards its strategic  objectives  over the past
     four years and  improving  key  economic  indicators,  together  with other
     relevant factors and associated evaluations, led the Company to reverse its
     allowances  against  United  States  deferred tax assets  during 2003.  The
     reversal  of the  allowances  against  United  States  deferred  tax assets
     resulted in the  recognition  of a deferred  tax benefit of $197.7  million
     during 2003 of which $104.7  million was  reversed in the third  quarter of
     2003 (see Note P of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements included in
     "Item 8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for  additional
     information  regarding the reversal of the allowances against the Company's
     United States deferred tax assets).

o    Net cash provided by operating  activities  increased 130 percent to $763.7
     million in 2003 as compared to $332.2 million in 2002.

o    The Company replaced its $575 million  revolving credit facility with a new
     five-year  $700 million  revolving  credit  agreement with terms similar to
     investment grade companies.

o    The  Company  participated  in  exploration  discoveries  in  the  Harrier,
     Tomahawk  and Raptor  fields in the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico and the Hawa
     field in Tunisia.

o    The Company  completed a strategic  acquisition of the remaining 25 percent
     working  interest that the Company did not already own in the Falcon field,
     Harrier field and surrounding satellite prospects.

o    The Company was the high bidder on 53 tracts covering an additional 159,000
     acres on the Alaskan North Slope.

o    The Company succeeded in obtaining  ministerial approval for improved terms
     associated  with  the Olowi permit in Gabon and booked 16.6 MMBOE of proved
     reserves in Gabon during 2003.

o    The  Company's  successful  capital  investment  programs  resulted  in the
     replacement  of 193 percent and 216 percent of  production  during the one-
     and three-year periods ended December 31, 2003, respectively,  resulting in
     total proved reserves of 789.1 MMBOE at December 31, 2003.

o    The Company  reported  acquisition  and finding  costs per BOE of $6.64 and
     $6.76  during the one- and  three-year  periods  ended  December  31, 2003,
     respectively.

2003 Financial and Operating Performance

     During the years  ended  December  31,  2003,  2002 and 2001,  the  Company
recorded net income of $410.6 million,  $26.7 million and $100.0 million ($3.46,
$.23 and $1.00 per diluted share), respectively. Compared to 2002, the Company's
2003 total revenues and other income increased by $594.8 million, or 83 percent,
including a $596.9 million increase in oil and gas revenues. The increase in oil







and gas revenues was due to increases in production  volumes and increases of 12
percent,  40  percent  and 53  percent  in  average  oil,  NGL and  gas  prices,
respectively, including the effects of commodity price hedges.

     Compared to 2002,  the  Company's  total costs and  expenses  increased  by
$295.8  million,  or 43 percent,  during the year ended  December 31, 2003.  The
increase in total costs and expenses was primarily reflective of a $46.9 million
increase in exploration  and  abandonments  expense,  primarily due to increased
exploration/extension  drilling  in the Gulf of  Mexico,  Argentina,  Canada and
South  Africa,  a  $174.5  million  increase  in  depletion,   depreciation  and
amortization expense, primarily driven by increases in depletion associated with
increased  production  volumes from  higher-cost-basis  Gulf of Mexico and South
Africa properties and an $80.0 million increase in oil and gas production costs,
which primarily resulted from increases in production volumes, the strengthening
of both the  Argentine  peso and  Canadian  dollar  and  commodity  prices  that
impacted  variable  lease  operating  expenses and production  taxes,  partially
offset by an $18.3  million  decrease in other  expense,  primarily due to $22.3
million of losses recognized during 2002 associated with debt extinguished prior
to its stated maturity.

     During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's net cash provided by
operating  activities increased to $763.7 million, as compared to $332.2 million
during 2002 and $475.6 million during 2001. The increase in net cash provided by
operating  activities during 2003 was primarily due to increases in oil, NGL and
gas production volumes and prices, as discussed above.

     During the year ended  December 31,  2003,  successful  capital  investment
activities  increased the Company's  proved reserves to 789.1 MMBOE,  reflecting
the effects of  strategic  acquisitions  of  properties  in the  Company's  core
operating  areas  and a  successful  drilling  program  which  resulted  in  the
replacement of 193 percent of production at an acquisition  and finding cost per
BOE of $6.64.  During the three  years  ended  December  31,  2003,  Pioneer has
replaced 216 percent of production at an acquisition and finding cost per BOE of
$6.76.  Costs  incurred  for the year ended  December  31, 2003  totaled  $723.0
million,  including $151.0 million of proved and unproved property  acquisitions
and  $572.0  million  of  exploration  and  development   drilling  and  seismic
expenditures.

     See "Results of Operations" and "Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and
Liquidity",  below, for more in- depth  discussions of the Company's oil and gas
producing activities, including discussions pertaining to oil and gas production
volumes,  prices, hedging activities,  costs and expenses,  capital commitments,
capital resources and liquidity.

2004 Outlook

     Commodity prices. World oil prices increased during the year ended December
31, 2003 in response to political  unrest and supply  disruptions  in the Middle
East as well as other supply and demand factors.  North American gas prices also
increased  during  2003 in  response  to  continued  strong  supply  and  demand
fundamentals.  The  Company's  outlook for 2004  commodity  prices is cautiously
optimistic.  Significant  factors that will impact 2004 commodity prices include
developments  in Iraq and  other  Middle  East  countries,  the  extent to which
members of the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  and other oil
exporting  nations  are able to manage  oil  supply  through  export  quotas and
variations in key North American gas supply and demand indicators.  Pioneer will
continue to strategically hedge oil and gas price risk to mitigate the impact of
price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues.

     As of December  31,  2003,  the Company had hedged  18,973  barrels per day
of 2004 oil production  under swap contracts with a weighted average fixed price
to be  received of $25.84 per Bbl.  The Company had also hedged  283,962 Mcf per
day of 2004 gas production  under swap  contracts with a weighted  average fixed
price to be  received  of $4.16 per MMBtu.  During  January  2004,  the  Company
increased its 2004 commodity hedge positions by entering into 32,967 Mcf per day
of first  quarter gas swap  contracts  with  average  per MMBtu fixed  prices of
$7.11. Additionally,  at December 31, 2003 the Company had net deferred gains on
terminated  oil hedge  contracts  of $1.0  million  that will be  recognized  as
increases to oil revenue  during 2004 and $42.9 million of net deferred gains on
terminated  gas hedge  contracts  that will be  recognized  as  increases to gas
revenue during 2004. See Note J of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional
information  regarding the Company's  commodity  hedge positions at December 31,
2003. Also see "Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About Market
Risk" for disclosures about the Company's commodity related derivative financial
instruments.







     Capital  expenditures.  During 2004,  the Company's  budget for oil and gas
capital  activities is expected to range from $550 million to $600  million,  of
which  approximately  65 percent has been budgeted for development  drilling and
facility costs and 35 percent for exploration  expenditures.  The Company's 2004
capital budget is allocated  approximately  70 percent to the United States,  19
percent to Argentina and the  remaining 11 percent is budgeted for  expenditures
in Canada, Gabon, Tunisia, South Africa and other foreign areas. Pioneer expects
to drill approximately 400 exploration and development wells during 2004. During
2004 and 2005, the Company expects to expend approximately $219 million and $348
million,  respectively,  of capital for development  drilling and facility costs
related to its proved undeveloped reserves.

     Production  growth.  The Company  expects  that its annual  2004  worldwide
production  will range from 65 MMBOE to 73 MMBOE, or  approximately  178 MBOE to
200 MBOE per day, an increase of 15 percent to 29 percent over 2003 levels.  The
bottom end of the range  includes a full year of  production  from the Company's
deepwater  Gulf of Mexico Falcon and Harrier gas fields,  the Sable oil field in
South Africa and the Hawa field in Tunisia, coupled with increases in production
from  the  Company's  2004  capital  program  and the  inherent  variability  in
production  results.  The Company  expects,  based on quoted futures prices,  to
generate  cash  flow  significantly  in excess of its  capital  program  and has
considered  the potential to invest a portion of the excess cash for  additional
development drilling or core area acquisitions in arriving at the top end of the
2004 production range.

     The outlook for continued  production growth in 2005 is strong  considering
that first  production from several new projects is not expected until well into
2004.  The Company will have its first full year of  production  from the Devils
Tower,  Tomahawk  and Raptor  deepwater  fields  during  2005,  and the  Company
believes it has sufficient development inventory to support production growth in
the United States, Argentina, Canada and Tunisia. As a result, Pioneer currently
expects production in 2005 to match 2004 at a minimum,  with considerable upside
given the potential  investment  of excess cash flow to develop new  exploration
successes and/or acquire additional assets in core areas during 2004 and 2005.

     Longer term,  with several  discoveries  to develop for 2006 and beyond,  a
pipeline  of  exploration  opportunities,  potential  for  continued  core  area
acquisitions,  continuing  strong commodity  prices and significant  excess cash
flow, Pioneer has targeted five-year average compounded annual production growth
of ten percent.

     Costs and  expenses.  The Company  expects that its costs and expenses that
are highly  correlated with  production  volumes,  such as production  costs and
depletion expense, will increase in absolute amounts during 2004.  Additionally,
the Company  expects that  depletion  expense  will  increase on a per BOE basis
during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to new  production  from Harrier,  Tomahawk,
Raptor and Devils Tower  fields in the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico and  increased
production  from the Sable oil field  offshore  South  Africa.  The per BOE cost
bases of these  fields  are  higher  than that of  Pioneer's  average  producing
property in 2003.  Additionally,  the  average  per BOE lifting  costs of Devils
Tower and Sable  oil field  production  are  expected  to exceed  the  Company's
average  2003  per BOE  lifting  costs.  The  Company  expects  average  per BOE
production  taxes to decline  during 2004 as compared to 2003 as the  production
from the  aforementioned  properties are not burdened by such taxes.  Ad valorem
taxes are highly  correlated with prior year commodity  prices. As a consequence
of  increases  in oil,  NGL and gas prices  during  2003,  ad valorem  taxes are
expected to be higher in 2004, as compared to 2003.  The Company  anticipates an
increase in general and  administrative  expenses  during 2004 due to additional
staffing  and the  amortization  of  restricted  stock that is being  awarded to
officers  and  employees in lieu of stock  options,  which were awarded in prior
years.

     Capital  allocation.  Four years ago, the Company made a commitment to move
its  financial   position  to  investment  grade   standards,   and  significant
improvement has been accomplished  during that period with year-end 2003 debt to
book capitalization reaching 46.9 percent as compared to 69.3 percent at the end
of  1999.  The  Company  has  established  a  targeted  range  for  debt to book
capitalization  of 37  percent  to 43  percent.  Given the  expanding  financial
strength of the Company and  expectations for significant cash flow in excess of
its capital budget, the Company expects to use a portion of its excess cash flow
in  2004  to  further  reduce  long-term  debt by a  minimum  of  $100  million.
Additionally,  the Company' s Board of Directors have approved a plan to begin a
dividend  program  of  $.20  per  common  share,   payable  in  two  semi-annual
installments of $.10 per common share, beginning in 2004.







     During 2004 through  2006,  the Company  anticipates,  based upon  year-end
futures  prices,  that it will have  significant  excess  cash  flow even  after
funding its typical annual capital budgets,  planned dividends and achieving its
leverage targets.  The Company considers it a high priority to utilize a portion
of the excess cash flow to fund the development of new exploration successes and
to selectively  acquire  additional  assets in its core areas.  The Company will
also consider using a portion of the excess cash flow for share repurchases.

     First quarter 2004.  Based on current  estimates,  the Company expects that
its first quarter 2004  production will average 168,000 to 183,000 BOEs per day,
reflecting  the  incremental  production  from Harrier which began  producing in
January,  the variability of oil cargo shipments in Tunisia and South Africa and
the seasonal  decline in gas demand  during  Argentina's  summer  season.  First
quarter production costs are expected to average $5.00 to $5.50 per BOE based on
current  NYMEX  strip  prices  for  oil  and  gas.  Deprecation,  depletion  and
amortization  expense is expected to average $7.75 to $8.25 per BOE as a greater
proportion of the Company's  production is being produced from higher-cost basis
deepwater  Gulf of Mexico and South Africa  properties.  Total  exploration  and
abandonment  expense is  expected to be $25  million to $85  million.  The first
quarter range  includes a number of  high-impact  deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells
that are in  progress,  up to five wells  expected  in Gabon to  further  refine
development  plans  and test a new  exploration  target,  increased  exploration
drilling in Argentina  and the winter  drilling  program in Canada.  General and
administrative  expense is expected to be $17 million to $20 million, $2 million
to $3 million of which  relates to  estimated  performance-  based  compensation
costs.  Interest  expense  is  expected  to be $21  million to $23  million  and
accretion  of  discount  on  asset  retirement  obligations  is  expected  to be
approximately  $2  million.   The  Company  recognizes   deferred  income  taxes
reflecting  its tax position in each of its areas of  operation.  However,  cash
income  taxes are  expected  to be only $3  million to $5  million,  principally
related to  Argentine  income taxes and nominal  alternative  minimum tax in the
United States.  Other than in Argentina,  the Company  continues to benefit from
the carryforward of net operating losses and other positive tax attributes.

Critical Accounting Estimates

     The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in
this Report in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted
in the United States  ("GAAP").  See Note B of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for
a comprehensive  discussion of the Company's  significant  accounting  policies.
GAAP  represents a  comprehensive  set of accounting  and  disclosure  rules and
requirements,  the  application  of  which  requires  management  judgments  and
estimates including,  in certain circumstances,  choices between acceptable GAAP
alternatives.   Following  is  a  discussion  of  the  Company's  most  critical
accounting  estimates,  judgments  and  uncertainties  that are  inherent in the
Company's application of GAAP:

     Accounting  for oil and gas producing  activities.  The  accounting for and
disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the Company's management
to choose between GAAP  alternatives  and to make judgments  about  estimates of
future uncertainties.

     Successful   efforts  method  of  accounting.   The  Company  utilizes  the
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing  activities as
opposed to the alternate  acceptable full cost method.  In general,  the Company
believes that, during periods of active  exploration,  net assets and net income
are  more  conservatively  measured  under  the  successful  efforts  method  of
accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method.
The critical  difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and
the full  cost  method  is as  follows:  under the  successful  efforts  method,
exploratory  dry holes and  geological  and  geophysical  exploration  costs are
charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas,  under
the full cost method of accounting,  such costs and expenses are  capitalized as
assets,  pooled  with the costs of  successful  wells and  charged  against  the
earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During the years
ended  December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001,  the Company  recognized  exploration,
abandonment, geological and geophysical expense of $132.8 million, $85.9 million
and $127.9 million, respectively, under the successful efforts method.

     Proved  reserve  estimates.  Estimates  of the  Company's  proved  reserves
included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines.
The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:

       o      the quality and quantity of available data;
       o      the interpretation of that data;








       o      the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and
       o      the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.

     The  Company's  proved  reserve  information  included in this Report as of
December  31,  2003 and 2002 was based on  evaluations  audited  by  independent
petroleum  engineers with respect to the Company's major properties and prepared
by the Company's  engineers with respect to all other properties.  The Company's
proved reserve  information  included in this Report as of December 31, 2001 was
based on evaluations prepared by the Company's engineers.  Estimates prepared by
other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein.

     Because  these  estimates  depend  on many  assumptions,  all of which  may
substantially  differ from future  actual  results,  reserve  estimates  will be
different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately  recovered.  In
addition,  results of  drilling,  testing  and  production  after the date of an
estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate.

     It should not be assumed  that the  present  value of future net cash flows
included in this Report as of December  31, 2003 is the current  market value of
the Company's  estimated proved reserves.  In accordance with SEC  requirements,
the  Company  based the  estimated  present  value of future net cash flows from
proved  reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate.  Actual future
prices and costs may be materially  higher or lower than the prices and costs as
of the date of the estimate.

     The Company's  estimates of proved  reserves  materially  impact  depletion
expense.  If the  estimates of proved  reserves  decline,  the rate at which the
Company  records  depletion  expense will increase,  reducing future net income.
Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic
to drill for and produce  higher cost fields.  In addition,  a decline in proved
reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Company's  assessment of its oil
and gas producing properties for impairment.

     Impairment  of proved  oil and gas  properties.  The  Company  reviews  its
long-lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management  determines
that events or  circumstances  indicate that the recorded  carrying value of the
properties  may  not  be  recoverable.  Management  assesses  whether  or not an
impairment  provision  is necessary  based upon its outlook of future  commodity
prices and net cash flows that may be  generated by the  properties.  Proved oil
and gas properties are reviewed for impairment by depletable  pool, which is the
lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated.

     Impairment  of unproved  oil and gas  properties.  Management  periodically
assesses   individually   significant   unproved  oil  and  gas  properties  for
impairment,  on a  project-by-project  basis.  Management's  assessment  of  the
results of exploration  activities,  commodity  price  outlooks,  planned future
sales or expiration  of all or a portion of such projects  impact the amount and
timing of impairment provisions.

     Suspended wells.  The Company suspends the costs of exploratory  wells that
discover  hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential
of the related oil and gas fields. The ultimate  disposition of these well costs
is  dependent  on the  results  of  future  drilling  activity  and  development
decisions.  If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities
or  development  of these  fields,  the costs of these  wells will be charged to
exploration and abandonment expense. At December 31, 2003, the Company had $88.6
million of suspended  exploratory  well costs  included in  property,  plant and
equipment.

     Assessments of functional currencies.  Management determines the functional
currencies of the Company's  subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency
of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends
its operating  revenues,  costs and expenses.  The U.S. dollar is the functional
currency of all of the Company's  international  operations  except Canada.  The
assessment of functional  currencies  can have a significant  impact on periodic
results of operations and financial position.

     Argentine   economic  and  currency   measures.   The  accounting  for  and
remeasurement of the Company's  Argentine balance sheets as of December 31, 2003
and 2002 reflect management's assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to
Argentina's  current  economic  situation.  See Note B of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for a description of the assumptions  utilized in the preparation of these
financial  statements.  The Argentine economic and political situation continues








to evolve and the Argentine  government may enact future regulations or policies
that, when finalized and adopted,  may materially impact, among other items, (i)
the realized  prices the Company  receives for the  commodities  it produces and
sells;  (ii) the timing of  repatriations  of excess cash flow to the  Company's
corporate   headquarters  in  the  United  States;  (iii)  the  Company's  asset
valuations; and (iv) peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.

     Deferred tax asset valuation allowances.  From 1998 until 2003, the Company
maintained  a valuation  allowance  against a portion of its  deferred tax asset
position in the United  States.  SFAS 109 requires that the Company  continually
assess both  positive  and  negative  evidence to  determine  whether it is more
likely  than not that the  deferred  tax assets can be  realized  prior to their
expiration.  In the third  quarter  of 2003 and as of  December  31,  2003,  the
Company concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize its gross
deferred tax asset position in the United States after giving  consideration  to
relevant facts and circumstances.

     Accordingly,  during the third  quarter of 2003,  the Company  reversed its
remaining valuation allowance in the United States, resulting in the recognition
of a deferred  tax  benefit of $104.7  million.  For 2003 in total,  the Company
reversed $197.7 million of United States valuation allowances resulting in a net
deferred tax benefit for the year.  Further,  the third quarter 2003 reversal of
the  allowance  increased  stockholders'  equity by $32.6 million as the Company
recognized  the tax effects of previous  stock  option  exercises  and  deferred
hedging gains and losses in other  comprehensive  income. See Note P of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data" for additional  information  regarding the Company's United
States  deferred tax assets and a specific  discussion of the relevant facts and
circumstances that were assessed.

     Pioneer will continue to monitor Company-specific, oil and gas industry and
worldwide  economic  factors and will reassess the likelihood that the Company's
net  operating  loss  carryforwards  and other  deferred tax  attributes in each
jurisdiction  will be  utilized  prior  to  their  expiration.  There  can be no
assurances that facts and  circumstances  will not materially change and require
the  Company  to  reestablish  a United  States  deferred  tax  asset  valuation
allowance in a future  period.  As of December  31,  2003,  the Company does not
believe  there  is  sufficient   positive  evidence  to  reverse  its  valuation
allowances related to foreign tax jurisdictions.

     Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and
estimates in recording  liabilities  for ongoing  litigation  and  environmental
remediation. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons.
The  costs to  settle  litigation  can vary from  estimates  based on  differing
interpretations  of laws and opinions and  assessments on the amount of damages.
Similarly,  environmental  remediation liabilities are subject to change because
of changes in laws, regulations, additional information obtained relating to the
extent and nature of site  contamination  and improvements in technology.  Under
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in the United  States  ("GAAP"),  a
liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines
the loss to be both probable and  reasonably  estimated.  See Note I of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary   Data"  for  additional   information   regarding  the  Company's
commitments and contingencies.

Results of Operations

     Oil and gas  revenues.  Revenues from oil and gas  operations  totaled $1.3
billion  during  2003,  as  compared  to $701.8  million  during 2002 and $847.0
million during 2001,  representing an 85 percent increase from 2002 to 2003. The
revenue  increase  from  2002 to 2003 was due to a 36  percent  increase  in BOE
production,  a 12 percent  increase in oil prices,  a 40 percent increase in NGL
prices  and a 53  percent  increase  in gas  prices,  including  the  effects of
commodity price hedges. The increased production is principally  attributable to
incremental  gas production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico Canyon Express and
Falcon field  projects,  initial oil  production in South Africa and Tunisia and
increased  oil and gas  production  in  Argentina,  offset by normal  production
declines.  The  revenue  decrease  from  2001 to  2002  was  principally  due to
year-on-year  worldwide average oil, NGL and gas price declines of five percent,
19 percent  and 23 percent,  respectively,  including  the effects of  commodity
price  hedges,  and an  eight  percent  decline  in  worldwide  oil  production,
partially  offset by worldwide NGL and gas production  increases of four percent
and two percent, respectively.







     The  following  table  provides  production  volumes and  average  reported
prices,  including the results of hedging activities,  by geographic area and in
total, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:


     Hedging  activities.  The oil and gas prices that the  Company  reports are
based on the market price received for the  commodities  adjusted by the results
of the Company's cash flow hedging  activities.  The Company utilizes  commodity
swap and collar  contracts in order to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility
on the  commodities the Company  produces and sells,  (ii) support the Company's
annual capital  budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price
risk associated with certain capital projects. The effective portions of changes
in the fair  values of the  Company's  commodity  price  hedges are  deferred as
increases or  decreases to  stockholders'  equity  until the  underlying  hedged
transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective portions of commodity
price hedges add volatility to the Company's reported stockholders' equity until






the  hedge  derivative  matures  or  is  terminated.  See  Note  J of  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data"  for  information  concerning  the  impact  to oil  and gas
revenues  during  the years  ended  December  31,  2003,  2002 and 2001 from the
Company's hedging activities, the Company's open hedge positions at December 31,
2003  and   descriptions  of  the  Company's   hedge  and  non-hedge   commodity
derivatives.  Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About
Market Risk" for additional  disclosure  about the Company's  commodity  related
derivative financial instruments.

     Interest and other income.  The Company recorded  interest and other income
totaling $12.3 million,  $11.2 million and $21.8 during the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  The Company's interest and other income
was  comprised  of revenue  that was not  directly  attributable  to oil and gas
producing activities or oil and gas property  divestitures.  See Note M of Notes
to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data" for additional  information regarding interest and other
income.

     Gain on  disposition  of assets.  During the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001,  the Company  completed  asset  divestitures  for net proceeds of
$35.7  million,  $118.9  million and $113.5  million,  respectively.  Associated
therewith,  the Company recorded gains on disposition of assets of $1.3 million,
$4.4 million and $7.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

     The net cash  proceeds  from  asset  divestitures  during  the years  ended
December  31,  2003,  2002 and 2001  were  used,  together  with net cash  flows
provided by operating  activities,  to fund  additions to oil and gas properties
and to  reduce  outstanding  indebtedness.  See Note N of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures.

     Oil and gas production  costs.  The Company  recorded  production  costs of
$279.5  million,  $199.6  million  and $209.7  million  during  the years  ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in total production
costs during 2003 as compared to 2002 is primarily  attributable to the increase
in production volumes,  while the decrease in total production costs during 2002
as compared to 2001 is  principally  attributable  to lower  production  tax and
field fuel expenses due to lower commodity prices.

     Total production costs per BOE increased during the year ended December 31,
2003 by three percent and decreased  during the year ended  December 31, 2002 by
four  percent.  In general,  lease  operating  expenses  and  workover  expenses
represent the components of oil and gas production  costs over which the Company
has management control,  while production taxes, ad valorem taxes and field fuel
expenses  are  directly  related to  commodity  price  changes.  The increase in
production  costs per BOE during 2003 was  primarily due to increases in per BOE
lease operating  expenses,  field fuel expenses and production taxes,  partially
offset by  decreases  in per BOE ad valorem  taxes and  workover  expenses.  The
increase in per BOE lease  operating  expenses was due to the  strengthening  of
both the Argentine peso and the Canadian dollar,  Argentine inflation and higher
average  lifting costs  incurred on South  African  Sable oil field  production,
while  the  increases  in per BOE  field  fuel  expenses  and  production  taxes
primarily  resulted  from  increases in North  American gas prices and world oil
prices.  The  decrease  in per BOE ad  valorem  taxes  is  primarily  due to the
incremental  production  from the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico,  Argentina,  South
Africa and Tunisia fields which are not subject to ad valorem taxes.

     The decrease in production costs during 2002 was primarily due to decreases
in field fuel expense and  production  taxes as a result of lower North American
average gas prices and lower Argentine lease operating  expenses  resulting from
lower  Argentine  expenses  on  a  U.S.  dollar  equivalent  basis  due  to  the
devaluation of the Argentine peso versus the U.S.  dollar,  partially  offset by
moderately higher workover expenses,  ad valorem taxes (which are computed using
prior year average annual commodity  prices) and declines in the third party gas
processing and treating margin component of lease operating expense.






       The following tables provide the components of the Company's total
production costs per BOE and total production costs per BOE by geographic area
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:




     Depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization  expense.  The Company's  total
depletion,  depreciation and amortization  expense per BOE was $6.92,  $5.22 and
$5.35  for the years  ended  December  31,  2003,  2002 and 2001,  respectively.
Depletion  expense,  the  largest  component  of  depletion,   depreciation  and
amortization, was $6.75, $5.01 and $5.02 per BOE during the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  and  depreciation  and  amortization of
other property and equipment was $.17,  $.21 and $.33 per BOE during each of the
respective years. During 2003, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was due
to increases in higher  cost-basis  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico and South  African
production volumes and downward revisions to proved reserves in Canada.

     The following table provides  depletion  expense per BOE by geographic area
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:







     Exploration,  abandonments,  geological and geophysical costs. Exploration,
abandonments,  geological and geophysical  costs totaled $132.8  million,  $85.9
million and $127.9 million  during the years ended  December 31, 2003,  2002 and
2001,  respectively.  The  following  table  sets  forth the  components  of the
Company's  exploration,   abandonments,  geological  and  geophysical  costs  by
geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:


     The increase in 2003 exploration,  abandonments, geological and geophysical
expense,  as compared to 2002,  was  primarily due to increased  geological  and
geophysical  expenditures  supportive of  exploration  activities in the Gulf of
Mexico and Alaska and a $24.4 million  increase in exploratory dry hole expense.
The increase in exploratory dry hole expense during 2003 was primarily due to an
increase in Canadian  exploratory  drilling  activities  and three  unsuccessful
wells drilled in South Africa and one unsuccessful well drilled in Tunisia.

     The decrease in 2002 exploration,  abandonments, geological and geophysical
expense reflected a decline in Argentine  exploration  activities as the Company
monitored  and assessed  the  economic  environment  and risks  associated  with
Argentina;  a decline in exploratory  dry holes and  geological and  geophysical
expense in Africa,  as the Company  assessed its exploratory  successes in Gabon
and Tunisia;  and the  allocation of a larger  percentage of the Company's  2002
capital budget to the development of its significant  discoveries in the Gulf of
Mexico and offshore South Africa.

     Approximately  38 percent of the Company's  2003 costs incurred for oil and
gas producing  activities  were  exploration  costs as compared to 20 percent in
2002 and 34 percent in 2001.

     General   and   administrative   expenses.   The   Company's   general  and
administrative  expenses  totaled $60.5 million  ($1.07 per BOE),  $48.4 million
($1.17 per BOE) and $37.0 million ($.89 per BOE) during the years ended December
31,   2003,   2002  and  2001,   respectively.   The  increase  in  general  and
administrative  expense  during 2003, as compared to 2002,  was primarily due to
increases in administrative  staff and  performance-related  compensation costs,
including the  amortization of restricted  stock awarded to officers,  directors
and key employees during 2003 and 2002.

     The increase in  administrative  expense during the year ended December 31,
2002 as compared  to 2001 was  primarily  due to the  elimination  of  operating
overhead  being  charged by the Company to the 42 affiliated  partnerships  that
were merged into a wholly-owned  subsidiary of the Company during  December 2001
and amortization of restricted stock awarded in 2002.

     See Notes D and G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information  regarding
the affiliated  partnership  mergers and the restricted stock awards in 2003 and
2002 and their vesting periods, respectively.









     Accretion  of discount  on asset  retirement  obligations.  During the year
ended  December  31, 2003 the Company  recorded  accretion  of discount on asset
retirement obligations of $5.0 million. The provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 143,  "Accounting  for Asset  Retirement  Obligations"
("SFAS  143")  require  that the  accretion  of  discount  on  asset  retirement
obligations be classified in the consolidated  statement of operations  separate
from interest  expense.  Prior to 2003 and the adoption of SFAS 143, the Company
classified accretion of discount on asset retirement  obligations as a component
of interest  expense.  The Company's  interest  expense during each of the years
ended  December 31, 2002 and 2001 included $2.6 million of accretion of discount
on asset  retirement  obligations  that was calculated  prior to the adoption of
SFAS 143 based on asset retirement  obligations  recorded in purchased  business
combinations.  See "Cumulative  effect of change in accounting  principle" below
and Notes B and L of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in
"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information
regarding the Company's adoption of SFAS 143.

     Interest  expense.  Interest  expense was $91.4 million,  $95.8 million and
$132.0  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2003,  2002 and 2001,
respectively,  while  the  weighted  average  interest  rate  on  the  Company's
indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 5.3 percent as compared to
5.7 percent and 7.5  percent  for the years  ended  December  31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively,  taking  into  account  the effect of  interest  rate  swaps.  The
decrease in interest  expense for 2003 as compared to 2002 was  primarily due to
$4.8 million of interest  savings  associated  with the July 2002 repayment of a
$45.2 million West Panhandle gas field capital  obligation  (the "West Panhandle
Capital  Obligation") which bore interest at an annual rate of 20 percent;  $4.1
million of incremental savings from the Company's interest rate hedging program;
a $2.6 million  decrease in accretion  expense  (see  "Accretion  of discount on
asset retirement  obligations",  above);  and lower  underlying  market interest
rates and  outstanding  debt.  Partially  offsetting  the  decreases in interest
expense  was a $6.8  million  decrease in  interest  capitalized  during 2003 as
compared to 2002 due to the  completion  of the Canyon  Express and Falcon field
development projects.

     The decline in 2002 interest expense as compared to 2001, was primarily due
to  incremental  interest  savings of $18.0 million from the Company's  interest
rate hedging program; a $6.3 million increase in interest capitalized;  interest
savings from the  retirement of the  Company's  outstanding  11-5/8  percent and
10-5/8  percent  senior  subordinated  notes during the third quarter of 2001and
$38.7  million of the  Company's  9-5/8  percent  senior notes during the fourth
quarter of 2001;  interest savings from the repurchase of $47.1 million of 9-5/8
percent  senior  notes and $13.9  million of 8-7/8  percent  senior notes during
2002;  interest savings from the repayment of West Panhandle Capital Obligation;
and interest savings from reductions in underlying market interest rates.

     See Note E of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about
the Company's long-term debt and interest expense.

     Other  expenses.  Other  expenses were $21.3 million  during the year ended
December 31, 2003,  as compared to $39.6  million  during 2002 and $43.3 million
during 2001. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included
in "Item 8.  Financial  Statements and  Supplementary  Data" for a detail of the
components included in other expenses.

     Income tax  provisions  (benefits).  The Company  recognized a consolidated
income tax benefit of $64.4 million  during the year ended December 31, 2003 and
consolidated  income tax  provisions of $5.1 million and $4.0 million during the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company's consolidated
tax benefit in 2003 was comprised of a $.1 million current United States federal
tax provision,  an $11.1 million  current  foreign  income tax provision,  $76.3
million of deferred United States federal and state tax benefits and $.7 million
of deferred foreign tax provisions.  The 2003 deferred United States federal and
state tax  benefits  include a $197.7  million  benefit from the reversal of the
Company's  valuation  allowances  against United States deferred tax assets,  of
which $104.7  million was reversed in the third  quarter of 2003. As a result of
the reversal of the valuation  allowances  against the  Company's  United States
deferred tax assets,  the effective tax rate on the Company's future earnings in
the United States will approximate statutory rates.







     The Company's  consolidated tax provision for 2002 was comprised of current
United  States state and local taxes of $.2 million,  current  foreign  taxes of
$2.1 million and deferred foreign tax provisions of $2.8 million.  The Company's
consolidated  tax  provision  for 2001 was  comprised of current U.S.  state and
local taxes of $1.1 million, current foreign taxes of $10.5 million and deferred
foreign tax benefits of $7.6 million.

     See  "Critical  Accounting   Estimates"  above  and  Note  P  of  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data" for  additional  information  regarding  the  Company's tax
position.

     Cumulative  effect  of  change  in  accounting  principle.   As  previously
discussed, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and
recognized  a $15.4  million  benefit  from the  cumulative  effect of change in
accounting  principle,  net of $1.3  million of  associated  Argentine  deferred
income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2003.

     On January 1, 2003, the Company also adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
and 64,  Amendment of FASB  Statement No. 13 and Technical  Corrections"  ("SFAS
145"), the provisions of which did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 145, the Company reclassified to other
expense  extraordinary  losses  from the early  extinguishment  of debt of $22.3
million and $3.8 million  realized  during the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

     See Note B of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item
8. Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for  additional  information
regarding the Company's adoption of SFAS 143 and SFAS 145.

Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity

     Capital  commitments.   The  Company's  primary  needs  for  cash  are  for
exploration,  development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties,  repayment
of contractual obligations and working capital funding. Funding for exploration,
development  and  acquisitions  of oil  and  gas  properties  and  repayment  of
contractual    obligations    may   be   provided   by   any    combination   of
internally-generated  cash flow,  proceeds from the disposition of non-strategic
assets or  alternative  financing  sources as discussed  in "Capital  resources"
below.  Funding for the Company's  working  capital  obligations  is provided by
internally-generated cash flows.

     Oil and gas properties.  The Company's cash  expenditures  for additions to
oil and gas properties  during the years ended December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001
totaled $688.1  million,  $614.7 million and $529.7 million,  respectively.  The
Company's  2003  expenditures  for  additions  to oil  and gas  properties  were
internally   funded  by  $763.7  million  of  net  cash  provided  by  operating
activities.  The  Company's  2002  expenditures  for  additions  to oil  and gas
properties  were  funded by $332.2  million of net cash  provided  by  operating
activities,  $118.9  million of proceeds  from the  disposition  of assets and a
portion  of the  proceeds  from  the  issuance  of 11.5  million  shares  of the
Company's common stock during April 2002. The Company's 2001  expenditures  were
internally funded by $475.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities
and a portion of the Company's  $113.5  million of proceeds from  disposition of
assets.

     The Company strives to maintain its  indebtedness  at reasonable  levels in
order to provide  sufficient  financial  flexibility to take advantage of future
opportunities.  The Company's  capital budget for 2004 is expected to range from
$550 million to $600  million.  The Company  believes  that net cash provided by
operating  activities  during 2004 will be  sufficient  to fund the 2004 capital
expenditures  budget  as well as  reduce  long-term  debt by a  minimum  of $100
million and fund the recently  approved plan to begin an annual dividend program
of $.20 per common share beginning in 2004. For additional information regarding
the Company's plans for 2004, see "2004 Outlook" above.

     Contractual  obligations,  including  off-balance  sheet  obligations.  The
Company's  contractual  obligations  include  long-term debt,  operating leases,
drilling commitments, derivative obligations and other liabilities. From time to
time, the Company enters into  off-balance  sheet  arrangements and transactions
that can give rise to material  off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As
of  December  31,  2003,  the  material   off-balance  sheet   arrangements  and
transactions  that the  Company has entered  into  include (i) $47.6  million of
undrawn  letters of credit,  (ii)  operating  lease  agreements,  (iii) drilling
commitments and (iv) contractual  obligations for which the ultimate  settlement
amounts  are not fixed  and determinable  such as derivative  contracts that are







sensitive  to  future  changes  in  commodity  prices  and  gas   transportation
commitments. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk"  for a table of  changes  in the fair  value of the  Company's  derivative
contract assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2003 and Note
I of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in "Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional  information  regarding future
minimum lease payments and gas transportation commitments.

     The following  table  summarizes  by period the Company's  payments due for
contractual obligations estimated as of December 31, 2003:


     Capital  resources.  The Company's  primary capital  resources are net cash
provided  by  operating  activities,  proceeds  from  financing  activities  and
proceeds  from sales of  non-strategic  assets.  The Company  expects that these
resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments in 2004.

     Operating activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities during the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $763.7 million, $332.2 million
and $475.6 million,  respectively.  Net cash provided by operating activities in
2003 increased by $431.5 million,  or 130 percent,  as compared to that of 2002.
The  increase in 2003 was  primarily  due to  increased  production  volumes and
higher  commodity  prices as compared to 2002.  Net cash  provided by  operating
activities in 2002 decreased by $143.4  million,  or 30 percent,  as compared to
that of 2001. The decrease in 2002 net cash provided by operating activities was
principally due to declines in commodity prices, offset partially by declines in
interest expense.

     Investing  activities.  Net cash used in  investing  activities  during the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001were $662.3 million,  $508.1 million
and  $422.7  million.  The $154.2  million  increase  in cash used in  investing
activities  during 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a $73.4 million
increase in additions to oil and gas properties and an $83.2 million decrease in
proceeds from disposition of assets.  The cash proceeds from asset  divestitures
during 2003 were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. The cash proceeds from
asset  divestitures  during  2002 and 2001 were  used to fund a  portion  of the
Company's  2002  and  2001  capital   expenditures  and  for  general  corporate
obligations.  See  "Results  of  Operations",  above,  and  Note N of  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures.








     Financing  activities.  Net cash used in financing activities totaled $91.7
million and $64.0  million  during the years ended  December  31, 2003 and 2001.
During the year ended December 31, 2002,  financing  activities  provided $170.9
million of net cash. During 2003,  financing activities were comprised of $105.5
million of net principle  payments on long-term debt,  $14.1 million of payments
of other noncurrent  liabilities,  $2.8 million of loan fees and $2.3 million of
treasury stock purchases, partially offset by $33.0 million of proceeds from the
exercise of long-term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases.
During 2002, the Company's financing activities were comprised of $236.0 million
of proceeds,  net of issuance costs, from the sale of 11.5 million shares of the
Company's  common stock;  $48.0 million of net borrowings of long-term debt; and
$14.4  million of proceeds from the exercise of long-term  incentive  plan stock
options and employee  stock  purchases,  partially  offset by $124.2  million of
payments  of other  noncurrent  liabilities  and $3.3  million of debt  issuance
costs.  During 2001, the Company's  financing  activities were comprised of $5.1
million  to repay  long-term  debt,  $53.4  million  to repay  other  noncurrent
liabilities and $13.0 million to purchase  treasury stock,  partially  offset by
$7.5 million of net cash provided from the exercise of long-term  incentive plan
stock options and employee stock purchases.

     Over the three year period ended December 31, 2003, the Company has entered
into financing  transactions with the intent of reducing its cost of capital and
increasing liquidity through the extension of debt maturities. See Notes E and J
of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in "Item 8. Financial
Statements and  Supplemental  Data" and "Item 7A.  Quantitative  and Qualitative
Disclosures  About Market Risk" for more  information  about the Company's  debt
instruments and interest rate hedging activities.

     The Company's future debt level is dependent primarily on net cash provided
by  operating  activities,  proceeds  from  financing  activities  and  proceeds
generated  from asset  dispositions.  The Company  believes  it has  substantial
borrowing capacity to meet any unanticipated  cash requirements,  and during low
commodity price periods,  the Company has the flexibility to increase borrowings
and/or  modify its capital  spending  to meet its  contractual  obligations  and
maintain its debt ratings.

     As the Company  pursues its  strategy,  it may  utilize  various  financing
sources,  including  fixed  and  floating  rate  debt,  convertible  securities,
preferred  stock or common  stock.  The  Company  may also issue  securities  in
exchange for oil and gas  properties,  stock or other interests in other oil and
gas  companies  or  related  assets.  Additional  securities  may be of a  class
preferred  to common  stock  with  respect  to such  matters  as  dividends  and
liquidation  rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined
by the Company's Board of Directors.

     Liquidity.  The Company's  principal source of short-term  liquidity is its
revolving credit facility.  During December 2003, the Company entered into a new
five-year revolving credit agreement (the "New Credit Facility") that matures in
December  2008.  The New Credit  Facility  replaced the  Company's  $575 million
revolving  credit  facility (the "Prior Credit  Facility")  that had a scheduled
maturity in March 2005. The terms of the New Credit Facility provide for initial
aggregate loan  commitments of $700 million from a syndication of  participating
banks (the "Lenders").  Aggregate loan commitments under the New Credit Facility
may be  increased  to a maximum  aggregate  amount of $1 billion if the  Lenders
increase  their  loan   commitments   or  loan   commitments  of  new  financial
institutions are added to the New Credit Facility.  Outstanding borrowings under
the New Credit Facility totaled $160 million as of December 31, 2003.  Including
$28.8 million of undrawn and outstanding  letters of credit under the New Credit
Facility,  the Company  has $511.2  million of unused  borrowing  capacity as of
December 31, 2003.

     Book capitalization and current ratio. The Company's book capitalization at
December  31,  2003 was $3.3  billion,  consisting  of debt of $1.6  billion and
stockholders'  equity of $1.7 billion. The Company's debt to book capitalization
was 46.9  percent at December  31, 2003 as compared to 54.8  percent at December
31, 2002. The Company's  ratio of current assets to current  liabilities was .48
at December 31, 2003 and .54 at December 31, 2002.  The decline in the Company's
ratio of current assets to current liabilities was primarily due to increases in
current hedge derivative obligations and trade payables. As more fully discussed
in "2004  Outlook"  above,  the  Company  has  targeted a range for debt to book
capitalization of between 37 percent and 43 percent.







New Accounting Development

     In its  recent  review of  registrants'  filings,  the staff of the SEC has
taken the position  that  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142,
"Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets"  ("SFAS  142"),  requires  oil and gas
entities to  separately  report on their  balance  sheets the costs of leasehold
mineral interests, including related accumulated depletion, as intangible assets
and provide related disclosures. The Company has historically included producing
leasehold costs in the proved properties  caption on its balance sheet since the
value of the leases is  inseparable  from the value of the  related  oil and gas
reserves.  This classification is consistent with the provisions of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 19, "Financial  Accounting and Reporting by
Oil and Gas Producing  Companies",  and standard industry  practice.  Almost all
costs  included in the  unproved  properties  caption on the  balance  sheet are
leasehold mineral interests that are regularly evaluated for impairment based on
lease term and  drilling  activity.  The SEC staff has  referred the question of
SFAS 142  applicability  for consideration by the Emerging Issues Task Force. If
the  provisions  of SFAS  142 are  determined  to be  applicable  to oil and gas
leasehold  mineral  interests,  reclassifications  within  property,  plant  and
equipment on the Consolidated  Balance Sheets and additional  disclosures may be
required.  As of December 31, 2003, the Company has not determined the amount of
such  reclassifications,  if  applicable.  The Company does not believe that the
provisions  of SFAS 142, if determined  to be  applicable,  will have a material
impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The following  quantitative  and qualitative  information is provided about
financial  instruments  to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2003
and 2002,  and from which the  Company  may incur  future  gains or losses  from
changes in market interest rates,  foreign  exchange rates or commodity  prices.
Although  certain  derivative  contracts  that the  Company is a party to do not
qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial
instruments for trading purposes.

     The fair value of the Company's  derivative  contracts are determined based
on  counterparties'  estimates and valuation models.  The Company did not change
its valuation  method during the year ended December 31, 2003.  During 2003, the
Company  was a party  to  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts,  commodity  and
interest rate swap contracts and commodity collar contracts. See Note J of Notes
to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
and  Supplementary  Data" for  additional  information  regarding  the Company's
derivative  contracts,   including  deferred  gains  and  losses  on  terminated
derivative  contracts.  The following table reconciles the changes that occurred
in the fair values of the Company's open derivative contracts during 2003:


Quantitative Disclosures

     Interest rate sensitivity.  The following tables provide  information about
other financial  instruments  that the Company was a party to as of December 31,
2003 and 2002 and that are or were sensitive to changes in interest  rates.  For
debt obligations,  the tables present maturities by expected maturity dates, the
weighted  average interest  rates expected to be paid  on the debt given current







contractual terms and market conditions and the debt's estimated fair value. For
fixed rate debt, the weighted  average  interest rate represents the contractual
fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002.  For variable rate debt,  the average  interest rate
represents  the  average  rates  being  paid  on  the  debt  projected   forward
proportionate to the forward yield curve for the six-month LIBOR.

                            Interest Rate Sensitivity

                    Debt Obligations as of December 31, 2002



     Foreign  exchange  rate  sensitivity.  There  were no  outstanding  foreign
exchange rate hedge  derivatives  at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002,
the Company  was a party to a foreign  exchange  rate  derivative  that  matured
during January 2003 as an $18 thousand asset of the Company.

     Commodity price sensitivity. The following tables provide information about
the Company's oil and gas derivative  financial  instruments that were sensitive
to  changes  in oil and gas  prices as of  December  31,  2003 and  2002.  As of
December  31,  2003  and  2002,  all of the  Company's  oil and  gas  derivative
financial instruments qualified as hedges.

     Commodity hedge  instruments.  The Company hedges commodity price risk with
swap and collar  contracts.  Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional
amount of sales volumes.  Collar contracts provide minimum ("floor") and maximum
("ceiling")  prices  for the  Company  on a  notional  amount of sales  volumes,
thereby  allowing some price  participation  if the relevant  index price closes
above the floor price.

     See Notes B, C and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
in "Item 8. Financial  Statements and  Supplementary  Data" for a description of
the accounting  procedures  followed by the Company relative to hedge derivative
financial  instruments and for specific  information  regarding the terms of the
Company's derivative financial  instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil
and gas prices.

Qualitative Disclosures

     Non-derivative financial instruments. The Company is a borrower under fixed
rate and variable  rate debt  instruments  that give rise to interest rate risk.
The  Company's  objective in borrowing  under fixed or variable  rate debt is to
satisfy capital  requirements  while  minimizing the Company's costs of capital.
See Note E of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in "Item 8.
Financial  Statements and Supplementary  Data" for a discussion of the Company's
debt instruments.

     Derivative  financial  instruments.  The Company  utilizes  interest  rate,
foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to hedge interest
rate,  foreign  exchange  rate and  commodity  price  risks in  accordance  with
policies  and  guidelines  approved  by the  Company's  board of  directors.  In
accordance  with  those  policies  and  guidelines,   the  Company's   executive
management determines the appropriate timing and extent of hedge transactions.

     As of December 31, 2003, the Company's  primary risk  exposures  associated
with  financial  instruments  to which it is a party  include  oil and gas price
volatility,  volatility  in the  exchange  rates  of  the  Canadian  dollar  and
Argentine  peso vis a vis the U.S.  dollar and  interest  rate  volatility.  The
Company's primary risk exposures associated with financial  instruments have not
changed significantly since December 31, 2003.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Pioneer Natural Resources Company:

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Pioneer
Natural  Resources Company (the "Company") as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and
the related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, cash
flows and comprehensive  income (loss) for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003. These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
the Company at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the  consolidated  results of its
operations  and its cash flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States.

     As discussed in Note B to the consolidated  financial  statements,  in 2003
the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 143,
"Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations".  Also, as discussed in Note B to
the consolidated financial statements,  in 2001 the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting  Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging Activities".

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


NOTE A.     Organization and Nature of Operations

     Pioneer  Natural  Resources  Company  (the  "Company"  or  "Pioneer")  is a
Delaware  corporation  whose  common  stock is listed and traded on the New York
Stock Exchange. The Company is an oil and gas exploration and production company
with ownership interests in oil and gas properties located in the United States,
Argentina, Canada, South Africa, Gabon and Tunisia.

NOTE B.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     Principles of consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include
the  accounts  of the  Company  and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  since their
acquisition or formation,  and the Company's  interest in the affiliated oil and
gas  partnerships  for which it serves as general partner through certain of its
wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  The Company proportionately  consolidates less than
100 percent-owned oil and gas partnerships in accordance with industry practice.
The Company owns less than a 20 percent interest in the oil and gas partnerships
that it proportionately  consolidates.  All material  intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

     Investments  in  unaffiliated   equity   securities  that  have  a  readily
determinable  fair value are classified as "trading  securities" if management's
current intent is to hold them for only a short period of time; otherwise,  they
are accounted for as  "available-for-sale"  securities.  The Company reevaluates
the  classification  of investments in  unaffiliated  equity  securities at each
balance   sheet   date.   The   carrying   value  of  trading   securities   and
available-for-sale  securities  are  adjusted  to fair value as of each  balance
sheet date.

     Unrealized  holding gains are recognized for trading securities in interest
and other revenue, and unrealized holding losses are recognized in other expense
during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.

     Unrealized  holding gains and losses are recognized for  available-for-sale
securities as credits or charges to stockholders' equity and other comprehensive
income (loss) during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.  Realized
gains  and  losses  on the  divestiture  of  available-for-sale  securities  are
determined  using the average cost  method.  The Company had no  investments  in
available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2003 or 2002.

     Investments in  unaffiliated  equity  securities that do not have a readily
determinable  fair value are measured at the lower of their original cost or the
net realizable  value of the investment.  The Company had no significant  equity
security  investments that did not have a readily  determinable fair value as of
December 31, 2003 or 2002.

     Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements. Preparation of
the accompanying  consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities,  the
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting  periods.  Depletion of oil and gas  properties  is  determined  using
estimates  of proved  oil and gas  reserves.  There are  numerous  uncertainties
inherent  in  the  estimation  of  quantities  of  proved  reserves  and  in the
projection  of  future  rates  of  production  and  the  timing  of  development
expenditures.  Similarly,  evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil
and gas  properties  are  subject to  numerous  uncertainties  including,  among
others,  estimates of future  recoverable  reserves;  commodity  price outlooks;
foreign laws,  restrictions  and currency  exchange rates; and export and excise
taxes.

     Argentina  devaluation.  Early in January 2002,  the  Argentine  government
severed the direct  one-to-one U.S. dollar to Argentine peso  relationship  that
had existed for many years.  As of December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the Company used
exchange  rates  of 2.93  pesos to $1 and 3.37  pesos  to $1,  respectively,  to
remeasure the  peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of the Company's






                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


Argentine subsidiaries.  The remeasurement of the peso-denominated  monetary net
assets of the Company's Argentine  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002
resulted in a charge of $.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively.

     As a result of certain  Argentine  stability laws and  regulations  enacted
since the  devaluation  of the Argentine peso which impact the price the Company
receives for the oil and gas it produces,  the Company has continually  reviewed
its Argentine  proved and unproved  properties  for  impairment  during 2003 and
2002.  Based on estimates of future  commodity  prices and operating  costs, the
Company  believes that the future cash flows from its oil and gas assets will be
sufficient to fully recover its proved property basis. The Company also plans to
continue its exploration efforts on all of its remaining unproved acreage. Based
upon the Company's  improved  economic  outlook for  Argentina,  the Company has
significantly  increased  its capital  budget for  exploration  and  development
activities in 2004 as compared to the capital budgets in 2003 and 2002.

     While the Argentine economic and political  situation continues to improve,
the Argentine  government may enact future  regulations  or policies that,  when
finalized  and  adopted,  may  materially  impact,  among other  items,  (i) the
realized prices the Company  receives for the commodities it produces and sells;
(ii) the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the Company's  corporate
headquarters in the United States;  (iii) the Company's asset  valuations;  (iv)
the Company's level of future investments in Argentina; and (v) peso-denominated
monetary  assets and  liabilities.  While  conditions  are  improving,  numerous
uncertainties exist surrounding the ultimate resolution of Argentina's  economic
and political stability and actual results could differ from those estimates and
assumptions utilized.

     New accounting pronouncements.  On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 143, "Accounting
for Asset Retirement  Obligations"  ("SFAS 143").  SFAS 143 amended Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 19, "Financial  Accounting and Reporting by
Oil and Gas Producing Companies" ("SFAS 19") to require that the fair value of a
liability  for an asset  retirement  obligation  be  recognized in the period in
which it is incurred if a reasonable  estimate of fair value can be made.  Under
the provisions of SFAS 143, asset  retirement  obligations  were  capitalized as
part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset. Under the provisions of SFAS
19,  asset  retirement  obligations  are  recognized  using a  cost-accumulation
approach.  Prior  to the  adoption  of SFAS  143,  the  Company  recorded  asset
retirement  obligations through the  unit-of-production  method, except for such
asset retirement obligations that were assumed in business  combinations,  which
were recorded at their estimated fair values.

     The  adoption of SFAS 143 resulted in a January 1, 2003  cumulative  effect
adjustment  to record (i) a $13.8  million  increase in the  carrying  values of
proved  properties,  (ii) a $26.3 million decrease in accumulated  depreciation,
depletion,  and  amortization  of property,  plant and  equipment,  (iii) a $1.0
million  increase  in  current  abandonment  liabilities,  (iv) a $22.4  million
increase in noncurrent  abandonment  liabilities and (v) a $1.3 million increase
in  Argentine  deferred  income  tax  liabilities.  The net  impact of items (i)
through (v) was to record a gain of $15.4  million,  net of tax, as a cumulative
effect  adjustment  of  a  change  in  accounting  principle  in  the  Company's
Consolidated Statements of Operations upon adoption on January 1, 2003.

     The  following pro forma data  summarizes  the Company's net income and net
income per share for the years ended December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001 as if the
Company  had adopted the  provisions  of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2001,  including
aggregate pro forma asset retirement obligations on that date of $60.2 million:







                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001



     On January 1, 2003,  the Company  adopted the  provisions  of  Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
and 64,  Amendment of FASB  Statement No. 13 and Technical  Corrections"  ("SFAS
145").  Prior to SFAS 145, gains or losses on the early  extinguishment  of debt
were required to be classified in a company's periodic  consolidated  statements
of operations as extraordinary  gains or losses, net of associated income taxes,
after the determination of income or loss from continuing  operations.  SFAS 145
requires,  except in the case of events or  transactions of a highly unusual and
infrequent nature, that gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt be
classified,  on both a prospective and  retrospective  basis, as components of a
company's  income  or loss  from  continuing  operations.  The  adoption  of the
provisions  of SFAS 145 did not  affect  the  Company's  financial  position  or
liquidity.  Under the  provisions  of SFAS 145,  gains or losses  from the early
extinguishment  of  debt  will  be  recognized  in  the  Company's  Consolidated
Statements of Operations as components of other income or other expense and will
be included in the determination of the income (loss) from continuing operations
of  those   periods.   Accordingly,   extraordinary   losses   from  the   early
extinguishment  of debt of $22.3  million and $3.8 million  recorded  during the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively,  have been reclassified to
other expense.

     During  January  2003,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued
Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"),
which requires the  consolidation  of certain entities that are determined to be
variable interest entities  ("VIE's").  An entity is considered to be a VIE when
either  (i) the  entity  lacks  sufficient  equity  to  carry  on its  principal
operations, (ii) the equity owners of the entity cannot make decisions about the
entity's  activities  or (iii) the entity's  equity  neither  absorbs  losses or
benefits from gains.

     The Company has reviewed its financial  arrangements and has not identified
any material VIEs that should be  consolidated by the Company in accordance with
FIN 46.

     Cash  equivalents.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  cash on hand and
depository accounts held by banks.

     Inventories  -  equipment.  Lease and well  equipment  to be used in future
production  and drilling  activities are carried at the lower of cost or market,
on a first-in,  first-out  basis.  The Company has established  lower of cost or
market allowances to reduce the carrying values of its equipment  inventories in
the amounts of $.6 million  and $3.6  million as of December  31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

     Inventories - commodities.  Commodities are carried at the lower of average
cost or market. When sold from inventory, commodities are removed on a first-in,
first-out basis.

     Oil and gas properties.  The Company utilizes the successful efforts method
of  accounting  for its oil and gas  properties.  Under this  method,  all costs
associated  with  productive  wells  and  nonproductive  development  wells  are

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological and geophysical
expenditures  are expensed.  The Company also expenses the costs associated with
exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves if a determination  that proved
reserves have been found cannot be made within one year of the exploration  well
being drilled unless other  drilling or  exploration  activities to evaluate the
discovery are firmly planned.  The Company capitalizes  interest on expenditures
for  significant  development  projects  until such projects are ready for their
intended use.

     The Company  owns  interests in 11 natural gas  processing  plants and five
treating  facilities.  The  Company  operates  seven of the  plants and all five
treating  facilities.  The  Company's  ownership  in the natural gas  processing
plants  and  treating  facilities  is  primarily  to  accommodate  handling  the
Company's gas  production and thus are considered a component of the capital and
operating costs of the respective  fields that they service.  To the extent that
there is excess capacity at a plant or treating  facility,  the Company attempts
to  process  third  party gas  volumes  for a fee to keep the plant or  treating
facility at capacity.  All  revenues  and expenses  derived from third party gas
volumes  processed  through the plants and treating  facilities  are reported as
components of oil and gas production  costs. The third party revenues  generated
from the plant and treating  facilities  for the three years ended  December 31,
2003,  2002 and 2001 were  $39.5  million,  $28.4  million  and  $32.7  million,
respectively.  The third party expenses  attributable to the plants and treating
facilities for the same respective periods were $11.3 million,  $9.3 million and
$9.7 million.  The capitalized  costs of the plants and treating  facilities are
included  in  proved  oil  and  gas   properties  and  are  depleted  using  the
unit-of-production  method along with the other  capitalized  costs of the field
that they service.

     Capitalized  costs  relating to proved  properties  are depleted  using the
unit-of-production  method  based  on  proved  reserves.  Costs  of  significant
nonproducing  properties,  wells in the process of being drilled and development
projects are excluded from depletion  until such time as the related  project is
completed and proved reserves are established or, if unsuccessful, impairment is
determined.

     Capitalized costs of individual properties sold or abandoned are charged to
accumulated depletion,  depreciation and amortization with the proceeds from the
sales of individual  properties  credited to property  costs. No gain or loss is
recognized until the entire amortization base is sold. However,  gain or loss is
recognized  from  the  sale of  less  than an  entire  amortization  base if the
disposition is significant enough to materially impact the depletion rate of the
remaining properties in the amortization base.

     The Company  reviews its long-lived  assets to be held and used,  including
proved oil and gas properties  accounted for under the successful efforts method
of accounting, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of those assets may not be  recoverable.  An impairment loss is indicated if the
sum of the expected  future cash flows is less than the  carrying  amount of the
assets. In this circumstance,  the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the
amount by which the  carrying  amount of the asset  exceeds the  estimated  fair
value of the asset.

     Unproved  oil and gas  properties  that are  individually  significant  are
periodically  assessed for impairment by comparing their cost to their estimated
value on a  project-by-project  basis.  The  estimated  value is affected by the
results of exploration  activities,  commodity  price  outlooks,  planned future
sales or  expiration  of all or a portion of such  projects.  If the quantity of
potential  reserves  determined by such  evaluations  is not sufficient to fully
recover  the cost  invested  in each  project,  the Company  will  recognize  an
impairment loss at that time by recording an allowance.  The remaining  unproved
oil and gas  properties,  if  any,  are  aggregated  and an  overall  impairment
allowance is provided based on the Company's historical experience.

     Treasury  stock.  Treasury  stock  purchases  are  recorded  at cost.  Upon
reissuance,  the cost of treasury shares held is reduced by the average purchase
price per share of the aggregate treasury shares held.

     Environmental.  The Company's  environmental  expenditures  are expensed or
capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate
to an  existing  condition  caused by  past  operations and  that have no future

economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend the life of the related
property  or  mitigate  or  prevent  future   environmental   contamination  are
capitalized.  Liabilities  are recorded  when  environmental  assessment  and/or
remediation  is  probable  and  the  costs  can be  reasonably  estimated.  Such
liabilities  are  undiscounted  unless  the  timing  of  cash  payments  for the
liability are fixed or reliably determinable.

     Revenue recognition. The Company uses the entitlements method of accounting
for oil,  NGL and gas  revenues.  Sales  proceeds  in  excess  of the  Company's
entitlement  are included in other  liabilities and the Company's share of sales
taken by others is included  in other  assets in the  accompanying  Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  The following table presents the Company's  entitlement  assets
and entitlement liabilities and their associated volumes as of December 31, 2003
and 2002 ($ in millions):


     Derivatives and hedging. In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  "Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133") as amended, the
provisions of which the Company adopted effective January 1, 2001.

     SFAS 133 requires the accounting  recognition of all derivative instruments
as either assets or liabilities at fair value.  Derivative  instruments that are
not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net income  (loss).  Under the
provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that
are fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged
assets,  liabilities,  or firm commitments through net income (loss).  Effective
changes in the fair value of  derivative  instruments  that are cash flow hedges
are recognized in "accumulated other comprehensive  income (loss) ("AOCI") - net
deferred hedge gains (losses),  net of tax" in the stockholders'  equity section
of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets until such time as the hedged items
are  recognized  in net income  (loss).  Ineffective  portions  of a  derivative
instrument's  change in fair  value are  immediately  recognized  in net  income
(loss).

     The  adoption  of  SFAS  133  resulted  in a  January  1,  2001  transition
adjustment  to (i)  reclassify  $57.8  million of deferred  losses on terminated
hedge  positions  from other assets  (including  $11.6  million of other current
assets),  (ii)  increase  other current  assets,  other assets and other current
liabilities by $7.0 million, $6.2 million and $146.6 million,  respectively,  to
record the fair value of open hedge  derivatives,  (iii)  increase  the carrying
value of hedged  long-term  debt by $6.2  million and (iv) reduce  stockholders'
equity by $197.4  million for the net impact of items (i) through  (iii)  above.
The  $197.4  million  reduction  in  stockholders'  equity  was  reflected  as a
transition adjustment in other comprehensive income (loss) on January 1, 2001.

     Under the  provisions  of SFAS 133, the Company may  designate a derivative
instrument as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a
liability or an identified  portion thereof that is attributable to a particular
risk (a "fair  value  hedge") or as  hedging  the  exposure  to  variability  in
expected  future cash flows that are  attributable to a particular risk (a "cash
flow hedge").  Both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing  basis, a fair
value hedge must be  expected to be highly  effective  in  achieving  offsetting
changes in fair value  attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a
hedge is designated.  Similarly, a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly
effective in achieving  offsetting  cash flows  attributable  to the hedged risk
during the term of the hedge.  The  expectation of hedge  effectiveness  must be
supported  by matching the  essential  terms of the hedged  asset,  liability or
forecasted  transaction  to the derivative  hedge  contract or by  effectiveness
assessments  using statistical  measurements.  The Company's policy is to assess
actual hedge effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter.

     See  Note  J  for  a  description  of  the  specific  types  of  derivative
transactions in which the Company participates.

     Stock-based  compensation.  The Company has a long-term incentive plan (the
"Long-Term   Incentive  Plan")  under  which  the  Company  grants   stock-based
compensation.  The Long-Term  Incentive  Plan is described more fully in Note G.
The Company  accounts for stock-based  compensation  granted under the Long-Term
Incentive  Plan  using the  intrinsic  value  method  prescribed  by  Accounting
Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees"
("APB  25")  and  related  interpretations.  Stock-based  compensation  expenses
associated  with option  grants were not  recognized in the Company's net income
during the years ended December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001, as all options granted
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan had exercise prices equal to the market value
of the underlying common stock on the dates of grant.  Stock-based  compensation
expense  associated  with  restricted  stock awards is deferred and amortized to
earnings  ratably over the vesting  periods of the awards.  The following  table
illustrates  the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share as if the
Company  had applied  the fair value  recognition  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.  123,   "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
Compensation"  to stock-based  compensation  during the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001:


     Foreign currency  translation.  The U.S. dollar is the functional  currency
for all of the Company's  international  operations except Canada.  Accordingly,
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured
to U.S.  dollars  at the  exchange  rate in effect at the end of each  reporting
period;  revenues and costs and expenses  denominated in a foreign  currency are
remeasured  at the average of the exchange  rates that were in effect during the
period  in which  the  revenues  and costs and  expenses  were  recognized.  The
resulting gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency denominated balances
into U.S.  dollars are recorded in other income or other expense,  respectively.
Nonmonetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in a  foreign  currency  are
remeasured at the historic exchange rates that were in effect when the assets or
liabilities were acquired or incurred.

     The  functional  currency  of  the  Company's  Canadian  operations  is the
Canadian dollar. The financial  statements of the Company's Canadian  subsidiary
entities are translated to U.S.  dollars as follows:  all assets and liabilities
are  translated  using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each  reporting
period;  revenues and costs and expenses are translated using the average of the
exchange  rates that were in effect  during the period in which the revenues and
costs  and  expenses  were  recognized.  The  resulting  gains  or  losses  from
translating   non-U.S.   dollar   denominated   balances  are  recorded  in  the
accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Stockholders'  Equity for the period
through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

     The  following  table  presents  the exchange  rates used to translate  the
financial  statements of the Company's Canadian subsidiary in the preparation of
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001:


     Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2002 and
2001 amounts in order to conform with the 2003 presentation.

NOTE C.     Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values
of the Company's financial instruments as of December 31, 2003 and 2002:


     Cash and cash  equivalents,  accounts  receivable,  other  current  assets,
accounts payable,  interest payable and other current liabilities.  The carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.







                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


     Commodity price swap and collar contracts,  interest rate swaps and foreign
currency  swap  contracts.  The fair  value of  commodity  price swap and collar
contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are estimated from
quotes  provided  by  the  counterparties  to  these  derivative  contracts  and
represent the estimated  amounts that the Company would expect to receive or pay
to settle the derivative contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company  terminated  all of its  interest  rate swap  contracts  and the foreign
currency  contracts  matured.  See  Note J for a  description  of each of  these
derivatives,  including  whether the  derivative  contract  qualifies  for hedge
accounting treatment or is considered a speculative derivative contract.

     Financial assets. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had an investment in
bonds that were  classified as trading  securities  and a note  receivable.  The
Company  divested the bonds  during  January  2003.  The fair value of the 5-1/2
percent note  receivable  was  determined  based on  underlying  market rates of
interest.

     Long-term  debt. The carrying  amount of borrowings  outstanding  under the
Company's  corporate  credit  facility  approximates  fair value  because  these
instruments  bear interest at variable market rates.  The fair values of each of
the senior note issuances were determined based on quoted market prices for each
of the issues.  See Note E for  additional  information  regarding the Company's
long-term debt.

NOTE D.     Acquisitions

     Falcon  acquisitions.  During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
purchased,  through two transactions,  an additional 30 percent working interest
in the Falcon field  development and a 25 percent working interest in associated
acreage in the deepwater  Gulf of Mexico for a combined  purchase price of $61.1
million.  As a result of these  transactions,  the  Company  owned a 75  percent
working  interest  in and  operated  the Falcon  field  development  and related
exploration  blocks at  December  31,  2002.  On March  28,  2003,  the  Company
purchased the remaining 25 percent working  interest that it did not already own
in the Falcon field,  the Harrier field and surrounding  satellite  prospects in
the deepwater  Gulf of Mexico for $120.4  million,  including  $114.1 million of
cash, $1.7 million of asset retirement  obligations  assumed and $4.6 million of
closing adjustments.

     West Panhandle  acquisitions.  During July 2002, the Company  completed the
purchase  of the  remaining  23 percent of the rights  that the  Company did not
already own in its core area West  Panhandle gas field,  100 percent of the West
Panhandle  reserves  attributable to field fuel, 100 percent of the related West
Panhandle  field  gathering  system and ten  blocks  surrounding  the  Company's
deepwater   Gulf  of  Mexico  Falcon   discovery.   In  connection   with  these
transactions,  the  Company  recorded  $100.4  million  to  proved  oil  and gas
properties,  $3.8 million to unproved oil and gas properties and $1.9 million to
assets held for resale;  retired a capital cost  obligation  for $60.8  million;
settled  a  $20.9   million  gas   balancing   receivable;   assumed  trade  and
environmental  obligations amounting to $5.8 million in the aggregate;  and paid
$140.2 million of cash. The capital cost  obligation  retired by the Company for
$60.8 million  represented  an obligation  for West  Panhandle gas field capital
additions that was not able to be prepaid and bore interest at an annual rate of
20 percent. The portion of the purchase price allocated to the retirement of the
capital cost  obligation  was based on a discounted  cash flow analysis  using a
market  discount  rate for  obligations  with  similar  terms.  The capital cost
obligation had a carrying  value of $45.2 million,  resulting in a loss of $15.6
million from the early extinguishment of this obligation.

     Affiliated partnership mergers.  During 2001, the limited partners of 42 of
the Company's affiliated  partnerships  approved an agreement and plan of merger
("Plan of Merger")  among the  Company,  Pioneer  Natural  Resources  USA,  Inc.
("Pioneer USA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the partnerships.
The Plan of Merger was  accounted  for as a purchase  business  combination.  In
consideration for the  partnerships'  net assets,  the limited partners received
5.7 million shares of the Company's  common stock valued at $18.35 per share. In
connection with this  transaction,  the Company recorded $92.9 million to proved
oil and gas  properties,  $13.6  million  to cash and $.3  million  to other net
assets.  The cash  acquired from the  partnerships,  net of $2.5 million of cash
transaction costs,  is included in  "cash acquired in acquisitions,  net of fees

paid" in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statement  of Cash  Flows for the year
ended  December  31,  2001.  Except  for the  cash  acquired,  this  transaction
represents  a noncash  investing  activity of the Company that was funded by the
issuance of common stock.

     Other acquisitions.  During 2003, in addition to the incremental 25 percent
working interest acquired in the Falcon area, the Company spent $30.6 million to
acquire producing  properties in the Spraberry field and unproved  properties in
Alaska,  the Gulf of Mexico,  Argentina,  Canada and Tunisia.  During  2002,  in
addition to the Falcon and West Panhandle  acquisitions  referred to above,  the
Company spent $25.5 million to acquire additional unproved acreage in the United
States,  including 34 Gulf of Mexico shelf blocks,  six deepwater Gulf of Mexico
blocks,  a 70 percent  working  interest in ten state  leases on Alaska's  North
Slope and property  interests in other areas of the United  States.  Also during
2002, the Company acquired unproved and proved oil and gas property interests in
Canada for $2.3  million  and $.5  million,  respectively,  and $1.8  million of
additional  unproved  property  interests in Tunisia.  During 2001,  the Company
spent  $77.9  million to acquire  additional  working  interests  in the Gulf of
Mexico Aconcagua discovery,  the related Canyon Express gathering system and the
Devils Tower project;  21 deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks;  250,000 acres in the
Anticlinal Campamento,  Dos Hermanas and La Calera areas of the Neuquen Basin in
Argentina; and a 30 percent interest in the Anaguid permit in the Ghadames basin
onshore Southern Tunisia.

NOTE E.     Long-term Debt

     Long-term  debt,  including the effects of fair value hedges and discounts,
consisted of the following  components  at December 31, 2003 and 2002:


     Maturities  of  long-term  debt at  December  31,  2003 are as follows  (in
thousands):


     Lines of credit.  During  December  2003,  the Company  entered  into a new
five-year  unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "New Credit Facility") that
matures in December  2008. The New Credit  Facility  replaced the Company's $575
million  revolving  credit  facility  (the "Prior Credit  Facility")  that had a
scheduled  maturity in March 2005. The terms of the New Credit Facility  provide
for initial  aggregate  loan  commitments  of $700 million from a syndication of
participating  banks (the "Lenders").  Aggregate loan commitments  under the New
Credit Facility may be increased to a maximum  aggregate amount of $1 billion if
the Lenders increase their loan commitments or loan commitments of new financial
institutions are added to the New Credit Facility.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001



     Borrowings  under the New Credit  Facility  may be in the form of revolving
loans or swing line loans. Aggregate outstanding swing line loans may not exceed
$80 million. Revolving loans issued under the New Credit Facility bear interest,
at the option of the Company,  based on (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher
of the prime  rate  announced  from  time to time by  JPMorgan  Chase  Bank (4.0
percent per annum at December 31, 2003) or the weighted  average of the rates on
overnight Federal funds  transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System
during the last  preceding  business  day plus 50 basis  point (1.5  percent per
annum at December 31, 2003) or (b) a base Eurodollar rate,  substantially  equal
to LIBOR (1.2  percent  per annum at  December  31,  2003),  plus a margin  (the
"Applicable  Margin") that is based on a grid of the Company's  debt rating (125
basis points per annum at December 31, 2003).  Swing line loans bear interest at
a rate  per  annum  equal  to the  "ASK"  rate for  Federal  funds  periodically
published by the Dow Jones Market Service.  As of December 31, 2003, the Company
had $160 million of Eurodollar  rate revolving loans  outstanding  under the New
Credit Facility.

     Advances under the Prior Credit  Facility bore  interest,  at the option of
the  Company,  based  on (a) a base  rate  equal  to the  higher  of the Bank of
America,  N.A.  prime rate or a rate per annum based on the weighted  average of
the rates on overnight  Federal funds  transactions  with members of the Federal
Reserve System,  plus 50 basis points;  plus a eurodollar  margin less 125 basis
points, (b) a Eurodollar rate,  substantially  equal to LIBOR, plus a eurodollar
margin,  or (c) a fixed rate (for aggregate  advances not exceeding $50 million)
as quoted by the banks pursuant to a request by the Company.

     The New  Credit  Facility  imposes  certain  restrictive  covenants  on the
Company,  including the maintenance of a ratio of the Company's  earnings before
gain or loss on the  disposition  of assets,  interest  expense,  income  taxes,
depreciation,  depletion and amortization expense,  exploration and abandonments
expense and other noncash charges and expenses to consolidated  interest expense
of at  least  3.5  to  1.0;  maintenance  of a  ratio  of  total  debt  to  book
capitalization  less  intangible  assets  (other  than  intangible  oil  and gas
assets),  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income and  certain  noncash  asset
write-downs not to exceed .60 to 1.0; and, maintenance of an annual ratio of the
net present value of the  Company's  oil and gas  properties to total debt of at
least 1.25 to 1.00 until the Company has an investment grade rating. The Company
was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of December 31, 2003.

     As of December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the Company had $47.6  million and $45.4
million of undrawn  letters of credit,  respectively,  of which $28.8 million on
December  31,  2003  and  $27.2  million  on  December  31,  2002  were  undrawn
commitments   under  the  New  Credit   Facility  and  Prior  Credit   Facility,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had unused borrowing
capacity of $511.2 million and $287.8 million under the New Credit  Facility and
Prior Credit Facility, respectively.

     Senior notes. The Company's senior notes are general unsecured  obligations
ranking equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness
of the  Company  and are senior in right of payment to all  existing  and future
subordinated  indebtedness of the Company. The Company is a holding company that
conducts all of its operations through  subsidiaries;  consequently,  the senior
notes are  structurally  subordinated  to all  obligations of its  subsidiaries.
Interest on the Company's senior notes is payable semi-annually. Pioneer USA has
fully and unconditionally guaranteed the senior note issuances. See Note S for a
discussion  of  Pioneer  USA  debt   guarantees  and   Consolidating   Financial
Statements.

     During  April 2002,  the Company  issued  $150.0  million of 7-1/2  percent
senior notes due April 15, 2012 (the "7-1/2  percent senior  notes").  The 7-1/2
percent  senior  notes  were  issued at a price  equal to 100  percent  of their
principal amount and resulted in net proceeds to the Company, after underwriting
discounts,  commissions  and  costs of  issuance,  of  $146.7  million.  The net
proceeds from the issuance of the 7-1/2 percent senior notes were used to reduce
outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility. The 7-1/2 percent senior
notes and 9-5/8 percent  senior notes  contain  various  restrictive  covenants,
including restrictions on the incurrence of additional  indebtedness and certain

payments defined within the associated indenture.  The Company was in compliance
with all of its senior note covenants as of December 31, 2003.

     As of  December  31, 2003 and 2002,  the  aggregate  carrying  value of the
Company's  8-7/8,  8-1/4,  6-1/2 and 9-5/8 percent  senior notes  included $27.4
million  and  $35.7  million,   respectively,   of  incremental  carrying  value
attributable   to  the  unamortized  net  deferred  hedge  gains  realized  from
terminated  fair  value  hedge  interest  rate  swap  contracts.  See Note J for
additional  information regarding terminated fair value hedge interest rate swap
contracts.

     Early extinguishment of debt and capital cost obligation.  During 2003, the
Company  repurchased  $5.1 million of its 8-7/8 percent  senior notes and repaid
the  Prior  Credit  Facility  prior  to  its  scheduled  maturity.  The  Company
recognized  $1.5  million  of  charges  to  other  expense  associated  with the
aforementioned debt extinguishments.

     During 2002,  the Company  repurchased  $47.1  million of the 9-5/8 percent
senior notes, $13.9 million of the 8-7/8 percent senior notes and repaid a $45.2
million  capital  cost  obligation.  The  Company  recognized  a charge to other
expense of $22.3 million associated with these debt extinguishments.

     During 2001,  the Company  redeemed the  remaining  $22.5 million of 11-5/8
percent  senior  subordinated  discount notes and $6.8 million of 10-5/8 percent
senior subordinated notes.  Additionally,  the Company repurchased $38.7 million
of the 9-5/8 percent senior notes.  Associated with these debt  extinguishments,
the Company recognized a charge to other expense of $3.8 million.

     See Note B for a discussion  of the  classification  of gains and losses on
the early  extinguishment  of debt after the  adoption of SFAS 145 on January 1,

NOTE G.     Incentive Plans

Retirement Plans

     Deferred  compensation  retirement  plan. In August 1997, the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors approved a deferred compensation  retirement
plan for the officers and certain key employees of the Company. Each officer and
key employee is allowed to  contribute up to 25 percent of their base salary and
100  percent  of their  annual  bonus.  The  Company  will  provide  a  matching
contribution  of 100 percent of the  officer's and key  employee's  contribution
limited to the first 10 percent of the  officer's  base salary and eight percent
of the key employee's base salary.  The Company's  matching  contribution  vests
immediately.  A trust fund has been established by the Company to accumulate the
contributions   made  under  this  retirement   plan.  The  Company's   matching
contributions were $851 thousand,  $805 thousand and $652 thousand for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     401(k) plan. The Pioneer  Natural  Resources USA, Inc.  401(k) and Matching
Plan (the "401(k) Plan") is a defined  contribution  plan established  under the
Internal  Revenue  Code Section 401. The 401(k) Plan was formed by the merger of
the Pioneer  Natural  Resources  USA, Inc.  401(k) Plan and the Pioneer  Natural
Resources USA, Inc.  Matching Plan on January 1, 2002. All regular full-time and
part-time  employees  of Pioneer USA are eligible to  participate  in the 401(k)
Plan on the first day of the month  following  their date of hire.  Participants
may  contribute  an amount of not less than two percent nor more than 30 percent
of their annual salary into the 401(k) Plan. Matching  contributions are made to
the 401(k)  Plan in cash by Pioneer  USA in  amounts  equal to 200  percent of a
participant's  contributions  to the 401(k)  Plan that are not in excess of five
percent of the participant's  basic compensation (the "Matching  Contribution").
Each  participant's  account is credited with the  participant's  contributions,
their Matching  Contributions  and  allocations  of the 401(k) Plan's  earnings.
Participants  are fully  vested in their  account  balances  except for Matching
Contributions and their proportionate share of 401(k) Plan earnings attributable
to Matching  Contributions,  which  proportionately vest over a four year period
that begins with the participant's date of hire. During the years ended December
31, 2003,  2002 and 2001, the Company  recognized  compensation  expense of $4.5
million,  $4.1 million and $3.4 million,  respectively,  as a result of Matching
Contributions.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

     In August 1997, the Company's  stockholders  approved a Long-Term Incentive
Plan which  provides for the  granting of incentive  awards in the form of stock
options,  stock appreciation  rights,  performance units and restricted stock to
directors,  officers and employees of the Company.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan
provides for the issuance of a maximum number of shares of common stock equal to
10 percent of the total number of shares of common stock equivalents outstanding
less the total number of shares of common stock  subject to  outstanding  awards
under any stock-  based plan for the  directors,  officers or  employees  of the
Company.

                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


     The following  table  calculates the number of shares or options  available
for grant under the Company's  Long- Term Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2003
and 2002:


     Stock  option  awards.  The Company  has a program of awarding  semi-annual
stock options to its officers and employees and gives its non-employee directors
a choice to receive (i) 100 percent  restricted  stock,  (ii) 100 percent  stock
options,  (iii) 100 percent cash, or (iv) a combination  of 50/50 of any two, as
their annual  compensation.  This program provides for stock option awards at an
exercise price based upon the closing sales price of the Company's  common stock
on the day prior to the date of grant. Employee stock option awards vest over an
18 month or three year  schedule  and provide a five year  exercise  period from
each vesting date.  Non-employee  directors'  stock  options vest  quarterly and
provide for a five year  exercise  period from each  vesting  date.  The Company
granted 1,353,988, 1,643,212 and 1,627,071 options under the Long-Term Incentive
Plan during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     Restricted  stock  awards.  During the year ended  December 31,  2003,  the
Company  issued  77,625  restricted  shares of the Company's  common stock.  The
restricted  share awards were issued as compensation to directors,  officers and
key employees of the Company.  The restricted share awards included 4,425 shares
that were granted to directors of the Company on May 14, 2003.  Director  awards
vest on a  quarterly  prorata  basis  during  the year ended May 14,  2004.  The
remaining 73,200 restricted shares were awarded to officers and key employees of
the Company.  Of the shares  awarded,  9,500 shares vest on January 26, 2006 and
the remaining 63,700 shares vest on September 30, 2006.

     During the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  the  Company  issued  654,445
restricted  shares of the Company's  common stock.  The restricted  share awards
were issued as  compensation  to  directors,  officers and key  employees of the
Company. The restricted share awards included 18,545 shares that were granted to
directors  of the  Company on May 13,  2002.  Director  awards for 3,302  shares
vested on a  quarterly  prorata  basis  during the year  ended May 13,  2003 and
director  awards for 15,243 shares vest on May 13, 2005.  The remaining  635,900
restricted  shares were awarded to officers and key  employees of the Company on
August 12, 2002 and vest on August 12, 2005.

     The  Company   recorded   $1.1  million  and  $16.2   million  of  deferred
compensation associated with restricted stock awards in the stockholders' equity
section of the accompanying  Consolidated  Balance Sheets during the years ended
December  31, 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  Such  amounts  will be amortized to
compensation  expense over the vesting  periods of the awards.  During the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,  amortization  of the restricted  stock awards
increased the Company's  compensation  expense by $5.4 million and $1.9 million,
respectively.

                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


     The following  table reflects the outstanding  restricted  stock awards and
activity related thereto for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002:


     There were no restricted  stock awards to directors or employees during the
year ended December 31, 2001.

     Other stock based plans. Prior to the formation of the Company in 1997, the
Company's  predecessor  companies  had long-term  incentive  plans in place that
allowed the  predecessor  companies  to grant  incentive  awards  similar to the
provisions of the Long-Term  Incentive Plan. Upon formation of the Company,  all
awards under these plans were assumed by the Company with the provision  that no
additional awards be granted under the predecessor plans.

     SFAS  123   disclosures.   The   Company   applies   APB  25  and   related
interpretations  in  accounting  for its stock option  awards.  Accordingly,  no
compensation  expense  has been  recognized  for its  stock  option  awards.  If
compensation expense for the stock option awards had been determined  consistent
with SFAS 123, the Company's net income and net income per share would have been
less than the reported  amounts.  See Note B for a comparison  of net income and
net income per share as reported  and as adjusted  for the pro forma  effects of
determining compensation expense in accordance with SFAS 123.

     Under SFAS 123,  the fair value of each stock  option grant is estimated on
the date of grant  using  the  Black-  Scholes  option  pricing  model  with the
following  weighted  average  assumptions used for grants during the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:

and 2001, and changes during the years then ended, are presented below:


     The  following  table  summarizes  information  about the  Company's  stock
options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2003:


Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     The Company has an Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan (the "ESPP") that allows
eligible  employees  to  annually  purchase  the  Company's  common  stock  at a
discounted price. Officers of the Company are not eligible to participate in the
ESPP.  Contributions  to the ESPP are limited to 15 percent of an employee's pay
(subject  to  certain  ESPP  limits)  during  the nine  month  offering  period.
Participants in the ESPP purchase the Company's  common stock at a price that is
15 percent below the closing sales price of the Company's common stock on either
the first day or the last day of each offering period,  whichever  closing sales
price is lower.

Postretirement Benefit Obligations

     As of December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the Company had recorded  $15.6  million
and $19.7 million,  respectively, of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations in the Company's  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance Sheets.  These
obligations  are  comprised  of five plans of which four  relate to  predecessor
entities that the Company acquired in prior years.  These plans had no assets as
of December 31, 2003 or 2002.  Other than the  Company's  retirement  plan,  the
participants of these plans are not current employees of the Company.

                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


     The  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligations  pertaining to these
plans were determined by independent actuaries for four plans representing $11.2
million  of  unfunded  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligations  as  of
December 31, 2003 and by the Company for one plan  representing  $4.4 million of
unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2003.
Interest  costs at an annual  rate of six percent of the  periodic  undiscounted
accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligations were employed in the valuations
of the benefit  obligations.  Certain of the  aforementioned  plans  provide for
medical and dental cost  subsidies for plan  participants.  Annual  medical cost
escalation  trends of 12 percent in 2004,  declining to five percent in 2011 and
thereafter,  and annual  dental cost  escalation  trends of 7.5 percent in 2004,
declining to five percent in 2009 and thereafter,  were employed to estimate the
accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligations associated with the medical and
dental cost subsidies.

     The  following  table   reconciles   changes  in  the  Company's   unfunded
accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligations during the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002:


     Estimated  benefit payments and service costs associated with the plans for
the year ended December 31, 2004 are $1.4 million and $.3 million, respectively.

NOTE H.     Issuance of Common Stock

     During April 2002, the Company  completed a public offering of 11.5 million
shares of its  common  stock at $21.50  per  share.  Associated  therewith,  the
Company  received  $236.0  million of net proceeds after the payment of issuance
costs.  The Company used the net proceeds  from the public  offering to fund the
2002  acquisition of Falcon assets and associated  acreage in the deepwater Gulf
of  Mexico  and the  West  Panhandle  gas  field  acquisitions.  See  Note D for
information regarding these acquisitions.

NOTE I.     Commitments and Contingencies

     Severance  agreements.  The Company has entered into  severance  agreements
with its  officers,  subsidiary  company  officers  and certain  key  employees.
Salaries and bonuses for the Company's  officers are set by the Company's  board
of directors for the parent  company  officers and by the  Company's  management
committee for subsidiary company officers and key employees. The Company's board
of directors and management  committee can grant increases or reductions to base
salary at their  discretion.  The current annual salaries for the parent company
officers,  the subsidiary  company officers and key employees covered under such
agreements total approximately $19.9 million.

     Indemnifications.  The Company has indemnified its directors and certain of
its officers,  employees  and agents with respect to claims and damages  arising
from  acts or  omissions  taken in such  capacity,  as well as with  respect  to
certain litigation.

     Legal actions.  The Company is party to various legal actions incidental to
its business,  including,  but not limited to, the proceedings  described below.
The majority of these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising from
oil and gas leases and ownership  interest  disputes.  The Company believes that
the ultimate disposition of these legal actions will not have a material adverse

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

effect on the Company's  consolidated  financial  position,  liquidity,  capital
resources or future results of operations. The Company will continue to evaluate
its  litigation  matters  on a  quarter-by-  quarter  basis and will  adjust its
litigation  reserves  as  appropriate  to  reflect  the then  current  status of
litigation.

     Alford.  The Company is party to a 1993 class action  lawsuit  filed in the
26th Judicial District Court of Stevens County, Kansas by two classes of royalty
owners,  one for  each  of the  Company's  gathering  systems  connected  to the
Company's Satanta gas plant. The case was relatively inactive for several years.
In early 2000,  the plaintiffs  amended their  pleadings and it now contains two
material claims.  First, the plaintiffs assert that they were improperly charged
expenses  (primarily field compression),  which are a "cost of production",  and
for which the plaintiffs,  as royalty owners,  are not responsible.  Second, the
plaintiffs  claim they are  entitled  to 100  percent of the value of the helium
extracted at the Company's  Satanta gas plant. If the plaintiffs were to prevail
on the above two claims in their  entirety,  it is possible  that the  Company's
liability  (both  for  periods  covered  by the  lawsuit  and from the last date
covered by the lawsuit to the present - because  the  deductions  continue to be
taken and the plaintiffs  continue to be paid for a royalty share of the helium)
could reach $65.0  million,  plus  prejudgment  interest.  However,  the Company
believes  it has  valid  defenses  to  the  plaintiffs'  claims,  has  paid  the
plaintiffs  properly  under  their  respective  oil and  gas  leases  and  other
agreements, and intends to vigorously defend itself.

     The  Company  does not  believe  the costs it has  deducted  are a "cost of
production".  The costs being  deducted are post  production  costs  incurred to
transport the gas to the Company's  Satanta gas plant for processing,  where the
valuable  hydrocarbon  liquids  and  helium  are  extracted  from the  gas.  The
plaintiffs  benefit from such extractions and the Company believes that charging
the  plaintiffs  with  their  proportionate  share  of such  transportation  and
processing  expenses  is  consistent  with  Kansas  law and  with  the  parties'
agreements.

     The Company has also vigorously  defended against plaintiffs' claims to 100
percent of the value of the helium  extracted,  and believes  that in accordance
with  applicable  law, it has  properly  accounted to the  plaintiffs  for their
fractional  royalty share of the helium under the specified  royalty  clauses of
the respective oil and gas leases.

     The  factual  evidence  in the case  was  presented  to the  26th  Judicial
District Court without a jury in December 2001. Oral arguments were heard by the
court in April 2002,  and  although  the court has not yet entered a judgment or
findings,  it could do so at any time. The Company strongly denies the existence
of any material  underpayment to the plaintiffs and believes it presented strong
evidence at trial to support its positions. Although the amount of any resulting
liability  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  results of
operations  for the  quarterly  reporting  period  in which  such  liability  is
recorded,  the  Company  does not  expect  that any such  liability  will have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated  financial position as a whole or on
its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations.

     Kansas ad valorem tax. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ("NGPA") allows a
"severance,  production  or similar"  tax to be included as an add-on,  over and
above the maximum  lawful price for gas.  Based on a Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") ruling that Kansas ad valorem tax was such a tax, one of the
Company's  predecessor  entities collected the Kansas ad valorem tax in addition
to the otherwise  maximum  lawful  price.  The FERC's ruling was appealed to the
United  States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  ("D.C.  Circuit"),
which held in June 1988 that the FERC failed to provide a  reasonable  basis for
its findings and remanded the case to the FERC for further consideration.

     On December 1, 1993,  the FERC issued an order  reversing its prior ruling,
but limited the effect of its decision to Kansas ad valorem taxes for sales made
on or after June 28, 1988. The FERC clarified the effective date of its decision
by an order dated May 18, 1994.  The order  clarified  that the  effective  date
applies to tax bills  rendered  after June 28, 1988,  not sales made on or after
that date.  Numerous  parties  filed  appeals  on the FERC's  action in the D.C.
Circuit.  Various gas producers challenged the FERC's orders on two grounds: (1)
that  the   Kansas  ad  valorem  tax,  properly  understood,  does  qualify  for






                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


reimbursement  under the NGPA; and (2) the FERC's ruling  should,  in any event,
have been applied  prospectively.  Other parties challenged the FERC's orders on
the grounds that the FERC's  ruling  should have been applied  retroactively  to
December 1, 1978,  the date of the  enactment of the NGPA and  producers  should
have been required to pay refunds accordingly.

     The D.C.  Circuit  issued its decision on August 2, 1996,  which holds that
producers  must make refunds of all Kansas ad valorem tax collected with respect
to production since October 4, 1983, as opposed to June 28, 1988.  Petitions for
rehearing  were denied on November 6, 1996.  Various gas producers  subsequently
filed a petition  for writ of  certiori  with the United  States  Supreme  Court
seeking to limit the scope of the potential  refunds to tax bills rendered on or
after  June 28,  1988 (the  effective  date  originally  selected  by the FERC).
Williams  Natural Gas Company  filed a  cross-petition  for certiori  seeking to
impose refund  liability back to December 1, 1978. Both petitions were denied on
May 12, 1997.

     The Company and other  producers  filed  petitions for adjustment  with the
FERC on June 24, 1997. The Company was seeking a waiver or set-off from the FERC
with respect to that  portion of the refund  associated  with (i)  nonrecoupable
royalties,  (ii)  nonrecoupable  Kansas  property taxes based, in part, upon the
higher  prices  collected and (iii)  interest for all periods.  On September 10,
1997,  FERC denied this request,  and on October 10, 1997, the Company and other
producers filed a request for rehearing. Pipelines were given until November 10,
1997 to file claims on refunds sought from producers and refund claims  totaling
approximately $30.2 million were made against the Company.  Through December 31,
2003, the Company has settled $21.6 million of the original claim amounts. As of
December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the Company had on deposit  $10.7 million and $10.6
million, respectively,  including accrued interest, in an escrow account and had
corresponding  obligations  for the  remaining  claim  recorded in other current
liabilities in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  On December 1,
2003, an administrative  law judge issued a Partial Initial Decision denying the
Company's  request to allow any waiver or set-off  from the  refunds and stating
that the Company must pay the FERC interest rate on the refund claims instead of
the escrow  interest  rate.  The Company has accrued an additional  $1.5 million
obligation  for the  difference  between the escrow  interest  rate and the FERC
interest rate,  although the Company intends to vigorously  appeal the decision.
The Company believes that the accrued  obligations will be sufficient to resolve
the remaining claims.

     Lease  agreements.  The  Company  leases  offshore  production  facilities,
equipment and office facilities under  noncancellable  operating leases.  Rental
expenses associated with these operating leases for the years ended December 31,
2003,  2002 and 2001 were  approximately  $15.5  million,  $6.7 million and $6.6
million,  respectively.  Future minimum lease commitments  under  noncancellable
operating leases at December 31, 2003 are as follows (in thousands):


     Drilling  commitments.  The Company  periodically  enters into  contractual
arrangements under which the Company is committed to expend funds to drill wells
in the future.  The Company also enters into  agreements to secure  drilling rig
services  which require the Company to make future  minimum  payments to the rig
operators. The Company records drilling commitments in the periods in which well
capital is expended or rig services are provided.

     Transportation  agreements.  The Company's wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary
is a party to pipeline  transportation service agreements,  with remaining terms
of  approximately  12 years,  whereby it has  committed to transport a specified
volume of gas each year from Canada to a point in Chicago.  Such gas volumes are
comprised of a  significant  portion of the Company's  Canadian net  production,
augmented  with  certain  volumes  purchased at  market  prices in  Canada.  The

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


committed  volumes to be transported under the pipeline  transportation  service
agreements are  approximately  78 MMcf of gas per day during 2004 and decline to
approximately  75 MMcf of gas per day by the end of the commitment term. The net
gas  marketing  gains or losses  resulting  from  purchasing  third party gas in
Canada and selling it in Chicago are recorded as other  income or other  expense
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Associated with these
agreements,  the Company recognized $922 thousand, $2.6 million and $9.9 million
of gas marketing  losses in other  expenses  during the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

NOTE J.     Derivative Financial Instruments

Hedge Derivatives

     The Company  utilizes  derivative  instruments to manage  commodity  price,
interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks.

     Fair value  hedges.  The  Company  monitors  the debt  capital  markets and
interest  rate  trends to  identify  opportunities  to enter into and  terminate
interest rate swap contracts with the objective of minimizing  costs of capital.
During the three year period ending December 31, 2003, the Company, from time to
time,  entered into interest rate swap  contracts to hedge a portion of the fair
value of its senior notes.  The terms of the interest rate swap  contracts  were
for notional amounts that matched the scheduled maturity of the bonds,  required
the  counterparties to pay the Company a fixed annual interest rate equal to the
stated bond coupon rates on the notional amounts and required the Company to pay
the counterparties  variable annual interest rates on the notional amounts equal
to the periodic six-month LIBOR plus a weighted average margin.

     During the years  ended  December  31,  2003,  2002 and 2001,  the  Company
recognized  interest savings associated with its interest rate swap contracts of
$29.3 million,  $25.3 million and $7.3 million,  respectively.  During the years
ended  December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001, the Company  terminated  interest rate
swap contracts for cash proceeds,  including accrued interest, of $21.5 million,
$36.3 million and $23.3 million,  respectively. The proceeds attributable to the
fair value of the remaining terms of the terminated  contracts amounted to $18.3
million,  $32.0  million and $21.2  million and are included in  "Proceeds  from
disposition of assets" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
during the years ended  December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001,  respectively.  As of
December  31,  2003 and  2002,  the  Company  was not a party to any fair  value
hedges.

     As of December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the Company's long-term debt
in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  included  $27.4  million of
incremental  carrying value  attributable  to the unamortized net deferred hedge
gains realized from  terminated  fair value hedge interest rate swap  contracts.
The  amortization  of these net  deferred  hedge  gains  reduced  the  Company's
reported  interest  expense by $26.1  million,  $14.1  million and $2.8  million
during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     The following  table sets forth the scheduled  amortization of net deferred
hedge gains and losses on  terminated  fair value hedges as of December 31, 2003
that will be recognized as increases in the case of losses,  or decreases in the
case of gains, to the Company's future interest expense:

     The terms of the fair value hedges  described above  perfectly  matched the
terms of the underlying  senior notes. The Company did not exclude any component
of the derivatives' gains or losses from the measurement of hedge effectiveness.

     Cash flow hedges.  The Company utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts
to (i) reduce the effect of price  volatility  on the  commodities  the  Company
produces and sells,  (ii) support the  Company's  annual  capital  budgeting and
expenditure  plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain
capital projects.  The Company has also utilized interest rate swap contracts to
reduce the effect of interest rate  volatility  on the  Company's  variable rate
line of credit  indebtedness and forward currency  exchange  contracts to reduce
the effect of U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate volatility.

     Oil prices.  All material  sales  contracts  governing  the  Company's  oil
production have been tied directly or indirectly to NYMEX prices.  The following
table sets forth the Company's  outstanding oil hedge contracts and the weighted
average NYMEX prices for those contracts as of December 31, 2003:


     The Company reports average oil prices per Bbl including the effects of oil
quality  adjustments and the net effect of oil hedges.  The following table sets
forth the Company's  oil prices,  both reported  (including  hedge  results) and
realized  (excluding  hedge  results),  and the net effect of settlements of oil
price  hedges on oil revenue for the years ended  December  31,  2003,  2002 and
2001:

     Natural gas liquids prices.  During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, the Company did not enter into any NGL hedge contracts.  There were no
outstanding NGL hedge contracts at December 31, 2003.

     Gas prices.  The  Company  employs a policy of hedging a portion of its gas
production  based on the index  price upon which the gas is  actually  sold,  or
based on NYMEX  prices if NYMEX  prices  are  highly  correlated  with the index
price, in order to mitigate the basis risk between NYMEX prices and actual index
prices.  The  following  table sets forth the  Company's  outstanding  gas hedge
contracts  and the  weighted  average  index  prices for those  contracts  as of
December 31, 2003:


     The Company reports average gas prices per Mcf including the effects of Btu
content,  gas  processing  and shrinkage  adjustments  and the net effect of gas
hedges.  The following table sets forth the Company's gas prices,  both reported
(including hedge results) and realized  (excluding  hedge results),  and the net
effect of settlements of gas price hedges on gas revenue:


     Hedge  ineffectiveness  and excluded items. During the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company  recognized  other expense of $2.8 million,
$1.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively, related to the ineffective portions
of  its  cash  flow  hedging  instruments.   Additionally,  based  on  SFAS  133
interpretive  guidance  that was in  effect  prior to April  2001,  the  Company
excluded from the  measurement  of hedge  effectiveness  changes in the time and
volatility value components of collar contracts  designated as cash flow hedges.
Associated therewith,  the Company recorded other expense of $2.4 million during
the three  month  period  ended  March 31,  2001.  In April  2001,  the  Company
discontinued  the exclusion of time value and volatility from the measurement of
hedge effectiveness.

     Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income (loss) - net deferred hedge gains
(losses),  net of tax. As of December  31,  2003 and 2002,  AOCI - net  deferred
hedge gains  (losses),  net of tax  represented  net  deferred  losses of $104.1

million and net deferred  gains of $9.6  million,  respectively.  The AOCI - net
deferred  hedge gains  (losses),  net of tax balance as of December 31, 2003 was
comprised  of $200.6  million  of net  deferred  hedge  losses on the  effective
portions of open commodity cash flow hedges, $45.1 million of net deferred gains
on terminated  cash flow hedges and $51.4 million of associated net deferred tax
benefits. The AOCI - net deferred hedge gains (losses), net of tax balance as of
December 31, 2002 was comprised of $108.1  million of net deferred  hedge losses
on the effective portions of open commodity cash flow hedges,  $117.4 million of
net deferred gains on terminated  cash flow hedges and $.3 million of associated
net deferred  tax  benefits.  The  decrease in AOCI - net  deferred  hedge gains
(losses),  net of tax during  the year ended  December  31,  2003 was  primarily
attributable to increases in future  commodity  prices relative to the commodity
prices  stipulated  in the  hedge  agreements  and the  reclassification  of net
deferred  hedge  gains to net  income as  derivatives  matured  by their  terms,
partially offset by a $51.1 million  increase in associated  deferred income tax
benefits  (see Note P for  information  regarding  the  Company's  United States
deferred  tax  valuation  allowance).  The net  deferred  hedge gains and losses
associated   with  open  cash  flow  hedges  remain   subject  to  market  price
fluctuations until the positions are either settled under the terms of the hedge
contracts or terminated  prior to settlement.  The net deferred gains and losses
on terminated cash flow hedges are fixed.

     During the twelve  month  period  ending  December  31,  2004,  the Company
expects to reclassify $151.9 million of net deferred losses associated with open
cash flow hedges and $43.9 million of net deferred gains on terminated cash flow
hedges from AOCI - net deferred hedge gains (losses),  net of tax to oil and gas
revenue.  The Company also expects to reclassify  approximately $39.6 million of
deferred  income tax benefits  during the twelve months ended  December 31, 2004
from AOCI-net  deferred hedge gains  (losses),  net of tax to income tax benefit
(provision).

     The  following  table sets  forth the  scheduled  reclassifications  of net
deferred  hedge gains on  terminated  cash flow hedges as of December  31, 2003,
that will be recognized in the Company's future oil and gas revenues:


Non-hedge Derivatives

     Btu swap  contracts.  The  Company  is a party to Btu swap  contracts  that
mature  at the end of 2004.  The Btu swap  contracts  do not  qualify  for hedge
accounting  treatment.  The  Company  recorded  mark-to-market   adjustments  to
decrease the carrying  value of the Btu swap liability by $.7 million during the
year ended  December 31,  2001.  During the year ended  December  31, 2001,  the
Company  entered into  offsetting  Btu swap  contracts  that fixed the Company's
remaining  obligations  associated  with the Btu swap  contracts.  The remaining
undiscounted  future  settlement  obligations  of the Company under the Btu swap
contracts are $7.2 million for 2004.

NOTE K.     Major Customers and Derivative Counterparties

     Sales to major customers.  The Company's share of oil and gas production is
sold to various  purchasers who must be prequalified  under the Company's credit
risk policies and procedures. The Company is of the opinion that the loss of any
one purchaser  would not have an adverse effect on the ability of the Company to
sell its oil and gas production.

     The following  customers  individually  accounted for 10 percent or more of
the consolidated  oil, NGL and gas revenues of the Company during one or more of
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:

     At  December  31,  2003,  the amount  receivable  from  Anadarko  Petroleum
Corporation  was  $1.5  million  which  is  included  in the  caption  "Accounts
receivable - trade,  net" in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. The
Company had no accounts receivable - trade, net from Williams Energy Services at
December 31, 2003.

     Derivative  counterparties.  The Company  uses  credit and other  financial
criteria to evaluate the credit  standing of, and to select,  counterparties  to
its derivative  instruments.  Although the Company does not obtain collateral or
otherwise secure the fair value of its derivative instruments, associated credit
risk is mitigated by the Company's  credit risk policies and  procedures.  As of
December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the Company had $7.6 million of  derivative  assets
for which Enron North  America Corp was the Company's  counterparty.  Associated
therewith,  the  Company  recognized  bad debt  expense of $.4  million and $6.0
million  as  components  of  other  expense  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated
Statements  of  Operations  during the years ended  December  31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

NOTE L.     Asset Retirement Obligations

     As referred to in Note B, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on
January 1, 2003. The Company's asset retirement  obligations primarily relate to
the future plugging and abandonment of proved properties and related facilities.
The Company  does not provide for a market risk  premium  associated  with asset
retirement  obligations  because a reliable  estimate cannot be determined.  The
Company has no assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset
retirement  obligations.  The following  table  summarizes  the Company's  asset
retirement obligation transactions recorded in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 143 during the year ended  December  31,  2003 and in  accordance  with the
provisions of SFAS 19 during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001:

NOTE N.     Asset Divestitures

     During the years  ended  December  31,  2003,  2002 and 2001,  the  Company
completed asset  divestitures for net proceeds of $35.7 million,  $118.9 million
and $113.5 million,  respectively.  Associated  therewith,  the Company recorded
gains on  disposition  of assets of $1.3 million,  $4.4 million and $7.7 million
during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     Hedge  derivative  divestitures.  During the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, the Company terminated,  prior to their scheduled maturity, hedge
derivatives  for cash sales proceeds of $18.3  million,  $91.3 million and $85.4
million,  respectively.  Net gains from these divestitures were deferred and are
being amortized over the original  contract lives of the terminated  derivatives
as reductions to interest expense or increases to oil and gas revenues. See Note
J for more information regarding deferred gains on terminated hedge derivatives.

     Available for sale securities divestitures.  During the year ended December
31, 2001,  the Company sold its remaining  613,250  shares of common stock of an
unaffiliated  entity  for $12.7  million  of cash  proceeds  and  recognized  an
associated gain on disposition of assets of $8.1 million.

     Other United States divestitures.  During the year ended December 31, 2003,
the Company  received  $15.2  million of cash proceeds from the sale of unproved
property  interests and $.9 million of cash proceeds from the sale of other U.S.
corporate assets. Associated with these divestitures,  the Company recorded $1.5
million of net gains.  During the year ended  December  31,  2002,  the  Company
received  $20.9 million of proceeds from the cash  settlement of a gas balancing
receivable,  $4.7  million  from the sale of certain gas  properties  located in
Oklahoma and $1.8 million from the sale of other  corporate  assets.  Associated
with these divestitures, the Company recorded net gains of $4.2 million.

NOTE O.     Other Expense

     The following  table provides the components of the Company's other expense
during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:


NOTE P.     Income Taxes

     The Company  accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income
Taxes"  ("SFAS  109").  The  Company  and  its  eligible   subsidiaries  file  a
consolidated United States federal income tax return.  Certain  subsidiaries are
not eligible to be included in the consolidated United States federal income tax
return and separate  provisions for income taxes have been  determined for these
entities or groups of entities. The tax returns and the amount of taxable income
or loss are subject to examination by United States  federal,  state and foreign
taxing  authorities.  Current and estimated  tax payments of $5.3 million,  $2.3
million and $11.7  million  were made during the years ended  December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

     From 1998 until 2003, the Company maintained a valuation  allowance against
a portion of its  deferred  tax asset  position in the United  States.  SFAS 109
requires that the Company continually assess both positive and negative evidence
to determine  whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets can be
realized  prior to their  expiration.  In the  third  quarter  of 2003 and as of
December 31,  2003,  the Company has  concluded  that it is more likely than not
that it will realize its gross  deferred tax asset position in the United States
after giving consideration to the following specific facts:

o    Over the past several  years,  the Company has been steadily  improving its
     portfolio of assets,  including  significant proved reserve discoveries and
     follow-up  development  projects  that have  recently  started to  produce.
     Specifically, Pioneer completed development activities and began production
     operations on its Canyon  Express gas project in September  2002 and on its
     Company-operated  Falcon  field gas project in March 2003.  The  production
     performance  to-date and the reservoir  data that has been  accumulated  on
     these  projects  provide  assurance  that these  projects  will recover the
     reserves as predicted.

o    During 2003, the Company  announced  additional  Falcon area discoveries in
     the  Harrier,  Tomahawk  and Raptor  fields and during  January  2004,  the
     Harrier development project was completed and began production  operations.
     The Company expects first production from the Tomahawk and Raptor fields in

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


     mid-2004.  The Company also expects to  complete its other significant Gulf
     of Mexico development project, Devils Tower, in mid-2004.

o    Commodity  market  supply and demand  fundamentals  continued  to stabilize
     during the third and fourth quarters of 2003 as evidenced by quoted futures
     prices that suggest that North  American gas prices will remain  relatively
     flat over the next five years and that  worldwide  oil  prices may  decline
     modestly over that time span compared to relatively high current levels for
     each commodity.

o    The Company's future revenues are further  protected against price declines
     through its significant hedging program. The Company has hedged portions of
     its oil price risk  through 2008 and portions of its gas price risk through
     2007. See Note J for information regarding the Company's hedge positions.

o    The Company  generated  record  pretax income for the third quarter of 2003
     and net income in each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and
     2000. The Company also generated taxable income during 2003,  including the
     deduction  of 100 percent of its  intangible  drilling  costs.  The Company
     believes that these trends will continue for the foreseeable future.

o    The Company performed various economic  evaluations in the third quarter of
     2003 to  determine  if the  Company  would  be able to  realize  all of its
     deferred tax assets, including its net operating loss carryforwards,  prior
     to any expiration.  These  evaluations were based on the Company's  reserve
     projections of existing  producing  properties and recent discoveries being
     developed.  These evaluations  employed varying price assumptions,  some of
     which included a significant reduction in commodity prices, and factored in
     limitations on the use of the Company's net operating  loss  carryforwards.
     The evaluations did not include assumptions of increases in proved reserves
     through future exploration or acquisitions.  The evaluations indicated that
     the deferred tax assets are realizable in the future.

     Accordingly,  during the third  quarter of 2003,  the Company  reversed its
remaining valuation allowance in the United States, resulting in the recognition
of a deferred  tax  benefit of $104.7  million.  For 2003 in total,  the Company
reversed $197.7 million of United States valuation allowances resulting in a net
deferred tax benefit for the year.  Further,  the third quarter  reversal of the
allowance  increased  stockholders'  equity  by  $32.6  million  as the  Company
recognized  the tax effects of previous  stock  option  exercises  and  deferred
hedging gains and losses in other comprehensive income.

     Pioneer will continue to monitor Company-specific, oil and gas industry and
worldwide  economic  factors and will reassess the likelihood that the Company's
net operating  loss  carryforwards  and other  deferred tax  attributes  will be
utilized prior to their  expiration.  There can be no assurances  that facts and
circumstances  will not materially change and require the Company to reestablish
a United States deferred tax asset valuation allowance in a future period. As of
December 31, 2003,  the Company does not believe  there is  sufficient  positive
evidence  to  reverse   its   valuation   allowances   related  to  foreign  tax
jurisdictions.

million,  $3.9 million,  $26.3 million,  $17.0  million,  $47.7 million and $9.0
million,  respectively,  which are  available to offset future  regular  taxable
income in each respective tax jurisdiction,  if any.  Additionally,  at December
31,  2003,  the  Company  has   alternative   minimum  tax  net  operating  loss
carryforwards  ("AMT NOLs") in the United  States of $653.0  million,  which are
available to reduce future  alternative  minimum taxable  income,  if any. These
carryforwards expire as follows:

     The  Company  believes  $140.0  million  of the U.S.  NOLs and AMT NOLs are
subject to Section  382 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code and are  limited in each
taxable year to approximately $20.0 million.

NOTE Q.     Income Per Share Before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting
            Principle

     Basic income per share  before  cumulative  effect of change in  accounting
principle is computed by dividing income before  cumulative  effect of change in
accounting principle by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period.  The  computation of diluted income per share before  cumulative
effect of change in accounting  principle  reflects the potential  dilution that
could occur if  securities  or other  contracts  to issue  common stock that are
dilutive to income before  cumulative  effect of change in accounting  principle
were  exercised  or  converted  into common stock or resulted in the issuance of
common stock that would then share in the earnings of the Company.

     The following table is a  reconciliation  of the basic and diluted weighted
average common shares  outstanding  for the years ended December 31, 2003,  2002
and 2001:

Capitalized Costs



Costs Incurred for Oil and Gas Producing Activities (a)













                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                       UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
                  Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


Results of Operations

     Information  about the  Company's  results  of  operations  for oil and gas
producing  activities by geographic  operating segment is presented in Note R of
the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reserve Quantity Information

     The estimates of the  Company's  proved oil and gas reserves as of December
31, 2003 and 2002,  which are located in the United States,  Argentina,  Canada,
Gabon,  South  Africa  and  Tunisia,   were  based  on  evaluations  audited  by
independent  petroleum  engineers with respect to the Company's major properties
and prepared by the Company's  engineers  with respect to all other  properties.
The  estimates of the  Company's  proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31,
2001 were  prepared by the  Company's  engineers.  Reserves  were  estimated  in
accordance with guidelines  established by the SEC and the Financial  Accounting
Standards Board, which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing
economic  and  operating  conditions  with  no  provision  for  price  and  cost
escalations  except by  contractual  arrangements.  The reserve  estimates as of
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 utilize respective oil prices of $31.10, $29.67
and $18.88 per Bbl  (reflecting  adjustments  for oil quality),  respective  NGL
prices of $20.26, $19.01 and $11.58 per Bbl, and respective gas prices of $4.23,
$3.37 and $2.21 per Mcf (reflecting  adjustments for Btu content, gas processing
and shrinkage).

     Oil  and  gas   reserve   quantity   estimates   are  subject  to  numerous
uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in
the  projection  of future  rates of  production  and the timing of  development
expenditures.  The  accuracy of such  estimates  is a function of the quality of
available data and of engineering  and geological  interpretation  and judgment.
Results of subsequent  drilling,  testing and production may cause either upward
or downward revision of previous estimates.  Further,  the volumes considered to
be  commercially  recoverable  fluctuate  with  changes in prices and  operating
costs. The Company  emphasizes that reserve  estimates are inherently  imprecise
and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of currently
producing oil and gas properties.  Accordingly,  these estimates are expected to
change as additional information becomes available in the future.

     The  following  table  provides a rollforward  of total proved  reserves by
geographic  area and in total for the years ended  December 31,  2003,  2002 and
2001, as well as proved developed reserves by geographic area and in total as of
the beginning and end of each respective year:

                       UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Oil and Gas Producing Activities:







                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                       UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
                  Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001


Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

     The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by
applying  year-end  prices of oil and gas (with  consideration  of price changes
only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to the estimated future
production of proved oil and gas reserves  less  estimated  future  expenditures
(based on year-end  costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved
reserves,  discounted  using a rate  of 10  percent  per  year  to  reflect  the
estimated timing of the future cash flows. Future income taxes are calculated by
comparing  undiscounted  future  cash  flows  to the  tax  basis  of oil and gas
properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying the current tax
rates to the  difference.  The  discounted  future  cash flow  estimates  do not
include the effects of the  Company's  commodity  hedging  contracts.  Utilizing
December 31, 2003  commodity  prices held  constant  over each hedge  contract's
term, the net present value of the Company's  hedge  contracts,  less associated
estimated  income  taxes  and  discounted  at 10  percent,  was a  liability  of
approximately $191.0 million.

     Discounted  future  cash flow  estimates  like  those  shown  below are not
intended to  represent  estimates  of the fair value of oil and gas  properties.
Estimates  of fair value should also  consider  probable  reserves,  anticipated
future oil and gas prices, interest rates, changes in development and production
costs and risks  associated with future  production.  Because of these and other
considerations,  any  estimate  of fair  value  is  necessarily  subjective  and
imprecise.

     The following tables provide the standardized  measure of discounted future
cash flows by  geographic  area and in total for the years  ended  December  31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, as well as a rollforward in total for each respective year:
