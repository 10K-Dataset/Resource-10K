Evergreen
    Merger

On September 28, 2004, Pioneer completed a merger with
    Evergreen Resources, Inc. (“Evergreen”). Pioneer
    acquired the common stock of Evergreen for a total purchase
    price of approximately $1.8 billion, which was comprised of
    cash and Pioneer common stock. Evergreen was a publicly-traded
    independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the
    production, development, exploration and acquisition of North
    American unconventional natural gas. Evergreen’s operations
    were principally focused on developing and expanding its coal
    bed methane (“CBM”) field located in the Raton Basin
    in southern Colorado. Evergreen also had operations in the
    Piceance Basin in western Colorado, the Uinta Basin in eastern
    Utah and the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. See Note C
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” for more information regarding the Evergreen merger.

Mission
    and Strategies

The Company’s mission is to enhance shareholder investment
    returns through strategies that maximize Pioneer’s
    long-term profitability and net asset value. The strategies
    employed to achieve this mission are predicated on maintaining
    financial flexibility and capital allocation discipline. These
    strategies are anchored by the Company’s long-lived
    Spraberry oil field and Hugoton, Raton and West Panhandle gas
    fields’ reserves and production which have an estimated
    remaining productive life in excess of 40 years. Underlying
    these fields are approximately 78 percent of the
    Company’s proved oil and gas reserves as of
    December 31, 2005.



Recent strategic initiatives.

During
    September 2005, the Company announced that its board of
    directors (the “Board”) approved significant strategic
    initiatives intended to enhance shareholder value and investment
    returns. Together with other important initiatives, the Board
    approved:

•

A $1 billion share repurchase program, $650 million of
    which was immediately initiated and substantially completed
    during 2005 and $350 million of which is subject to the
    completion of the planned deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentina
    divestitures discussed below.

•

A plan to divest the Company’s assets in the Tierra del
    Fuego area in southern Argentina. The plan was later broadened
    to include entertaining offers for a complete sale of all of the
    Company’s Argentine assets. During January 2006, Pioneer
    entered into an agreement to sell its assets in Argentina for
    $675 million.

•

A plan to divest the Company’s assets in the deepwater Gulf
    of Mexico. Bids to purchase the properties were received in
    January 2006 and the Company is currently engaged in
    negotiations for the sale of these assets. No assurance can be
    given that a sale can be completed on terms acceptable to the
    Company.

The implementation of the Board’s strategic initiatives is
    allowing Pioneer to (i) allocate and focus its investment
    capital more heavily towards predictable oil and gas basins in
    North America that have delivered relatively strong and
    consistent growth and (ii) lower its risk profile by
    expanding North American unconventional resource investments
    while reducing higher-risk exploration expenditures.

The divestiture of the Company’s Argentine oil and gas
    assets will allow the Company to leverage the current commodity
    price environment to monetize and exit operations in an area
    that has become characterized by lower operating margins,
    government-controlled pricing and modest production growth
    opportunities. The divestiture of the Company’s deepwater
    Gulf of Mexico assets, if successful, will also allow the
    Company to monetize and exit operations in an area that is
    characterized by escalating drilling and operating costs and
    relatively high exploration risk and production volatility.

During 2006, the Company plans to: (i) selectively explore
    for and develop proved reserve discoveries in areas that it
    believes will offer superior reserve growth and profitability
    potential; (ii) evaluate opportunities to acquire oil and
    gas properties that will complement the Company’s
    exploration and development drilling activities;
    (iii) invest in the personnel and technology necessary to
    maximize the Company’s exploration and development
    successes; and (iv) enhance liquidity, allowing the Company
    to take advantage of future exploration, development and
    acquisition opportunities. The Company is committed to
    continuing to enhance shareholder investment returns through
    adherence to these strategies.

Business
    Activities

The Company is an independent oil and gas exploration and
    production company. Pioneer’s purpose is to competitively
    and profitably explore for, develop and produce oil, NGL and gas
    reserves. In so doing, the Company sells homogenous oil, NGL and
    gas units which, except for geographic and relatively minor
    qualitative differentials, cannot be significantly
    differentiated from units offered for sale by the Company’s
    competitors. Competitive advantage is gained in the oil and gas
    exploration and development industry by employing experienced
    management and staff that will lead the Company to prudent
    capital investment decisions, technological innovation and price
    and cost management.

Petroleum industry.

The petroleum
    industry has generally been characterized by rising oil, NGL and
    gas commodity prices during 2005 and recent years. During 2005,
    the Company has also been affected by increasing costs,
    particularly higher drilling and well servicing rig rates and
    drilling supplies. During recent years, world oil prices have
    increased in response to increases in demand in Asian economies,
    hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico and supply disruptions
    and threatened disruptions in the Middle East and Venezuela.
    North American gas prices have improved as overall demand
    fundamentals have strengthened while supply uncertainties still
    remain. Significant factors that will impact 2006 commodity
    prices include developments in the issues currently impacting
    Iraq and Iran and the Middle East in general; the extent to
    which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
    Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil exporting nations are
    able to continue to manage oil supply through export quotas; and
    overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals. To
    mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on the
    Company’s net asset value, Pioneer utilizes commodity hedge
    contracts. See



“Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk” and Note J of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” for information
    regarding the impact to oil and gas revenues during 2005, 2004
    and 2003 from the Company’s hedging activities and the
    Company’s open hedge positions at December 31, 2005.

The Company.

The Company’s asset
    base is anchored by the Spraberry oil field located in West
    Texas, the Hugoton gas field located in Southwest Kansas, the
    Raton gas field located in southern Colorado and the West
    Panhandle gas field located in the Texas Panhandle.
    Complementing these areas, the Company has exploration and
    development opportunities

and/or

oil
    and gas production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, the onshore
    Gulf Coast area and in Alaska, and internationally in Argentina,
    Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia.
    Combined, these assets create a portfolio of resources and
    opportunities that are well balanced among oil, NGLs and gas,
    and that are also well balanced between long-lived, dependable
    production and exploration and development opportunities.
    Additionally, the Company has a team of dedicated employees that
    represent the professional disciplines and sciences that will
    allow Pioneer to maximize the long-term profitability and net
    asset value inherent in its physical assets.

The Company provides administrative, financial and management
    support to United States and foreign subsidiaries that explore
    for, develop and produce oil, NGL and gas reserves. Production
    operations are principally located domestically in Texas,
    Kansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Utah and the Gulf of Mexico, and
    internationally in Argentina, Canada, South Africa and Tunisia.

Production.

The Company focuses its
    efforts towards maximizing its average daily production of oil,
    NGLs and gas through development drilling, production
    enhancement activities and acquisitions of producing properties
    while minimizing the controllable costs associated with the
    production activities. During the year ended December 31,
    2005, the Company’s average daily production, on a BOE
    basis, decreased as a result of (i) production curtailments
    in the Gulf of Mexico resulting from 2004 and 2005 hurricane
    damages, (ii) production curtailment in the United States
    Mid-Continent area during mid-May through mid-July due to the
    fire at the Company’s Fain gas plant and (iii) full
    production of recoverable reserves from the Harrier field in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico during the third quarter of 2005.
    Partially offsetting these decreases in production volumes were
    (i) a full year of gas production from the properties
    acquired in the Evergreen merger, (ii) increased production
    from the Company’s Devils Tower oil field in the deepwater
    Gulf of Mexico despite hurricane disruptions,
    (iii) increased production from the Company’s Raptor
    and Tomahawk gas fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and
    (iv) increased production from the Company’s Argentine
    and Canadian subsidiaries, primarily in response to increased
    development drilling. Production, price and cost information
    with respect to the Company’s properties for 2005, 2004 and
    2003 is set forth under “Item 2.
    Properties — Selected Oil and Gas
    Information — Production, Price and Cost
    Data”.

The aforementioned divestitures of the Argentine and deepwater
    Gulf of Mexico assets, if successfully completed, will
    significantly reduce the Company’s 2006 production volumes.

Drilling activities.

The Company seeks
    to increase its oil and gas reserves, production and cash flow
    through exploratory and development drilling and by conducting
    other production enhancement activities, such as well
    recompletions. During the three years ended December 31,
    2005, the Company drilled 1,626 gross (1,484 net)
    wells, 91 percent of which were successfully completed as
    productive wells, at a total drilling cost (net to the
    Company’s interest) of $2.1 billion.

The Company believes that its current property base provides a
    substantial inventory of prospects for future reserve,
    production and cash flow growth. The Company’s proved
    reserves as of December 31, 2005 include proved undeveloped
    reserves and proved developed reserves that are behind pipe of
    196 MMBOE of oil and NGLs and 1,233 Bcf of gas.
    Development of these proved reserves will require future capital
    expenditures. The timing of the development of these reserves
    will be dependent upon the commodity price environment, the
    Company’s expected operating cash flows and the
    Company’s financial condition. The Company believes that
    its current portfolio of proved reserves and unproved prospects
    provides attractive development and exploration opportunities
    for at least the next three to five years.



Exploratory activities.

The Company has
    devoted significant efforts and resources to hiring and
    developing a highly skilled exploration staff as well as
    acquiring a portfolio of exploration opportunities. During
    September 2005, the Company announced that the Board approved
    strategic initiatives to implement a plan to exit exploration in
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Tierra del Fuego area in
    Argentina and to focus its exploration efforts in onshore North
    America, Alaska and Africa. Associated therewith, and pending
    approval of a 2006 capital spending budget, the Company plans to
    reduce its 2006 exploration budget to less than 20 percent
    of the total 2006 capital budget. The Company anticipates that
    its 2006 exploration efforts will be concentrated domestically
    in the onshore Gulf Coast area, the Rocky Mountain area and
    Alaska, and internationally in Africa and Canada. Exploratory
    drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find
    commercial quantities of hydrocarbons than development drilling
    or enhanced recovery activities. See “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors — Drilling activities” below.

Acquisition activities.

The Company
    regularly seeks to acquire properties that complement its
    operations, provide exploration and development opportunities
    and potentially provide superior returns on investment. In
    addition, the Company pursues strategic acquisitions that will
    allow the Company to expand into new geographical areas that
    feature producing properties and provide
    exploration/exploitation opportunities. During 2005, 2004 and
    2003, the Company invested $269.7 million,
    $2.6 billion (including $2.5 billion associated with
    the Evergreen merger) and $151.0 million, respectively, of
    acquisition capital to purchase proved oil and gas properties,
    including additional interests in its existing assets, and to
    acquire new prospects for future exploitation and exploration
    activities. See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data” for a description of the
    Company’s acquisitions during 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The Company periodically evaluates and pursues acquisition
    opportunities (including opportunities to acquire particular oil
    and gas properties or related assets; entities owning oil and
    gas properties or related assets; and opportunities to engage in
    mergers, consolidations or other business combinations with such
    entities) and at any given time may be in various stages of
    evaluating such opportunities. Such stages may take the form of
    internal financial analysis, oil and gas reserve analysis, due
    diligence, the submission of an indication of interest,
    preliminary negotiations, negotiation of a letter of intent or
    negotiation of a definitive agreement. The success of any
    acquisition will depend on a number of factors. See
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Acquisitions”.

Asset divestitures.

The Company
    regularly reviews its asset base for the purpose of identifying
    nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase
    capital resources available for other activities and create
    organizational and operational efficiencies. While the Company
    generally does not dispose of assets solely for the purpose of
    reducing debt, such dispositions can have the result of
    furthering the Company’s objective of increasing financial
    flexibility through reduced debt levels.

During September 2005, the Company announced that the Board had
    approved a series of strategic initiatives, including a plan to
    divest the Company’s nonoperated Tierra del Fuego interests
    in southern Argentina and the Company’s deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico portfolio. During the Argentine sale process, the Company
    had indications from several potential buyers that they could
    enhance their value for a transaction in Argentina if it
    included all of the Company’s properties. Consequently, the
    Company expressed its willingness to entertain offers for a
    complete exit from Argentina. During January 2006, the Company
    announced signing an agreement with Apache Corporation to sell
    all of its assets in Argentina for $675 million, subject to
    normal closing adjustments. The sale to Apache Corporation is
    expected to close during the latter part of the first quarter or
    in early April of 2006.

The deepwater Gulf of Mexico bid process has been completed and
    the Company is currently engaged in negotiations for the sale of
    the properties. No assurance can be given that a sale can be
    completed on terms acceptable to the Company.

During 2005, the Company’s material divestitures consisted
    of (i) the sale of three volumetric production payments
    (“VPPs”) in the Spraberry and Hugoton fields for net
    proceeds of approximately $892.6 million, (ii) the
    sale of all of its interests in the Martin Creek, Conroy Black
    and Lookout Butte oil and gas properties in Canada for net
    proceeds of $197.2 million, which resulted in a gain of
    $138.3 million that is included in the Company’s
    discontinued operations; (iii) the sale of all of its
    interests in certain oil and gas properties on the shelf of the
    Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $59.1 million, which
    resulted in a gain of $27.7 million that is included in the
    Company’s discontinued operations; and (iv) the sale
    of all of its shares in a subsidiary that owns the interest in
    the Olowi block in Gabon for net proceeds of $47.9 million,
    which resulted in a gain of $47.5 million that is included
    in



the Company’s 2005 income from continuing operations. The
    net cash proceeds were primarily used to fund additions to oil
    and gas properties or to reduce the Company’s outstanding
    indebtedness. See Notes N and T of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” for specific information
    regarding the Company’s asset divestitures and VPPs entered
    into by the Company during 2005.

The Company anticipates that it will continue to sell
    nonstrategic properties or other assets from time to time to
    increase capital resources available for other activities, to
    achieve operating and administrative efficiencies and to improve
    profitability.

Operations
    by Geographic Area

The Company operates in one industry segment, that being oil and
    gas exploration and production. See Note R of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for geographic
    operating segment information, including results of operations
    and segment assets.

Marketing
    of Production

General.

Production from the
    Company’s properties is marketed using methods that are
    consistent with industry practices. Sales prices for oil, NGL
    and gas production are negotiated based on factors normally
    considered in the industry, such as the index or spot price for
    gas or the posted price for oil, price regulations, distance
    from the well to the pipeline, well pressure, estimated
    reserves, commodity quality and prevailing supply conditions. In
    Argentina, the Company receives significantly lower prices for
    its production as a result of the Argentine government’s
    imposed price limitations. See “Qualitative
    Disclosures” in “Item 7A. Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional
    discussion of Argentine foreign currency, operations and price
    risk.

Significant purchasers.

During 2005,
    the Company’s primary purchasers of oil, NGLs and gas were
    Williams Power Company, Inc. (nine percent), Occidental Energy
    Marketing, Inc. (nine percent), ConocoPhillips (seven percent),
    Plains Marketing LP (seven percent) and Tenaska Marketing (six
    percent). The Company is of the opinion that the loss of any one
    purchaser would not have an adverse effect on its ability to
    sell its oil, NGL and gas production.

Hedging activities.

The Company
    utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to
    (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the
    commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support
    the Company’s annual capital budgeting and expenditure
    plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with
    certain capital projects. See “Item 7.
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations” for a description of the
    Company’s hedging activities, “Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”
    and Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for information concerning the impact
    on oil and gas revenues during 2005, 2004 and 2003 from the
    Company’s commodity hedging activities and the
    Company’s open commodity hedge positions at
    December 31, 2005.

Competition,
    Markets and Regulations

Competition.

The oil and gas industry
    is highly competitive. A large number of companies, including
    major integrated and other independent companies, and
    individuals engage in the exploration for and development of oil
    and gas properties, and there is a high degree of competition
    for oil and gas properties suitable for development or
    exploration. Acquisitions of oil and gas properties have been an
    important element of the Company’s growth. The Company
    intends to continue to acquire oil and gas properties that
    complement its operations, provide exploration and development
    opportunities and potentially provide superior returns on
    investment. The principal competitive factors in the acquisition
    of oil and gas properties include the staff and data necessary
    to identify, evaluate and purchase such properties and the
    financial resources necessary to acquire and develop the
    properties. Higher recent commodity prices have increased the
    cost of properties available for acquisition. Many of the
    Company’s competitors are substantially larger and have
    financial and other resources greater than those of the Company.



Markets.

The Company’s ability to
    produce and market oil, NGLs and gas profitably depends on
    numerous factors beyond the Company’s control. The effect
    of these factors cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated.
    Although the Company cannot predict the occurrence of events
    that may affect these commodity prices or the degree to which
    these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that
    the Company produces will generally approximate current market
    prices in the geographic region of the production.

Governmental regulations.

Enterprises
    that sell securities in public markets are subject to regulatory
    oversight by agencies such as the SEC and the NYSE. This
    regulatory oversight imposes on the Company the responsibility
    for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
    procedures that will ensure that material information relating
    to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known
    to the Company’s management and that the financial
    statements and other financial information included in
    submissions to the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a
    material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
    the statements made in such submissions not misleading.

Oil and gas exploration and production operations are also
    subject to various types of regulation by local, state, federal
    and foreign agencies. Additionally, the Company’s
    operations are subject to state conservation laws and
    regulations, including provisions for the unitization or pooling
    of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of
    production from wells and the regulation of spacing, plugging
    and abandonment of wells. States and foreign governments also
    generally impose a production or severance tax with respect to
    the production and sale of oil and gas within their respective
    jurisdictions. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry
    increases the Company’s cost of doing business and,
    consequently, affects its profitability.

Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil
    and gas industry are considered from time to time by the United
    States Congress, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, state
    regulatory bodies, the courts and foreign governments. The
    Company cannot predict when or if any such proposals might
    become effective or their effect, if any, on the Company’s
    operations.

Environmental and health controls.

The
    Company’s operations are subject to numerous
    U.S. federal, state and local, as well as foreign, laws and
    regulations governing the discharge of substances into the
    environment or otherwise relating to environmental and health
    protection. These laws and regulations may require the
    acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the
    type, quantities and concentration of various substances that
    can be released into the environment in connection with drilling
    and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities
    on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other
    protected areas and impose substantial liabilities for pollution
    resulting from oil and gas operations. The Company’s
    inability to obtain these permits in a timely manner or at all
    could cause delays or otherwise negatively impact the
    Company’s ability to implement its business plans. Failure
    to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may
    result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal
    penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the
    issuance of injunctions that limit or prevent operations.
    Although the Company believes that compliance with U.S. and
    foreign environmental laws and regulations will not have a
    material adverse effect on its future results of operations or
    financial condition, risks of substantial costs and liabilities
    are inherent in oil and gas operations, and there can be no
    assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be
    incurred or that curtailment in production or processing might
    not arise as a result of such compliance. Moreover, it is
    possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental
    laws and regulations or claims for damages to property or
    persons resulting from the Company’s operations, could
    result in substantial costs and liabilities.

In the U.S., the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known
    as the “Superfund” law, imposes liability, without
    regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on
    certain classes of persons with respect to the release of a
    “hazardous substance” into the environment. These
    persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or
    sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or
    arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances released at
    the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of
    hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and
    several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the
    hazardous substances that have been released into the
    environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not
    uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to
    file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly
    caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.



The Company generates wastes in the U.S., including hazardous
    wastes, that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation
    and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state
    statutes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and
    various state agencies have limited the approved methods of
    disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.
    Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the Company’s oil
    and gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as
    hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous
    wastes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly
    operating and disposal requirements.

The Company currently owns or leases, and has in the past owned
    or leased, properties in the U.S. that for many years have been
    used for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves.
    Although the Company has used operating and disposal practices
    that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or
    other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under
    the properties owned or leased by the Company or on or under
    other locations where such hydrocarbons or wastes have been
    taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of these
    properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment
    and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not
    under the Company’s control. These properties and the
    hydrocarbons or wastes disposed thereon may be subject to
    CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, the
    Company could be required to remove or remediate previously
    disposed wastes or property contamination or to perform remedial
    plugging operations to prevent future contamination.

Federal regulations require certain owners or operators of
    facilities that store or otherwise handle oil, such as the
    Company, to prepare and implement spill prevention control
    plans, countermeasure plans and facility response plans relating
    to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil
    Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amends certain
    provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972,
    commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”),
    and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and
    response to oil spills into navigable waters of the U.S. The OPA
    subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several
    liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain
    other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited
    to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface
    waters. The CWA provides penalties for any discharges of
    petroleum products in reportable quantities and imposes
    substantial liability for the costs of removing a spill. OPA
    requires responsible parties to establish and maintain evidence
    of financial responsibility to cover removal costs and damages
    resulting from an oil spill. OPA calls for a financial
    responsibility of $35 million to cover pollution cleanup
    for offshore facilities. State laws for the control of water
    pollution also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and
    liabilities in the case of releases of petroleum or its
    derivatives into surface waters or into the ground. The Company
    does not believe that the OPA, CWA or related state laws are any
    more burdensome to it than they are to other similarly situated
    oil and gas companies.

Many states in which the Company operates regulate naturally
    occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) and NORM
    wastes that are generated in connection with oil and gas
    exploration and production activities. NORM wastes typically
    consist of very low-level radioactive substances that become
    concentrated in pipes and production equipment. Certain state
    regulations require the testing of pipes and production
    equipment for the presence of NORM, the licensing of
    NORM-contaminated facilities and the careful handling and
    disposal of NORM wastes. The Company believes the regulation of
    NORM has minimal effect on its operations because the Company
    generates only small quantities of NORM on an annual basis.

The Company’s field operations in the U.S. involve the use
    of gas-fired compressors, which are subject to the federal Clean
    Air Act and analogous state laws governing the control and
    permitting of air emissions. The Company believes that it is in
    substantial compliance with applicable permitting and control
    technology requirements of such laws and regulations; however,
    in the future, additional facilities could become subject to
    additional permitting, monitoring and pollution control
    requirements as compressor facilities are expanded.

The Company’s operations outside of the U.S. are
    potentially subject to similar foreign governmental controls
    relating to protection of the environment. The Company believes
    that compliance with existing requirements of these foreign
    governmental bodies has not had a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The nature of the business activities conducted by the Company
    subjects it to certain hazards and risks. The following is a
    summary of some of the material risks relating to the
    Company’s business activities. Other risks are



described in “Item 1.
    Business — Competition, Markets and
    Regulations” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”. If any of these
    risks actually occur, they could materially harm the
    Company’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations and impair Pioneer’s ability to implement
    business plans or complete development projects as scheduled. In
    that case, the market price of the Company’s common stock
    could decline.

Commodity prices.

The Company’s
    revenues, profitability, cash flow and future rate of growth are
    highly dependent on oil and gas prices, which are affected by
    numerous factors beyond the Company’s control.
    Historically, oil and gas prices have been very volatile. A
    significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues,
    profitability and cash flow and could, under certain
    circumstances, result in a reduction in the carrying value of
    the Company’s oil and gas properties and goodwill and the
    recognition of deferred tax asset valuation allowances or an
    increase to the Company’s deferred tax asset valuation
    allowances, depending on the Company’s tax attributes in
    each country in which it has activities. Pioneer makes price
    assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a
    significant portion of the Company’s operating expenses,
    including rent, salaries and noncancellable capital commitments,
    is largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are
    below expectations, Pioneer’s financial results are likely
    to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these
    expenses are not variable in the short term and cannot be
    quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in
    commodity prices.

Drilling activities.

Drilling involves
    numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially
    productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost
    of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain
    and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as
    a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling
    conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment
    failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions and shortages
    or delays in the delivery of equipment. The Company’s
    future drilling activities may not be successful and, if
    unsuccessful, such failure could have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s future results of operations and financial
    condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or
    exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves
    greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial
    quantities of hydrocarbons. The Company expects that it will
    continue to experience exploration and abandonment expense in
    2006 even though less than 20 percent of the Company’s
    2006 capital budget is devoted to higher-risk exploratory
    projects. Increased levels of drilling activity in the oil and
    gas industry in recent periods have led to reduced availability,
    extended delivery times and increased costs of some drilling
    equipment, materials and supplies. The Company expects that
    these trends will continue in the foreseeable future and, if so,
    will impact the Company’s profitability, cash flow and
    ability to complete development projects as scheduled.

Unproved properties.

At
    December 31, 2005, the Company carried unproved property
    costs of $313.9 million.  GAAP requires periodic evaluation
    of these costs on a

project-by-project

basis in comparison to their estimated fair value. These
    evaluations will be affected by the results of exploration
    activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or
    expiration of all or a portion of the leases, contracts and
    permits appurtenant to such projects. If the quantity of
    potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not
    sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project,
    the Company will recognize noncash charges in the earnings of
    future periods.

Acquisitions.

Acquisitions of producing
    oil and gas properties have been a key element of the
    Company’s growth. The Company’s growth following the
    full development of its existing property base could be impeded
    if it is unable to acquire additional oil and gas reserves on a
    profitable basis. The success of any acquisition will depend on
    a number of factors, including the ability to estimate
    accurately the costs to develop the reserves, the recoverable
    volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net
    revenues attainable from the reserves and the assessment of
    possible environmental liabilities. All of these factors affect
    whether an acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows
    sufficient to provide a suitable return on investment. Even
    though the Company performs a review of the properties it seeks
    to acquire that it believes is consistent with industry
    practices, such reviews are often limited in scope.



Divestitures.

The Company regularly
    reviews its property base for the purpose of identifying
    nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase
    capital resources available for other activities and create
    organizational and operational efficiencies. Various factors
    could materially affect the ability of the Company to dispose of
    nonstrategic assets, including the availability of purchasers
    willing to purchase the nonstrategic assets at prices acceptable
    to the Company.

Operation of gas processing plants.

As
    of December 31, 2005, the Company owned interests in 12 gas
    processing plants and three treating facilities. The Company
    operates eight of the plants and all three treating facilities.
    There are significant risks associated with the operation of gas
    processing plants. For example, in May 2005, the Company’s
    Fain gas plant was shut in for two months due to a mechanical
    failure that resulted in a fire. Gas and NGLs are volatile and
    explosive and may include carcinogens. Damage to or misoperation
    of a gas processing plant or facility could result in an
    explosion or the discharge of toxic gases, which could result in
    significant damage claims in addition to interrupting a revenue
    source.

Operating hazards and uninsured
    losses.

The Company’s operations are
    subject to all the risks normally incident to the oil and gas
    exploration and production business, including blowouts,
    cratering, explosions, adverse weather effects and pollution and
    other environmental damage, any of which could result in
    substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life,
    damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or
    other property,

clean-up

responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and
    suspension of operations. Increased hurricane activity over the
    past two years has resulted in production curtailments and
    physical damage to the Company’s Gulf of Mexico operations.
    Although the Company currently maintains insurance coverage that
    it considers reasonable and that is similar to that maintained
    by comparable companies in the oil and gas industry, it is not
    fully insured against certain of these risks, either because
    such insurance is not available or because of the high premium
    costs and deductibles associated with obtaining such insurance.

Environmental.

The oil and gas business
    is subject to environmental hazards, such as oil spills,
    produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of
    substances or gases that could expose the Company to substantial
    liability due to pollution and other environmental damage. A
    variety of United States federal, state and local, as well as
    foreign laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of
    the oil and gas business. Noncompliance with these laws and
    regulations may subject the Company to administrative, civil, or
    criminal penalties, remedial cleanups, and natural resource
    damages or other liabilities and compliance may increase the
    cost of the Company’s operations. Such laws and regulations
    may also affect the costs of acquisitions. See
    “Item 1. Business — Competition,
    Markets and Regulations — Environmental and
    health controls” above for additional discussion related to
    environmental risks.

The Company does not believe that its environmental risks are
    materially different from those of comparable companies in the
    oil and gas industry. Nevertheless, no assurance can be given
    that future environmental laws will not result in a curtailment
    of production or processing activities, result in a material
    increase in the costs of production, development, exploration or
    processing operations or adversely affect the Company’s
    future operations and financial condition. Pollution and similar
    environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.

Debt restrictions and availability.

The
    Company is a borrower under fixed rate senior notes and a
    variable rate credit facility. The terms of the Company’s
    borrowings under the senior notes and the credit facility
    specify scheduled debt repayments and require the Company to
    comply with certain associated covenants and restrictions. The
    Company’s ability to comply with the debt repayment terms,
    associated covenants and restrictions is dependent on, among
    other things, factors outside the Company’s direct control,
    such as commodity prices and interest rates. See Note F of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” for information regarding the Company’s
    outstanding debt as of December 31, 2005 and the terms
    associated therewith.

The Company’s ability to obtain additional financing is
    also impacted by the Company’s debt credit ratings and
    competition for available debt financing. See “Item 7.
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations” for a discussion of the
    Company’s debt credit ratings.

Competition.

The oil and gas industry
    is highly competitive. The Company competes with other
    companies, producers and operators for acquisitions and in the
    exploration, development, production and marketing of oil and



gas. Some of these competitors have substantially greater
    financial and other resources than the Company. See
    “Item 1. Business — Competition,
    Markets and Regulations” above for additional discussion
    regarding competition.

Government regulation.

The
    Company’s business is regulated by a variety of federal,
    state, local and foreign laws and regulations. There can be no
    assurance that present or future regulations will not adversely
    affect the Company’s business and operations. See
    “Item 1. Business — Competition,
    Markets and Regulations” above for additional discussion
    regarding government regulation.

International operations.

At
    December 31, 2005, approximately 14 percent of the
    Company’s proved reserves of oil, NGLs and gas were located
    outside the United States (ten percent in Argentina, two percent
    in Canada and two percent in Africa). The success and
    profitability of international operations may be adversely
    affected by risks associated with international activities,
    including economic and labor conditions, political instability,
    tax laws (including host-country import-export, excise and
    income taxes and United States taxes on foreign subsidiaries)
    and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
    local currencies in which oil and gas producing activities may
    be denominated. To the extent that the Company is involved in
    international activities, changes in exchange rates may
    adversely affect the Company’s future results of operations
    and financial condition. See “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” included in “Item 7. Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations”, “Qualitative Disclosures” in
    “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk” and Note B of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” for information specific
    to Argentina’s economic and political situation and other
    risks associated with the Company’s international
    operations. The aforementioned planned sale of Argentine assets,
    if completed, will significantly reduce the Company’s
    international operations.

Estimates of reserves and future net
    revenues.

Numerous uncertainties exist in
    estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues
    therefrom. The estimates of proved reserves and related future
    net revenues set forth in this Report are based on various
    assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.

Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating
    underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured
    in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil
    and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a
    number of variable factors and assumptions, including the
    following:

•

historical production from the area compared with production
    from other producing areas,

•

the quality and quantity of available data,

•

the interpretation of that data,

•

the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies,

•

assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices and

•

assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance, ad
    valorem and excise taxes, development costs and workover and
    remedial costs.

Because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective,
    each of the following items may differ materially from those
    assumed in estimating reserves:

•

the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered,

•

the production and operating costs incurred,

•

the amount and timing of future development expenditures and

•

future oil and gas sales prices.

Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different
    estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available
    data. The Company’s actual production, revenues and
    expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different
    from estimates and the differences may be material.



As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash
    flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and
    costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices
    and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net
    cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:

•

the amount and timing of actual production,

•

increases or decreases in the supply or demand of oil and
    gas and

•

changes in governmental regulations or taxation.

The Company reports all proved reserves held under production
    sharing arrangements and concessions utilizing the
    “economic interest” method, which excludes the host
    country’s share of proved reserves. Estimated quantities of
    production sharing arrangements reported under the
    “economic interest” method are subject to fluctuations
    in the price of oil and gas and recoverable operating expenses
    and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities
    attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to
    changes in commodity prices.

Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a
    common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the
    rules and regulations of the SEC. It requires the use of oil and
    gas prices, as well as operating and development costs,
    prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, it may
    not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be
    received for oil and gas production because of seasonal price
    fluctuations or other varying market conditions, nor may it
    reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or
    develop the oil and gas properties. Accordingly, estimates
    included herein of future net revenues may be materially
    different from the net revenues that are ultimately received.
    Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows or
    Standardized Measure in this Report should not be construed as
    accurate estimates of the current market value of the
    Company’s proved reserves.

Stock repurchases.

During 2005, the
    Company repurchased 20 million shares of its common stock,
    and announced its intention to repurchase up to an additional
    $350 million of its common stock, subject to completion of
    the planned divestiture of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico and
    Argentine assets. The Board sets limits on the price per share
    at which Pioneer’s common stock can be repurchased, and the
    Company will not be permitted to repurchase its stock during
    certain periods because of scheduled and unscheduled trading
    blackouts. Additionally, business conditions and availability of
    capital may dictate that repurchases be suspended or cancelled.
    As a result, there can be no assurance that additional
    repurchases will be commenced and, if so, that they will be
    completed.

Commodity hedges.

To the extent that
    the Company engages in hedging activities to reduce commodity
    price risk, Pioneer may be prevented from realizing the benefits
    of price increases above the levels of the hedges. See
    “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk”.

PROPERTIES

The information included in this Report about the Company’s
    oil, NGL and gas reserves as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and
    2003, which are located in the United States, Argentina, Canada,
    South Africa and Tunisia, were based on evaluations prepared by
    the Company’s engineers and audited by Netherland,
    Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”) with
    respect to the Company’s major properties and prepared by
    the Company’s engineers with respect to all other
    properties. The reserve audits performed by NSAI in aggregate
    represented 82 percent, 88 percent and 87 percent
    of the Company’s 2005, 2004 and 2003 proved reserves,
    respectively; and, 76 percent, 84 percent and
    89 percent of the Company’s 2005, 2004 and 2003
    associated present value of proved reserves discounted at ten
    percent, respectively.

NSAI follows the general principles set forth in the standards
    pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserve
    information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers
    (“SPE”). A reserve audit as defined



by the SPE is not the same as a financial audit. The SPE’s
    definition of a reserve audit includes the following concepts:

•

A reserve audit is an examination of reserve information that is
    conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether
    such reserve information, in the aggregate, is reasonable and
    has been presented in conformity with generally accepted
    petroleum engineering and evaluation principles.

•

The estimation of proved reserves is an imprecise science due to
    the many unknown geologic and reservoir factors that cannot be
    estimated through sampling techniques. Since reserves are only
    estimates, they cannot be audited for the purpose of verifying
    exactness. Instead, reserve information is audited for the
    purpose of reviewing in sufficient detail the policies,
    procedures and methods used by a company in estimating its
    reserves so that the reserve auditors may express an opinion as
    to whether, in the aggregate, the reserve information furnished
    by a company is reasonable and has been estimated and presented
    in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and
    evaluation principles.

•

The methods and procedures used by a company, and the reserve
    information furnished by a company, must be reviewed in
    sufficient detail to permit the reserve auditor, in its
    professional judgment, to express an opinion as to the
    reasonableness of the reserve information. The auditing
    procedures require the reserve auditor to prepare its own
    estimates of reserve information for the audited properties.

To further clarify, in conjunction with the audits of the
    Company’s proved reserves and associated present value
    discounted at ten percent, the Company provided to NSAI its
    external and internal engineering and geoscience technical data
    and analyses. Based on NSAI’s review of that data, they had
    the option of honoring the Company’s interpretation, or
    making their own interpretation. No data was withheld from them.
    NSAI accepted without independent verification the accuracy and
    completeness of the historical information and data furnished by
    the Company with respect to ownership interest; oil and gas
    production; well test data; oil, NGL and gas prices; operating
    and development costs; and any agreements relating to current
    and future operations of the properties and sales of production.
    However, if in the course of their evaluation something came to
    their attention which brought into question the validity or
    sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely
    on such information or data until they had satisfactorily
    resolved their questions relating thereto or had independently
    verified such information or data.

In the course of their evaluations, NSAI prepared, for all of
    the audited properties, their own estimates of the
    Company’s proved reserves and present value of such
    reserves discounted at ten percent. NSAI’s estimates of
    those proved reserves and present value of such reserves
    discounted at ten percent did not differ from the Company’s
    estimates by more than ten percent in the aggregate. However,
    when compared on a

field-by-field

or

area-by-area

basis, some of the Company’s estimates were greater than
    those of NSAI and some were less than the estimates of NSAI.
    When such differences do not exceed ten percent in the aggregate
    and NSAI is satisfied that the proved reserves and present value
    of such reserves discounted at ten percent are reasonable and
    that their audit objectives have been met, NSAI will issue a
    completed unqualified audit opinion. Remaining differences are
    not resolved due to the limited cost benefit of continuing such
    analyses by the Company and NSAI. At the conclusion of the audit
    process, it is NSAI’s opinion, as set forth in its audit
    letters, that Pioneer’s estimates of the Company’s
    proved oil and gas reserves and associated future net revenues
    are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in
    accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and
    evaluation principles.

The Company did not provide estimates of total proved oil and
    gas reserves during 2005, 2004 or 2003 to any federal authority
    or agency, other than the SEC. The Company’s reserve
    estimates do not include any probable or possible reserves.

Proved
    Reserves

The Company’s proved reserves totaled 986.7 MMBOE,
    1.0 billion BOE and 789.1 MMBOE at December 31,
    2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing
    $7.3 billion, $6.6 billion and $4.6 billion,
    respectively, of Standardized Measure. The Company’s proved
    reserves include field fuel which is gas consumed to operate
    field equipment (primarily compressors) prior to the gas being
    delivered to a sales point. The following table shows



the changes in the Company’s proved reserve volumes by

Production.

Production volumes include
    (a) 2,409 MBOE of field fuel and (b) 1,188 MBOE of
    production associated with certain divested assets being
    presented as discontinued operations.

Discoveries and extensions.

Discoveries
    and extensions are primarily the result of (a) drilling
    activity in the Raton Basin in the United States, Horseshoe
    Canyon and Chinchaga fields in Canada and the Neuquen Basin in
    Argentina and (b) the approval to begin development of the
    gas reserves, previously discovered, off the south coast of
    South Africa.

Acquisitions.

Acquisition volumes are
    primarily attributable to the (a) July 2005 announced
    completion of the acquisition of 70 MBOE of proved reserves
    in the Spraberry field and Gulf Coast area and (b) other
    smaller acquisitions.

Divestitures.

The divestitures are
    primarily attributable to (a) the sale of approximately
    28 MMBOE of proved reserves in the Spraberry and Hugoton
    fields through three VPPs, (b) the sale of approximately
    10 MMBOE of proved reserves in properties on the shelf of
    the Gulf of Mexico and East Texas and (c) the sale of
    approximately 10 MMBOE of proved reserves in the Martin
    Creek and Conroy Black areas of northeast British Columbia and
    the Lookout Butte area of southern Alberta.

Revisions.

The overall downward
    revisions are primarily attributable to (a) the recent
    drilling results in the deep gas reserves in the Neuquen Basin
    of Argentina which indicated that the gas reservoirs are more
    complex and compartmentalized than expected, and
    (b) additional production decline history on producing
    wells and unexpected drilling results in certain areas of the
    field in the Raton Basin in the United States where a number of
    wells drilled on the northern rim of the field during the second
    half of 2005 encountered less CBM reservoir than expected due to
    nonproductive volcanic intrusions into the coal interval. The
    downward revisions were offset by increased commodity prices
    that extended the economic life on various properties.

On a BOE basis, 62 percent of the Company’s total
    proved reserves at December 31, 2005 were proved developed
    reserves. Based on reserve information as of December 31,
    2005, and using the Company’s production information for
    the year then ended, the

reserve-to-production

ratio associated with the Company’s proved reserves was
    15 years on a BOE basis. The following table provides
    information regarding the Company’s proved reserves and
    average daily sales volumes by geographic area as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2005:

Description
    of Properties

As of December 31, 2005, the Company has production,
    development

and/or

exploration operations in the United States, Argentina, Canada,
    Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia.

United
    States

Approximately 78 percent of the Company’s proved
    reserves at December 31, 2005 is located in the Spraberry
    field in the Permian Basin area, the Hugoton and West Panhandle
    fields of the Mid-Continent area and the Raton field in the
    Rocky Mountain area. These fields generate substantial operating
    cash flow and the Spraberry and Raton fields have a large
    portfolio of low risk drilling opportunities. The cash flows
    generated from these fields provide funding for the
    Company’s other development and exploration activities both
    domestically and internationally. The Company has preliminarily
    budgeted approximately $900 million to $1.0 billion
    for exploration and development drilling expenditures for 2006.

Permian
    Basin

Spraberry field.

The Spraberry field
    was discovered in 1949 and encompasses eight counties in West
    Texas. The field is approximately 150 miles long and
    75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West
    Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas
    with an average energy content of 1,400 Btu. The oil and gas are
    produced primarily from three formations, the upper and lower
    Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from 6,700 feet
    to 9,200 feet. Recently, the Company has begun completing
    selected wells in the Wolfcamp formation at depths ranging from
    9,300 feet to 10,300 feet with successful results. The
    Company believes the area offers excellent opportunities to
    enhance oil and gas production because of the numerous
    undeveloped drilling locations, many of which are reflected in
    the Company’s proved undeveloped reserves, and the ability
    to contain operating expenses through economies of scale.

Mid-Continent

Hugoton field.

The Hugoton field in
    southwest Kansas is one of the largest producing gas fields in
    the continental United States. The gas is produced from the
    Chase and Council Grove formations at depths ranging from
    2,700 feet to 3,000 feet. The Company’s gas in
    the Hugoton field has an average energy content of 1,025 Btu.
    The Company’s Hugoton properties are located on
    approximately 257,000 gross acres (237,000 net acres),
    covering approximately 400 square miles. The Company has
    working interests in approximately 1,200 wells in the
    Hugoton field, about 1,000 of which it operates, and partial
    royalty interests in approximately 500 wells. The Company
    owns substantially all of the gathering and processing
    facilities, primarily the Satanta plant, that service its
    production from the Hugoton field. Such ownership allows the
    Company to control the production, gathering, processing and
    sale of its gas and NGL production.

The Company’s Hugoton operated wells are capable of
    producing approximately 74 MMcf of wet gas per day (i.e.,
    gas production at the wellhead before processing or field fuel
    use and before reduction for royalties), although actual
    production in the Hugoton field is limited by allowables set by
    state regulators. The Company estimates that it



and other major producers in the Hugoton field produced near
    allowable capacity during the year ended December 31, 2005.

West Panhandle field.

The West
    Panhandle properties are located in the panhandle region of
    Texas. These stable, long-lived reserves are attributable to the
    Red Cave, Brown Dolomite, Granite Wash and fractured Granite
    formations at depths no greater than 3,500 feet. The
    Company’s gas in the West Panhandle field has an average
    energy content of 1,300 Btu and is produced from approximately
    600 wells on more than 250,000 gross acres covering
    over 375 square miles. The Company controls
    100 percent of the wells, production equipment, gathering
    system and gas processing plant for the field.

Rocky
    Mountains

Raton field.

The Raton Basin properties
    are located in the southeast portion of Colorado. Exploration
    for CBM in the Raton Basin began in the late 1970s and continued
    through the late 1980s, with several companies drilling and
    testing more than 100 wells during this period. The absence
    of a pipeline to transport gas from the Raton Basin prevented
    full scale development until January 1995, when Colorado
    Interstate Gas Company completed the construction of the
    Picketwire lateral pipeline system. The Company’s gas in
    the Raton Basin has an average energy content of 1,000 Btu.
    Since the completion of the Picketwire lateral, production has
    continued to grow, resulting in expansion of the system’s
    capacity by its operator, the most recent expansion of which was
    in October 2005. The Company owns approximately
    385,000 gross acres in the center of the Raton Basin with
    current production from coal seams of the Vermejo and Raton
    formations.

Piceance/Uinta Basins.

The Piceance
    Basin is located in the central portion of western Colorado, and
    the Uinta Basin is located in the central portion of eastern
    Utah. The Company owns approximately 115,000 acres covering
    producing and prospective regions of the Piceance and Uinta
    Basins. Currently, production is established from various tight
    sandstone, coal and shale formations.

Sand Wash Basin.

The Sand Wash Basin is
    the site of a potential CBM project located north of the
    Company’s Piceance Basin properties. The Company holds a
    50 percent operated interest in 114,000 gross acres in the
    Lay Creek field. In 2006, the Company plans to (i) refrac
    the wells drilled by the previous owner in two existing pilots,
    specifically targeting coal seams to reduce water handling and
    (ii) drill an additional two or three pilot programs to
    evaluate the potential of the project.

Gulf of
    Mexico

Gulf of Mexico area.

In the Gulf of
    Mexico, the Company has focused on reserve and production growth
    by drilling its portfolio of shelf and deepwater development
    projects, high-impact, higher-risk shelf and deepwater
    exploration prospects and exploitation opportunities inherent in
    the properties the Company currently has producing on the shelf.

During September 2005, the Company announced its plans to pursue
    the divestment of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to reduce
    the exploration risk and production volatility that have been
    associated with these assets. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico bid
    process has been completed and the Company is currently in
    negotiations for the sale of these assets. No assurance can be
    given that a sale can be completed on terms acceptable to the
    Company. However, if successfully completed, such a divestiture
    would remove the deepwater Gulf of Mexico from the
    Company’s portfolio of oil and gas activities.

During 2005, the Company had five significant projects in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which are discussed below:

•

Canyon Express

— The Canyon Express
    project is a joint development of three deepwater Gulf of Mexico
    gas discoveries, including the Company’s Total E&P
    USA-operated Aconcagua field and Marathon-operated Camden Hills
    fields, where the Company holds 37.5 percent and
    33.3 percent working interests, respectively. The Company
    participated in the discovery of the Aconcagua gas field in 1999
    and later added Camden Hills to its portfolio to enhance its
    ownership in the project. The Canyon Express project was
    approved for development in June 2000 and reached first
    production in September 2002. The existing Aconcagua and Camden
    Hills wells are expected to reach the end of their productive
    lives in early



2006; therefore, the Company now anticipates that the system
    will be shut in once the recoverable reserves are fully produced
    until a rig becomes available to drill sidetrack wells in the
    Aconcagua field. The Company has been advised by the operator of
    the Canyon Express system that sidetrack operations are planned
    for the Aconcagua field in late 2006.

•

Falcon Corridor

— The Falcon Corridor
    project started with the Company’s Falcon field discovery
    during 2001, followed by the 2003 Harrier, Raptor and Tomahawk
    discoveries. The Company owns a 100 percent working
    interest in the Falcon Corridor discoveries and surrounding
    areas. First production from Falcon occurred in March 2003,
    followed by production from Harrier, Raptor and Tomahawk in
    2004. During 2005, the Harrier, Raptor and Tomahawk fields were
    fully depleted.

•

Devils Tower Area

— The Dominion-operated
    Devils Tower development project was sanctioned in 2001 as a
    spar development project with the owners leasing a spar from a
    third party for the life of the field. The spar has slots for
    eight dry tree wells and up to four subsea tie-back risers and
    is capable of handling 60 MBbls of oil per day and
    60 MMcf of gas per day. Devils Tower production operations
    were initiated in 2004 prior to being shut in due to Hurricane
    Ivan. Production was resumed in November 2004. In addition to
    the Devils Tower wells, three subsea tie-back wells in the
    Goldfinger and Triton satellite discoveries in the Devils Tower
    area were jointly tied back to the Devils Tower spar in November
    of 2005. The Company holds a 25 percent working interest in
    each of these projects.

Thunder Hawk

— The Murphy Exploration and
    Production Company-operated Thunder Hawk discovery in 2004
    encountered in excess of 300 feet of net oil pay in two
    high-quality reservoir zones in Mississippi Canyon
    Block 734. The third appraisal well was spudded during the
    fourth quarter of 2005 and plans to complete the drilling of the
    previously spudded second well, which was temporarily suspended
    due to weather. These wells are expected to be completed during
    the first half of 2006. The Company owns a 12.5 percent
    working interest in this discovery.

•

Clipper

— During the fourth quarter of
    2005, the Company announced a discovery on its Clipper prospect
    in the Green Canyon Block 299. The Company plans additional
    drilling during 2006 to further delineate the field. The Company
    operates the block with a 55 percent working interest.

Onshore
    Gulf Coast

South Texas.

The Company has focused
    its drilling efforts in this area on the Pawnee field in the
    Edwards Reef trend in South Texas. The Edwards Reef trend is a
    tight gas limestone reservoir characterized by narrow bands of
    dry gas fields extending over 250 miles. In addition to the
    Pawnee field, the Company has operations in the SW Kenedy and
    Washburn fields of the Edwards Reef trend and a growing acreage
    position with over 160,000 acres acquired during the past
    year. Production depths in the trend range from 9,500 feet
    to 14,000 feet, from which over 1 trillion cubic feet
    of gas has been produced by the oil and gas industry. The
    Company drilled its first successful exploration well in the
    recently acquired acreage in the Edwards Reef trend in late 2005
    and is currently producing approximately 1.3 MMcf of gas
    per day from the discovery. Pioneer’s current plans include
    drilling at least 20 wells in the Edwards Reef trend during
    2006, leveraging the Company’s horizontal drilling
    expertise.

Northern Louisiana and Mississippi.

The
    Company has acquired significant acreage in Northern Louisiana
    and Mississippi. During 2006, the Company is planning
    exploratory tests in the Hosston/Cotton Valley trend in Northern
    Louisiana and a Norphlet prospect in Mississippi.

Alaska

North Slope area.

During 2002, the
    Company acquired a 70 percent working interest and
    operatorship in ten state leases on Alaska’s North Slope.
    Associated therewith, the Company drilled three exploratory
    wells during 2003 to test a possible extension of the productive
    sands in the Kuparuk River field in the shallow waters offshore.
    Although all three of the wells found the sands filled with oil,
    they were too thin to be considered commercial on a stand-alone
    basis. However, the wells also encountered thick sections of
    oil-bearing Jurassic-aged sands, and the first well flowed at a
    rate of approximately 1,300 Bbls per day (“BPD”).
    In January 2004, the Company farmed-into a large acreage block
    to the southwest of the Company’s discovery. In the fourth
    quarter of 2004, Pioneer completed



an extensive technical and economic evaluation of the resource
    potential within this area. As a result of this evaluation, the
    Company performed front-end engineering and permitting
    activities during 2005 to further define the scope of the
    project. In February 2006, the Company announced that it has
    approved and is commencing the development of the Oooguruk field
    in the project area. Following the construction of a gravel
    drilling and production site in 2006, installation of a subsea
    flowline and facilities are planned for 2007 to carry produced
    liquids to existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk
    River Unit. Between 2007 and 2009, Pioneer plans to drill
    approximately 40 horizontal wells in the Oooguruk field.
    Total gross capital invested, including projected drilling and
    facility costs, is expected to range from $450 million to
    $525 million. First production from these wells is expected
    to begin in 2008.

During the first quarter of 2006, Pioneer anticipates drilling
    two exploration wells as operator, one with a 50 percent
    working interest in the Storms area, and a second, under a
    farm-in agreement with ConocoPhillips, with a 90 percent
    working interest on the Cronus prospect. Under another farm-in
    agreement with ConocoPhillips, Pioneer plans to participate with
    a 32.5 percent working interest in a third exploration well
    to be drilled on ConocoPhillips’ Antigua prospect.

Cosmopolitan.

During 2005, Pioneer
    announced that it entered into an agreement on the Cosmopolitan
    Unit in the Cook Inlet. Under this agreement, Pioneer earned a
    ten percent working interest in the unit from ConocoPhillips
    through a disproportionate spending arrangement for a

3-D

seismic
    program undertaken during the fourth quarter of 2005. Pursuant
    to this agreement, Pioneer has the option to acquire an
    additional 40 percent interest in the Cosmopolitan Unit any
    time prior to June 1, 2006. Upon evaluation of the results
    of the aforementioned

3-D

seismic
    program, Pioneer will determine whether or not to exercise this
    option.

International

The Company’s international operations are located in the
    Neuquen and Austral Basins areas of Argentina, the Chinchaga and
    Horseshoe Canyon areas of Canada, the Sable oil field offshore
    South Africa and in southern Tunisia. Additionally, the Company
    has other development and exploration activities in the shallow
    waters offshore South Africa and oil development and exploration
    activities in Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Tunisia. As of
    December 31, 2005, approximately ten percent, two percent
    and two percent of the Company’s proved reserves were
    located in Argentina, Canada and Africa, respectively.

Argentina.

The Company’s operated
    production in Argentina is concentrated in the Neuquen Basin,
    which is located about 925 miles southwest of Buenos Aires
    and to the east of the Andes Mountains. Oil and gas are produced
    primarily from the Al Norte de la Dorsal, the Al Sur de la
    Dorsal, the Dadin, the Loma Negra, the Dos Hermanas, the
    Anticlinal Campamento and the Estación Fernández Oro
    blocks, in each of which the Company has a 100 percent
    working interest. Most of the gas produced from these blocks is
    processed in the Company’s Loma Negra gas processing plant.
    The Company operates the Meseta Sirven block located in the
    southern part of the San Jorge basin in Santa Cruz
    Province, approximately 1,200 miles south of Buenos Aires.
    The production from this block, in which the Company has a
    100 percent working interest, is primarily oil. The Company
    also operates and has a 50 percent working interest in the
    Lago Fuego field, which is located in Tierra del Fuego, an
    island in the extreme southern portion of Argentina,
    approximately 1,500 miles south of Buenos Aires.

Most of the Company’s nonoperated production in Argentina
    is located in Tierra del Fuego, the most southern province in
    Argentina, where oil, gas and NGLs are produced from six
    separate fields in which the Company has a 35 percent
    working interest. The Company also has a 14.4 percent
    working interest in the Confluencia field which is located in
    the Neuquen Basin.

During September 2005, the Company announced that it would
    pursue the sale of its nonoperated position in Tierra del Fuego.
    During the Tierra del Fuego sales process, several prospective
    buyers indicated that they could enhance their value for a
    transaction in Argentina if it included all of Pioneer’s
    properties. The Company decided that if a buyer presented an
    attractive offer for all of the Argentine assets, that it would
    consider exiting Argentina. On January 17, 2006, the
    Company announced signing an agreement with Apache Corporation
    to sell all of the Company’s interests in Argentina for
    $675 million (subject to normal closing adjustments). The
    transaction is expected to close during the latter part of the
    first quarter or in early April of 2006.

Canada.

The Company’s Canadian
    producing properties are located primarily in Alberta and
    British Columbia, Canada. In May 2005, the Company sold its
    ownership interests in the Martin Creek and Conroy Black areas
    of northeast British Columbia and the Lookout Butte area of
    southern Alberta for net proceeds of $197.2 million. The
    Company continues to exploit lower risk opportunities identified
    in the Chinchaga field core area of northeast British Columbia.
    The Company also initiated significant drilling, pipeline and
    facility activities in south-central Alberta targeting Horseshoe
    Canyon CBM potential on the existing land base in the greater
    Drumheller area.

Production from the Chinchaga area of northeast British Columbia
    is relatively dry gas from formation depths averaging
    3,400 feet. The greater Drumheller area in south-central
    Alberta produces CBM gas, CBM condensate and minor oil from
    Cretaceous to Devonian formations at depths ranging from 400 to
    6,500 feet. The Company has CBM gas production currently
    from the Horseshoe Canyon coal and further exploitation drilling
    will occur throughout the area in 2006.



Equatorial Guinea.

The Company owns a
    50 percent working interest in Block H offshore
    Equatorial Guinea. The Company has identified several prospects
    on the block that are being evaluated for future drilling, one
    of which is expected to be drilled during 2006 or 2007.

Nigeria.

A partially-owned subsidiary
    of the Company joined Oranto Petroleum and Orandi Petroleum in
    an existing production sharing contract on Block 320 in
    deepwater Nigeria gaining exploration rights from the Nigerian
    National Petroleum Corporation. The subsidiary, which holds a
    51 percent interest in Block 320, is owned
    59 percent by the Company and 41 percent by an
    unaffiliated third party. The Company acquired

3-D

seismic
    data in 2005, is currently processing the seismic and plans to
    drill the first well in Block 320 during 2007.

The Company owns a 26 percent working interest in
    Devon-operated Block 256 offshore Nigeria. The Company
    participated in an unsuccessful exploratory well on this block
    during 2005 and is participating in a second exploration well
    that spudded during January 2006. The timing of a third
    exploration well planned for the block has not been determined.

The Company had previously announced it was awarded, through a
    consortium, rights to acreage in Blocks 2 and 3 of the
    Joint Development Zone in offshore Nigeria, São Tomé
    and Príncipe subject to negotiating acceptable joint
    operating and production sharing agreements. On February 7,
    2006, the Company announced that it was withdrawing from
    participation in both blocks.

South Africa.

The Company has
    agreements to explore for oil and gas offshore South Africa
    covering over five million acres along the southern coast in
    water depths generally less than 650 feet. The Sable oil
    field began producing in August 2003 and the majority of the gas
    from the field has been reinjected. The Company has a
    40 percent working interest in the Sable field.

In December 2005, the Company announced the final approvals with
    its partner in the South Coast Gas project. Pioneer has a
    45 percent working interest in the project. The project
    will include subsea tie-back of gas from the Sable field and six
    additional gas accumulations to the existing production
    facilities on the F-A platform for transportation via existing
    pipelines to a

gas-to-liquids

(“GTL”) plant. The Company has signed a contract for
    the sale of its share of gas and condensate to the GTL plant.
    Production is expected to begin during the second half of 2007
    and increase to an average of approximately 100 MMcf per
    day of gas and 3,000 BPD of condensate over the initial
    phase of the project through 2012. Development drilling related
    to the project is expected to commence in the first quarter of
    2006.

Tunisia.

The Company’s Tunisian
    permits can be separated into three categories: (i) three
    permits covering 2.9 million acres which the Company
    operates with an average 55 percent working interest,
    (ii) the Anadarko-operated Anaguid and Jenein Nord permits
    covering over 1.5 million acres in which the Company has a
    45 percent working interest and (iii) the ENI-operated
    Adam Concession and Borj El Khadra permit covering approximately
    212,000 acres and 970,000 acres, respectively, in
    which the Company has a 20 percent and 40 percent
    working interest, respectively.  Production from the Adam
    Concession began in May 2003. All permits are onshore southern
    Tunisia.

In 2005, the Company conducted an extended production test of
    one of the two existing Anaguid Block exploration wells and
    drilled an offset appraisal well to the other exploration well.
    The results of the extended production test were unfavorable.
    However, the appraisal well offsetting the second discovery
    encountered gas and condensate in a similar horizon to the
    initial well. The Company is currently reviewing data from the
    appraisal well to determine whether development of the area is
    economical.

Selected
    Oil and Gas Information

The following tables set forth selected oil and gas information
    from continuing operations for the Company as of and for each of
    the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Because
    of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling
    activities and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the
    historical information presented below should not be interpreted
    as being indicative of future results.

Production, price and cost data.

The following
    tables set forth production, price and cost data with respect to
    the Company’s properties for 2005, 2004 and 2003. These
    amounts represent the Company’s historical results from



continuing operations without making pro forma adjustments for
    any acquisitions, divestitures or drilling activity that
    occurred during the respective years. The production amounts
    will not agree to the reserve volume tables in the
    “Unaudited Supplementary Information” section included
    in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” due to field fuel volumes and production from
    discontinued operations being included in the reserve volume
    tables.

The Company’s lower average prices received for its
    Argentine commodities, as compared to the prices received in
    other countries, are due to price limitations imposed by the
    Argentine government in an effort to keep fuel and energy prices
    for Argentine consumers at pre-devaluation levels. These
    limitations have kept the prices received for oil and gas sales
    in Argentina well below world market levels. Beginning in 2004,
    the government mandated certain scheduled gas price increases
    through mid-2005. Those specific increases occurred as
    scheduled, but no specific predictions can be made about the
    future of oil or gas prices in Argentina. See “Qualitative
    Disclosures” in “Item 7A. Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional
    discussion of Argentine foreign currency, operations and price
    risk.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Strategic
    Initiatives

During September 2005, the Company announced that the Board
    approved the following strategic initiatives to enhance
    shareholder value and investment returns:

•

Approval of a $1 billion share repurchase program,
    $650 million of which was immediately initiated and
    substantially completed during 2005. The remaining
    $350 million is subject to the completion of the planned
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine divestments discussed
    below.

•

A plan to divest the Company’s assets in the Tierra del
    Fuego area in southern Argentina. The plan was later broadened
    to include entertaining offers for a complete sale of all of the
    Company’s Argentine assets. During January 2006, Pioneer
    entered into an agreement to sell its assets in Argentina for
    $675 million.

•

A plan to divest the Company’s assets in the deepwater Gulf
    of Mexico. Bids to purchase the properties were received in
    January 2006 and the Company is currently engaged in
    negotiations for the sale of these assets. No assurance can be
    given that a sale can be completed on terms acceptable to the
    Company.

The implementation of the Board’s strategic initiatives is
    allowing Pioneer to (i) allocate and focus its investment
    capital more heavily towards predictable oil and gas basins in
    North America that have delivered relatively strong and
    consistent growth and (ii) lower its risk profile by
    expanding North American unconventional resource investments
    while reducing exploration expenditures.

The divestiture of the Company’s Argentine oil and gas
    assets will allow the Company to leverage the current commodity
    price environment to monetize and exit operations in an area
    that has become characterized by lower operating margins,
    government-controlled pricing and modest production growth
    opportunities. The divestiture of the Company’s deepwater
    Gulf of Mexico assets, if successful, will also allow the
    Company to monetize and exit operations in an area that is
    characterized by escalating drilling and operating costs and
    relatively high exploration risk and production volatility.

Financial
    and Operating Performance

Pioneer’s financial and operating performance for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 included the following highlights:

•

Average daily sales volumes on a BOE basis decreased one percent
    in 2005 as compared to 2004.

•

Oil and gas revenues increased 25 percent in 2005 as
    compared to 2004 primarily as a result of increases in worldwide
    oil and Argentine and North American gas prices.

•

Interest and other income increased by $83.0 million in
    2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to $73.6 million of
    business interruption insurance claims related to (a) the
    Hurricane Ivan disruptions and (b) the Fain gas plant fire.

•

Other expense increased by $79.1 million in 2005 as
    compared to 2004, primarily due to increases of
    $50.5 million and $26.0 million in losses associated
    with commodity hedge ineffectiveness and debt extinguishments,
    respectively.

•

Income from continuing operations before income taxes and
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased by
    54 percent to $715.5 million in 2005 from
    $463.1 million in 2004.

•

Net income increased to $534.6 million ($3.80 per
    diluted share) for 2005, as compared to $312.9 million
    ($2.46 per diluted share) for 2004.

•

The Company recognized income from discontinued operations of
    $110.8 million ($.78 per diluted share) during 2005
    attributable to the sale of certain Gulf of Mexico shelf and
    Canadian properties.

•

Outstanding debt decreased by $327.5 million, or
    14 percent, as of December 31, 2005 as compared to
    debt outstanding as of December 31, 2004.

Current
    Events

Argentina divestiture.

During
    September 2005, the Company announced that it would pursue
    the sale of its nonoperated assets in Tierra del Fuego. During
    the Tierra del Fuego sales process, several prospective buyers
    indicated that they could enhance their value for a transaction
    in Argentina if it included all of Pioneer’s assets. The
    Company decided that if a buyer presented an attractive offer
    for all of the Argentine assets, that it would consider exiting
    Argentina. On January 17, 2006, the Company announced
    signing an agreement with Apache Corporation to sell all of the
    Company’s interests in Argentina for $675 million
    (subject to normal closing adjustments). The transaction is
    expected to close during the latter part of the first quarter or
    in early April of 2006. The results of operations from these
    assets will be reflected as discontinued operations in the
    Company’s future financial statements if the sale is closed.

Oooguruk development.

In February 2006,
    the Company announced that it has approved and is commencing the
    development of the Oooguruk field in shallow waters off the
    North Slope of Alaska. The Company has a 70 percent working
    interest in the field. Following the construction of a gravel
    drilling and production site during the 2006, a subsea flowline
    and facilities will be installed during 2007 to carry produced
    liquids to existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk
    River Unit. Between 2007 and 2009, Pioneer plans to drill
    approximately 40 horizontal wells in the Oooguruk field. Total
    gross capital invested, including projected drilling and
    facility costs, is expected to range from $450 million to
    $525 million. First production from these wells is expected
    to begin in 2008.

South Coast Gas project.

In December
    2005, the Company announced the final approvals with its partner
    in the South Coast Gas project. Pioneer has a 45 percent
    working interest in the project. The project will include subsea
    tie-back of gas from the Sable field and six additional gas
    accumulations to the existing production facilities on the F-A
    platform for transportation via existing pipelines to a GTL
    plant. The Company has signed a contract for the sale of its
    share of gas and condensate to the GTL plant. Production is
    expected to begin during the second half of 2007 and increase to
    an average of approximately 100 MMcf per day of gas and
    3,000 Bbls per day of condensate over the initial phase of the
    project through 2012. Development drilling related to the
    project is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2006.

Deepwater Gulf of Mexico
    divestiture.

During September 2005, the
    Company announced its plans to pursue the divestment of its
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to reduce the exploration risk
    and production volatility that have been associated with these
    properties. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico bid process has been
    completed and the Company is currently engaged in negotiations
    for the sale of these assets. No assurance can be given that a
    sale can be completed on terms acceptable to the Company. The
    results of operations from these assets will be reflected as
    discontinued operations in the Company’s future financial
    statements if the divestiture is completed.

Acquisitions

Evergreen merger.

On September 28,
    2004, Pioneer completed a merger with Evergreen. Pioneer
    acquired the common stock of Evergreen for a total purchase
    price of approximately $1.8 billion, which was comprised of
    cash and Pioneer common stock. At the merger date,
    Evergreen’s proved reserves were approximately
    262 MMBOE. Evergreen was primarily engaged in the
    production, development, exploration and acquisition of North
    American unconventional gas and was one of the leading
    developers of CBM reserves in the United States.
    Evergreen’s operations were principally focused on
    developing and expanding its CBM gas field located in the Raton
    Basin in southern Colorado. Evergreen also had operations in the
    Piceance Basin in western Colorado, the Uinta Basin in eastern
    Utah and the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.

Permian Basin and Onshore Gulf Coast
    areas.

In July 2005, the Company completed
    the purchase of approximately 70 MMBOE of substantially
    undeveloped proved oil reserves in the United States core areas
    of the Permian Basin and South Texas for $176.9 million.
    The assets acquired provide an estimated 800 undrilled well
    locations.



Divestitures

Volumetric production payments.

During
    January 2005, the Company sold two percent of its total proved
    reserves, or 20.5 MMBOE of proved reserves in the Hugoton
    and Spraberry fields, by means of two VPPs for net proceeds of
    $592.3 million, including the assignment of the
    Company’s obligations under certain derivative hedge
    agreements.

During April 2005, the Company sold less than one percent of its
    total proved reserves, or 7.3 MMBOE of proved reserves in
    the Spraberry field, by means of a VPP for net proceeds of
    $300.3 million, including the value attributable to certain
    derivative hedge agreements assigned to the buyer of the April
    VPP.

The Company’s VPPs represent limited-term overriding
    royalty interests in oil and gas reserves which:
    (i) entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes
    over a period of time from specific lease interests;
    (ii) are free and clear of all associated future production
    costs and capital expenditures; (iii) are nonrecourse to
    the Company (i.e., the purchaser’s only recourse is to the
    assets acquired); (iv) transfers title of the assets to the
    purchaser and (v) allows the Company to retain the assets
    after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered.

Canada and Gulf of Mexico.

During May
    2005, the Company sold all of its interests in the Martin Creek
    and Conroy Black areas of northeast British Columbia and the
    Lookout Butte area of southern Alberta for net proceeds of
    $197.2 million, resulting in a gain of $138.3 million.
    During August 2005, the Company sold all of its interests in
    certain oil and gas properties on the shelf of the Gulf of
    Mexico for net proceeds of $59.1 million, resulting in a
    gain of $27.7 million. The historic results of operations
    of these properties have been removed from the Company’s
    reported income from continuing operations and are included,
    together with the gains from the divestitures, in income from
    discontinuing operations, net of taxes.

Gabon divestiture.

In October 2005, the
    Company closed the sale of the shares in a Gabonese subsidiary
    that owns the interest in the Olowi block for $47.9 million
    of net proceeds. A gain was recognized during the fourth quarter
    of 2005 of $47.5 million with no associated income tax
    effect either in Gabon or the United States. In addition,
    Pioneer retains the potential, under certain circumstances, to
    receive additional payments for production from deeper
    reservoirs discovered on the block.

    Outlook and Activities

Commodity prices.

World oil prices
    increased during the year ended December 31, 2005 in
    response to continued demand growth in Asian economies,
    hurricane disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico, political unrest
    and supply disruptions in Middle East and Venezuela and other
    supply and demand factors. North American gas prices also
    increased during 2005 in response to continued strong demand
    fundamentals while supply uncertainties still remain. The
    Company’s outlook for 2006 commodity prices continues to be
    cautiously optimistic. Significant factors that will impact 2006
    commodity prices include developments in Iraq, Iran and other
    Middle East countries, the extent to which members of the OPEC
    and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply
    through export quotas and variations in key North American gas
    supply and demand indicators. Pioneer will continue to
    strategically hedge oil and gas price risk to mitigate the
    impact of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues.

See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding
    the Company’s commodity hedge positions at
    December 31, 2005. Also see “Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”
    for disclosures about the Company’s commodity related
    derivative financial instruments.

Preliminary 2006 capital budget.

In
    certain of its prior Annual Reports on

Form 10-K,

the Company has provided detailed information on its next year
    capital allocation and first quarter guidance with respect to
    production costs and expenses. As a result of the uncertainty
    surrounding the Company’s proposed divestitures of its
    Argentine and deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets, the Company is
    presently unable to provide similar information for 2006.

The Company has prepared a preliminary capital budget that does
    not include capital for its Argentine assets but does include
    limited capital for the Company’s deepwater Gulf of Mexico
    assets. The preliminary budget is approximately
    $1.3 billion and includes plans to drill 1,000 to 1,100
    wells. The Company’s preliminary 2006 capital



budget is heavily focused on development and extension drilling,
    including funding for the recently sanctioned Oooguruk and South
    Coast gas projects. Less than 20 percent of the preliminary
    2006 capital budget is for exploration activities. The
    Company’s final allocation of capital during 2006 is
    subject to the approval of the Board and is dependent on the
    outcome of the planned divestitures. Accordingly, the final
    budget may differ materially from the preliminary budget.

Results
    of Operations

Oil and gas revenues.

Revenues from oil
    and gas operations totaled $2.2 billion, $1.8 billion
    and $1.2 billion during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
    The revenue increase during 2005, as compared to 2004, was due
    to an 18 percent increase in oil prices, a 26 percent
    increase in NGL prices and a 32 percent increase in gas
    prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges,
    partially offset by a one percent decrease in average daily BOE
    sales volumes. The revenue increase from 2003 to 2004 was due to
    a 22 percent increase in average daily BOE sales volumes, a
    24 percent increase in oil prices, a 32 percent
    increase in NGL prices and a 14 percent increase in gas
    prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges.

The following table provides average daily sales volumes from
    continuing operations, by geographic area and in total, for
    2005, 2004 and 2003:

Per BOE average daily production for 2005, as compared to 2004,
    increased by seven percent in Argentina and by 42 percent
    in Canada, while average daily sales volumes decreased by three
    percent in the United States and by 14 percent in Africa.



Average daily sales volumes from continuing operations in the
    United States was slightly lower in 2005 as compared to 2004
    principally due to  declining production in the Gulf of Mexico,
    asset divestitures and downtime at the Fain gas plant offset by
    a full year of production from the properties acquired in the
    Evergreen merger.

Argentine average daily sales volumes increased as a result of
    successful development drilling and increased market demand
    during Argentina’s summer season. The Company has increased
    its level of capital expenditures in Argentina as the stability
    of the Argentine peso and the general economic outlook for
    Argentina has improved and gas prices have increased.

Canadian average daily sales volumes from continuing operations
    increased due to new production from Canadian properties
    acquired in the Evergreen merger and production from new wells
    drilled during 2005.

Production is down in South Africa due to normal production
    declines and timing of oil shipments, partially offset by
    continued growth in Tunisia production.

Per BOE average daily production for 2004, as compared to 2003,
    increased by 16 percent in the United States, increased by
    18 percent in Argentina, decreased by four percent in
    Canada and the Company realized first production from South
    Africa and Tunisia during 2003. The increased production was
    principally attributable to (i) a full year of production
    from the Falcon area, (ii) new production being initiated
    from the Harrier, Raptor and Tomahawk fields in the Falcon area
    and at Devils Tower, (iii) fourth quarter production added
    from the Evergreen merger and (iv) oil sales having first
    been realized from the Company’s Tunisian and South African
    oil projects during August and October of 2003, respectively.
    Argentine oil and gas sales volumes increased during 2004
    primarily due to incremental production volumes that resulted
    from the Company’s expanded drilling program and higher oil
    and gas demand during the summer season.

Hedging activities.

The oil and gas
    prices that the Company reports are based on the market price
    received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the
    Company’s cash flow hedging activities. The Company
    utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to
    (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the
    commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support
    the Company’s annual capital budgeting and expenditure
    plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with
    certain capital projects. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
    Company’s commodity price hedges decreased oil and gas
    revenues from continuing operations by $420.4 million,
    $211.9 million and $110.7 million, respectively. The
    effective portions of changes in the fair values of the



Company’s commodity price hedges are deferred as increases
    or decreases to stockholders’ equity until the underlying
    hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the
    effective portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to
    the Company’s reported stockholders’ equity until the
    hedge derivative matures or is terminated. See Note J of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” for information concerning the impact to oil and gas
    revenues during 2005, 2004 and 2003 from the Company’s
    hedging activities, the Company’s open hedge positions at
    December 31, 2005 and descriptions of the Company’s
    hedge commodity derivatives. Also see “Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”
    for additional disclosures about the Company’s commodity
    related derivative financial instruments.

Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company reduced its
    oil and gas hedge positions by terminating the following swap
    and collar contracts: (i) 2,000 BPD of March through
    December 2006 oil swap contracts with a fixed price of $26.29
    per Bbl; 1,000 BPD of calendar 2007 oil swap contracts with a
    fixed price of $31.00 per Bbl; 2,000 BPD of calendar 2008 oil
    swap contracts with a fixed price of $30.00 per Bbl; 2,000 BPD
    of March through December 2006 oil collar contracts having a
    floor price of $50.00 per Bbl and a ceiling price of $96.25 per
    Bbl; 2,500 BPD of calendar 2007 oil collar contracts having a
    floor price of $50.00 and a ceiling price of $91.18 per Bbl and
    (ii) 65,000 MMBtu per day of April through December 2006
    gas collar contracts with a weighted average floor price per
    MMBtu of $6.74 and a weighted average ceiling price per MMBtu of
    $14.01. The aggregate value of the terminated oil and gas hedge
    contracts was a liability of $59.4 million on the dates of
    termination.

Argentina commodity prices.

During
    2002, the Argentine government implemented a 20 percent tax
    on oil exports. In 2003, the Company exported approximately five
    percent of its Argentine oil production. Associated therewith,
    the Company incurred oil export taxes of $1.2 million for
    2003. During 2004 and 2005, the Company did not export any of
    its Argentine oil production. The export tax has also had the
    effect of decreasing internal Argentine oil revenues (not only
    export revenues) by the taxes levied. The U.S. dollar
    equivalent value for domestic Argentine oil sales (now paid in
    pesos) has generally moved toward parity with the
    U.S. dollar-denominated export values, net of the export
    tax. The adverse impact of this tax has been partially offset by
    the net cost savings resulting from the devaluation of the peso
    on peso-denominated costs.

In January 2003, at the Argentine government’s request, oil
    producers and refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for certain
    domestic sales at $28.50 per Bbl, which remained in effect
    through April 2004. The producers and refiners further agreed
    that the difference between the actual price and the capped
    price would be payable once actual prices fall below the $28.50
    cap. Subsequently the terms were modified such that while the
    $28.50 per Bbl payable cap was in place, the refiners would
    have no obligation to pay producers for sales values that
    exceeded $36.00 per Bbl. Initially, the refiners and
    producers also agreed to discount U.S. dollar-denominated
    oil prices at 90 percent prior to converting to pesos at
    the current exchange rate for the purpose of invoicing and
    settling oil sales to Argentine refiners. In May 2004, refiners
    and producers changed the discount percentage from
    90 percent for all price levels to 86 percent if West
    Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) was equal to or less than
    $36 per Bbl and 80 percent if WTI exceeded
    $36 per Bbl. All the oil prices are adjusted for normal
    quality differentials prior to applying the discount.

In 2004, it appeared probable that the price of world oil would
    remain above the $28.50 cap for the foreseeable future. Given
    the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when Argentine
    producers could expect to collect balances outstanding from
    refiners, the Company ceased recognizing revenue and began
    recording any excess between the actual sales price pursuant to
    its oil sales contracts with Argentine refiners that were
    subject to the price stabilization agreement and the $28.50
    price cap as deferred revenue in the balance sheet. The decision
    by Argentine oil producers and refiners to not renew the price
    stability agreement beyond April 30, 2004 does not
    terminate the obligation of refiners to reimburse producers for
    balances that accumulated from January 2003 through April 2004,
    if and when the price of WTI falls below $28.50.

In May 2004, the Argentine government increased the export tax
    from 20 percent to 25 percent. This tax is applied on
    the sales value after the tax, thus, the net effect of the
    20 percent and 25 percent rates is 16.7 percent
    and 20 percent, respectively. In August 2004, the Argentine
    government further increased the export tax rates for oil
    exports. The export tax now escalates from the current
    25 percent (20 percent effective rate) to a maximum
    rate of 45 percent (31 percent effective rate) of the
    realized value for exported Bbls as WTI prices per Bbl increase
    from



less than $32.00 to $45.00 and above. The export tax is not
    deducted in the calculation of royalty payments and expires in
    February 2007. Given the number of governmental changes during
    2005 affecting the realized price the Company receives for its
    oil sales, no specific predictions can be made about the future
    of oil prices in Argentina. However, in the short term, the
    Company expects Argentine oil realizations to be less than oil
    realizations in the United States.

As a result of the economic emergency law enacted by the
    Argentine government in January 2002, the Company’s gas
    prices, expressed in U.S. dollars, have also fallen in
    proportion to the devaluation of the Argentine peso since the
    end of 2001 due to the pesofication of contracts and freezing of
    gas prices at the wellhead required by that law. As a baseline,
    the Company’s 2001 realized Argentine gas price was
    $1.31 per Mcf as compared to $.88, $.66 and $.56 in 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively.

The unfavorable gas price has acted to discourage gas
    development activities and increased gas demand. Without
    development of gas reserves in Argentina, supplies of gas in the
    country have declined, while demand for gas has been increasing
    due to the resurgence of the Argentine economy and the higher
    cost of alternative fuels. Briefly during 2004, gas exports to
    Chile were curtailed at the direction of the Argentine
    government. Argentina has also entered into an agreement to
    import gas from Bolivia at prices starting at approximately
    $2.00 per Mcf (at the border), including transportation
    costs. In May 2004, pursuant to a decree, the Argentine
    government approved measures to permit producers to renegotiate
    gas sales contracts, excluding those that could affect small
    residential customers, in accordance with scheduled price
    increases specified in the decree. The wellhead prices in the
    decree increased from a 2004 range of $.61 to $.78 per Mcf
    to a range of $.87 to $1.04 per Mcf after July 1,
    2005, depending on the region where the gas is produced. No
    further gas price increases beyond July 2005 have occurred.
    Other than an expectation that gas prices will be permitted to
    increase gradually over time, as has already been demonstrated
    by the governing authorities, no specific predictions can be
    made about the future of gas prices in Argentina. However, the
    Company expects Argentine gas realizations to be less than gas
    realizations in the United States.

See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk” for further discussion of commodity
    prices in Argentina.

Interest and other income.

The Company
    recorded interest and other income totaling $97.1 million,
    $14.1 million and $12.3 during 2005, 2004 and 2003,
    respectively. The increase in interest and other income during
    2005, as compared to 2004, is primarily attributable to the
    recognition of $73.6 million in business interruption
    insurance claims, of which $59.4 million relates to
    Hurricane Ivan and $14.2 million to the Fain plant fire.
    See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding
    interest and other income.

Gain on disposition of assets.

The
    Company recorded gains on disposition of assets of
    $60.5 million, $39,000 and $1.3 million during 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively.

In 2005, the gain is primarily related to (a) the sale of
    the stock of a subsidiary that owned the interest in the Olowi
    block in Gabon, which resulted in a $47.5 million gain and
    (b) a $14 million insurance settlement on the
    Company’s East Cameron facility that was destroyed by
    Hurricane Rita, resulting in a $9.7 million gain.

During 2005 the Company also recognized gains on the sale of
    certain assets in Canada and the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico of
    approximately $166.1 million. However, pursuant to
    SFAS 144 the gain and the results of operations from these
    assets have been reclassified to discontinued operations.

The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2005, 2004
    and 2003 were used, together with net cash flows provided by
    operating activities, to fund additions to oil and gas
    properties and to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See
    Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding
    asset divestitures.

Oil and gas production costs.

The
    Company recorded production costs of $449.3 million,
    $316.1 million and $228.2 million during 2005, 2004
    and 2003, respectively. In general, lease operating expenses and
    workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas
    production costs over which the Company has management control,
    while production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related
    to commodity price changes. Total production costs per BOE
    increased during 2005 by 44 percent as compared to 2004
    primarily due to (i) an increase



in production and ad valorem taxes as a result of higher
    commodity prices, (ii) higher Canadian gas transportation
    fees, (iii) the retention of operating costs related to VPP
    volumes sold (approximately $.19 per BOE, during 2005),
    (iv) new production added from the Evergreen merger which
    are relatively higher per BOE operating cost properties, (v)
    decreased production from the lower per BOE production cost
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets and (v) increases in
    equipment and service costs associated with rising commodity
    prices.

Total production costs per BOE increased during 2004 by
    13 percent as compared to 2003. The increase in total
    production costs per BOE during 2004 as compared to 2003 was
    primarily attributable to increases in production volumes and a
    greater proportion of those volumes coming from the Sable oil
    field in South Africa, the Devils Tower oil and gas field in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, the new
    production added with the Evergreen merger which are higher
    operating cost properties.

The following tables provide the components of the
    Company’s total production costs per BOE from continuing
    operations and total production costs per BOE from continuing
    operations by geographic area for 2005, 2004 and 2003:

Depletion, depreciation and amortization
    expense.

The Company’s total depletion,
    depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) expense was
    $8.86, $8.56 and $7.07 per BOE for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
    respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of
    DD&A expense, was $8.53, $8.38 and $6.89 per BOE during
    2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, the increase in
    per BOE depletion expense was primarily due to relatively higher
    per BOE cost basis Rocky Mountain area production acquired in
    the Evergreen merger and a higher depletion rate for the Hugoton
    and Spraberry fields as a result of the VPP volumes sold,
    partially offset by lower production from higher cost-basis Gulf
    of Mexico production. Additionally, the Company’s depletion
    expense per BOE (i) increased in Argentina due to downward
    reserve revisions associated with negative well performance and
    drilling results in its deep gas play in the Neuquen basin,
    (ii) increased in Tunisia due to the Company’s proved
    reserves being reduced as a result of the Company’s
    interest in the Adam block being reduced to 20 percent from
    28 percent in accordance with the terms of the concession
    and (iii) decreased in South Africa as a result of upward
    reserve revisions attributable to better well performance.

During 2004, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was due
    to a greater proportion of the Company’s production being
    derived from higher cost-basis deepwater Gulf of Mexico and
    South African developments and downward revisions to proved
    reserves in Canada in 2003.

Impairment of oil and gas
    properties.

The Company reviews its
    long-lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas
    properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. During
    2005 and 2004, the Company recognized a noncash impairment
    charge of $.6 million and $39.7 million, respectively,
    to reduce the carrying value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets
    as development of the discovery was canceled. See “Critical
    Accounting Estimates” below and Notes B and S of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” for additional information pertaining to the
    Company’s accounting policies regarding assessments of
    impairment and the Gabonese Olowi field impairment, respectively.

Significant components of the Company’s dry hole expense
    during 2005 included $21.2 related to certain suspended Alaskan
    well costs, $16.7 million associated with an unsuccessful
    well in the Falcon Corridor, $9.5 million associated with
    an unsuccessful Nigerian well, $3.5 million attributable to
    an unsuccessful well on the Company’s El Hamra permit in
    Tunisia, $5.1 million attributable to an unsuccessful
    suspended well in the Company’s Anaguid permit in Tunisia
    and various other exploratory wells. The United States leasehold
    abandonments and other costs during the year ended
    December 31, 2005 include a $39.8 million increase in
    East Cameron abandonment obligations that resulted from
    hurricane damage. During 2005, the Company



completed and evaluated 180 exploration/extension wells, 149 of
    which were successfully completed as discoveries.

Significant components of the Company’s dry hole expense
    during 2004 included $27.7 million and $10.5 million
    on the Company’s deepwater Gulf of Mexico Juno and Myrtle
    Beach prospects, respectively, $19.0 million on the
    Company’s Gabonese Olowi prospect and $5.8 million on
    the Company’s Bravo prospect offshore Equatorial Guinea.
    During 2004, the Company completed and evaluated 103
    exploration/extension wells, 58 of which were successfully
    completed as discoveries.

General and administrative
    expense.

General and administrative expense
    totaled $124.6 million ($1.94 per BOE),
    $80.3 million ($1.24 per BOE) and $60.3 million
    ($1.14 per BOE) during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
    The increase in general and administrative expense during 2005,
    as compared to 2004, was primarily due to increases in
    administrative staff, including staff increases associated with
    the Evergreen merger, and performance-related compensation costs
    including the amortization of restricted stock awarded to
    officers, directors and employees during 2005.

The increase in general and administrative expense during 2004,
    as compared to 2003, was primarily due to increases in
    administrative staff, including staff increases associated with
    the Evergreen merger, and performance-related compensation costs
    including the amortization of restricted stock awarded to
    officers, directors and employees during 2004.

Interest expense.

Interest expense was
    $127.8 million, $103.4 million and $91.4 million
    during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The weighted average
    interest rate on the Company’s indebtedness for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 was 6.5 percent, as compared
    to 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent for the years ended
    December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, including the
    effects of interest rate derivatives. The increase in interest
    expense for 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to
    increased average borrowings under the Company’s lines of
    credit, primarily as a result of the cash portion of the
    consideration paid in the Evergreen merger and
    $949.3 million of stock repurchases completed during 2005,
    a $17.3 million decrease in the amortization of interest
    rate hedge gains, the assumption of $300 million of notes
    in connection with the Evergreen merger and higher interest
    rates in 2005.

The increase in interest expense for 2004 as compared to 2003
    was primarily due to a $7.9 million decrease in interest
    rate hedge gains, a $3.4 million decrease in capitalized
    interest as the Company completed its major development projects
    in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa, increased borrowings
    under the Company’s lines of credit, primarily as a result
    of the Evergreen merger, and the assumption of $300 million
    of notes in connection with the Evergreen merger.

See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for additional information about the
    Company’s long-term debt and interest expense.

Other expenses.

Other expenses were
    $112.8 million during 2005, as compared to
    $33.7 million during 2004 and $21.3 million during
    2003. The increase in other expenses during 2005, as compared to
    2004, is primarily attributable to a $26.5 million loss on
    the redemption and tender of portions of the Company’s
    senior notes, a $50.5 million increase in hedge
    ineffectiveness and a $3.1 million increase in amortization
    of noncompete agreements associated with the Evergreen merger.
    The increase in other expense for 2004 as compared to 2003 was
    primarily due to an increase in contingency accrual adjustments
    of $11.8 million. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” for a detailed
    description of the components included in other expenses.

Income tax benefits (provisions).

The
    Company recognized income tax provisions on continuing
    operations of $291.7 million and $164.2 million during
    2005 and 2004, respectively, and income tax benefits on
    continuing operations of $67.4 million during 2003. The
    2003 deferred United States federal, state and local tax
    benefits include a $197.7 million benefit from the reversal
    of the Company’s valuation allowances against United States
    deferred tax assets.



The Company’s effective tax rate of 40.8 percent for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the combined
    United States federal and state statutory rate of approximately
    36.5 percent primarily due to:

•

The second quarter reversal of the $26.9 million tax
    benefit recorded in 2004 as a result of the cancellation of the
    development of the Olowi block and the Company’s decision
    to exit Gabon. The Company reversed the tax benefit as a result
    of signing an agreement in June 2005 to sell its shares in the
    subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block which made
    it more likely than not that the Company would not realize the
    originally recorded tax benefit,

•

The Company recognized a gain of approximately
    $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 relating to the
    sale of shares in a subsidiary that owns the interest in the
    Olowi Block located in Gabon. There is no associated income tax
    effect either in Gabon or the United States associated with the
    gain, which partially offsets the effects of the previous item,

•

Recording $6.8 million of taxes associated with the
    repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”),

•

Expenses for unsuccessful well costs in foreign locations where
    the Company receives no expected income tax benefits,

•

Foreign tax rate differentials and

•

Foreign statutes that differ from those in the United States.

See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and
    Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding
    the Company’s tax position.

Discontinued operations.

The Company
    recognized income from discontinued operations of
    $110.8 million during 2005, as compared to
    $13.9 million during 2004 and $17.4 million during
    2003. During 2005, the Company sold its interests in
    (a) the Martin Creek, Conroy Black and Lookout Butte areas
    in Canada for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in
    a gain of $138.3 million and (b) certain assets on the
    shelf of the Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of
    $59.1 million, resulting in a gain of $27.7 million.
    In 2005, the Company recognized an income tax provision of
    $73.1 million associated with these divestitures. Pursuant
    to SFAS 144, the gain and the results of operations from
    these assets have been reclassified to discontinued operations.
    See Note V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” for additional data on discontinued operations.

The Company’s high effective tax rate associated with
    discontinued operations during 2005 (39.7 percent) was
    primarily due to:

•

A United States deferred tax provision of $17.1 million
    being triggered by the gain recorded on the Canadian
    divestiture. The Canadian gain caused the recharacterization of
    Argentine dividend income from prior years that was previously
    offset by historical Canadian losses,

•

Cash taxes of $2.5 million associated with the repatriation
    of foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA and

•

A decrease in the Canadian valuation allowance of
    $13.4 million, which partially offset the above two items.
    The Canadian divestiture utilized a substantial portion of the
    Company’s Canadian tax pools. Consequently, the Company
    reassessed the likelihood that the remaining Canadian tax
    attributes will be utilized and determined it is now more likely
    than not that it will be able to utilize more of its tax pools
    than previously expected.

For years prior to the Canadian divestiture, the Company’s
    discontinued operations reflect no Canadian tax provisions due
    to the Company having maintained a valuation allowance related
    to its Canadian deferred tax assets. During those prior years,
    management’s expectation was that it was likely that the
    Company would not realize its Canadian deferred tax assets.
    Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, portions of the Canadian
    valuation allowance were released only to the extent that
    Canadian income was recorded, thereby offsetting any tax
    provisions.



The Company’s effective tax rate for United States
    discontinued operations during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
    approximately 36.5 percent.

Cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle.

The Company adopted the provisions
    of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and recognized a
    $15.4 million benefit from the cumulative effect of change
    in accounting principle, net of $1.3 million of deferred
    income taxes.

Capital
    Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity

Capital commitments.

The Company’s
    primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and
    acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of contractual
    obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for
    exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas
    properties and repayment of contractual obligations may be
    provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow,
    proceeds from the disposition of nonstrategic assets or
    alternative financing sources as discussed in “Capital
    resources” below. Generally, funding for the Company’s
    working capital obligations is provided by internally-generated
    cash flows.

Payments for acquisitions, net of cash
    acquired.

In 2004, the Company paid
    $880.4 million of cash, net of $12.1 million of cash
    acquired, to complete the Evergreen merger. As noted above, the
    Company also assumed $300 million principal amount of
    Evergreen notes and other current and noncurrent obligations
    associated with the Evergreen merger. As is further discussed in
    “Financing activities” below, and in Notes C and
    F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data”, the Company financed the cash costs utilizing credit
    facilities in place at the time of the merger.

Oil and gas properties.

The
    Company’s cash expenditures for additions to oil and gas
    properties during 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $1.1 billion,
    $562.9 million and $662.6 million, respectively. The
    Company’s 2005, 2004 and 2003 expenditures for additions to
    oil and gas properties were internally funded by
    $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $738.1 million,
    respectively, of net cash provided by operating activities.

The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at reasonable
    levels in order to provide sufficient financial flexibility to
    take advantage of future opportunities. The Company’s
    preliminary capital budget for 2006 is expected to be
    approximately $1.3 billion. The Company believes that
    proceeds from asset divestitures and net cash provided by
    operating activities during 2006, based on the current price
    environment, will be sufficient to fund the 2006 capital
    expenditures budget.

Off-balance sheet arrangements.

From

time-to-time,

the Company enters into off-balance sheet arrangements and
    transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet
    obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2005, the
    material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that
    the Company has entered into include (i) undrawn letters of
    credit, (ii) operating lease agreements,
    (iii) drilling commitments, (iv) VPP obligations (to
    physically deliver volumes and pay related lease operating
    expenses in the future) and (v) contractual obligations for
    which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and
    determinable such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to
    future changes in commodity prices and gas transportation
    commitments. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements
    described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements
    or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other
    persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the
    Company’s liquidity or availability of or requirements for
    capital resources. See “Contractual obligations” below
    for more information regarding the Company’s off-balance
    sheet arrangements.

Contractual obligations.

The
    Company’s contractual obligations include long-term debt,
    operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations,
    other liabilities, transportation commitments and VPP
    obligations.



The following table summarizes by period the payments due by the

Environmental contingency.

A subsidiary
    of the Company has been notified by a letter from the Texas
    Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) dated
    August 24, 2005 that the TCEQ considers the subsidiary to
    be a potentially responsible party with respect to the
    Dorchester Refining Company State Superfund Site located in
    Mount Pleasant, Texas. The subsidiary, which was acquired by the
    Company in 1991, owned a refinery located at the Mount Pleasant
    site from 1977 until 1984. According to the TCEQ, this refinery
    was responsible for releases of hazardous substances into the
    environment. The Company does not know the nature and extent of
    the alleged



contamination, the potential costs of remediation, or the
    portion, if any, of such costs that may be allocable to the
    Company’s subsidiary. However, based on the limited
    information currently available and assessed regarding this
    matter, the Company has no reason to believe that it may have a
    material adverse effect on its future financial condition,
    results of operations or liquidity. See Note I of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional
    information regarding this matter as well as other environmental
    and legal contingencies involving the Company.

Capital resources.

The Company’s
    primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating
    activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from
    sales of nonstrategic assets. The Company expects that these
    resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments
    during 2006 and for the foreseeable future.

Asset divestitures.

During May 2005,
    the Company sold all of its interests in the Martin Creek,
    Conroy Black and Lookout Butte oil and gas properties in Canada
    for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in a gain of
    $138.3 million. During August 2005, the Company sold all of
    its interests in certain oil and gas properties on the shelf of
    the Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $59.1 million,
    resulting in a gain of $27.7 million. During October 2005,
    the Company sold all of its shares in a subsidiary that owns the
    interest in the Olowi block in Gabon for net proceeds of
    $47.9 million, resulting in a gain of $47.5 million.
    The net cash proceeds from these divestitures were used to
    reduce outstanding indebtedness.

During January 2005, the Company sold two percent of its total
    proved reserves, or 20.5 MMBOE of proved reserves, by means
    of two VPPs for net proceeds of $592.3 million, including
    the assignment of the Company’s obligations under certain
    derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the VPPs were
    initially used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.

During April 2005, the Company sold less than one percent of its
    total proved reserves, or 7.3 MMBOE of proved reserves, by
    means of another VPP for net proceeds of $300.3 million,
    including the assignment of the Company’s obligations under
    certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the VPP were
    initially used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.

See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding
    the Company’s VPPs.

Operating activities.

Net cash provided
    by operating activities during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
    $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $738.1 million,
    respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2005, as compared to that of 2004, was primarily
    due to higher commodity prices. The increase in net cash
    provided by operating activities in 2004, as compared to that of
    2003, was primarily due to increased production volumes and
    higher commodity prices.

Investing activities.

Net cash provided
    by investing activities during 2005 was $84.7 million, as
    compared to net cash used in investing activities during 2004
    and 2003 of $1.5 billion and $636.7 million,
    respectively. The decrease in net cash used in investing
    activities during 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due
    to (i) $1.2 billion in proceeds from asset
    divestitures in 2005 which included $892.6 million of net
    proceeds received from VPPs sold during 2005,
    (ii) $880.4 million of cash consideration paid in 2004
    in connection with the Evergreen merger and (iii) offset by
    an increase of $560.4 million in additions to oil and gas
    properties. The increase in net cash used in investing
    activities during 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to
    $880.4 million of cash consideration paid in the third
    quarter of 2004 in connection with the Evergreen merger. See
    “Results of Operations” above and Note N of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” for additional information regarding asset
    divestitures.

Financing activities.

Net cash used in
    financing activities was $1.4 billion and
    $91.7 million during 2005 and 2003, respectively. Net cash
    provided by financing activities during 2004 was
    $414.3 million. During 2005, financing activities were
    comprised of $353.6 million of net principal repayments on
    long-term debt, $78.3 million of payments of other
    noncurrent liabilities, primarily comprised of cash settlements
    of acquired hedge obligations, $30.3 million of dividends
    paid and $949.3 million of treasury stock purchases,
    partially offset by $41.6 million of proceeds from the
    exercise of long-term incentive plan stock options and employee
    stock purchases. During 2004, financing activities were
    comprised of $553.4 million of net principal borrowings on
    long-term debt, $54.3 million of payments of other
    noncurrent liabilities, primarily comprised of settlements of
    fair value and acquired hedge



obligations and other financial obligations, $26.6 million
    of dividends paid and $92.3 million of treasury stock
    purchases, partially offset by $35.1 million of proceeds
    from the exercise of long-term incentive plan stock options and
    employee stock purchases. During 2003, financing activities were
    comprised of $105.5 million of net principal payments on
    long-term debt, $14.1 million of payments of other
    noncurrent liabilities, $2.8 million of payments for
    deferred loan fees and $2.3 million of treasury stock
    purchases, partially offset by $33.0 million of proceeds
    from the exercise of long-term incentive plan stock options and
    employee stock purchases.

During April 2005, $131.0 million of the Company’s


/


% senior
    notes due 2005 matured and were repaid. During 2005, the Company
    also redeemed the remaining $64.0 million and
    $16.2 million, respectively, of aggregate principal amount
    of its


/


% senior
    notes due 2010 and its 7.50% senior notes due 2012. During
    September 2005, the Company accepted tenders to purchase
    $188.4 million in principal amount of the
    5.875% senior notes due 2012 for $199.9 million. The
    Company utilized unused borrowing capacity under its line of
    credit to fund these financing activities.

During September 2005, the Company announced that the Board had
    approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the purchase
    of up to $1 billion of the Company’s common stock,
    $650 million of which was immediately initiated. As of
    December 31, 2005, the Company had expended
    $640.7 million of the $1 billion repurchase program
    through (i) open market purchases and (ii) a
    repurchase plan adopted by the Company conforming to the
    requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

of the Exchange Act. The remaining $350 million is subject
    to the completion of the planned deepwater Gulf of Mexico and
    Argentine divestments. During 2005 and 2004, the Company
    expended a total of $949.3 million to acquire
    20.0 million shares of treasury stock and
    $92.3 million to acquire 2.8 million shares of
    treasury stock, respectively.

During September 2005, the Company entered into an amended
    credit facility that provides for initial aggregate loan
    commitments of $1.5 billion and a five-year term (the
    “Amended Credit Agreement”). In connection with the
    funding of the Amended Credit Agreement on September 30,
    2005, all amounts outstanding under a

364-day

credit facility, which was established to fund the Evergreen
    purchase in September 2004, were retired and the

364-day

credit facility terminated.

As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various
    financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt,
    convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The
    Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas
    properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas
    companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a
    class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as
    dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights
    and preferences as determined by the Board.

Liquidity.

The Company’s principal
    source of short-term liquidity is the Amended Credit Agreement.
    There were $900 million of outstanding borrowings under the
    Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2005. Including
    $80.3 million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit
    under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company had
    $519.7 million of unused borrowing capacity as of
    December 31, 2005.

The announced plans to divest the Company’s Argentine
    assets and deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets, if successful, will
    have a positive impact on Pioneer’s future liquidity.
    Proceeds from one or both of these planned divestitures may be
    used to (i) pay down existing borrowings on the Amended
    Credit Agreement, (ii) complete the $1 billion share
    repurchase, (iii) reduce existing obligations,
    (iv) fund capital commitments or (v) fund working
    capital needs. Also, the Company may decide to maintain a
    certain level of any proceeds in cash and investments for future
    liquidity purposes. There can be no assurances that the Company
    will successfully conclude the announced plans to divest the
    Argentine assets or deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets.

Debt ratings.

The Company receives debt
    credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Group, Inc. (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”), which are subject to
    regular reviews. During the fourth quarter of 2005, S&P cut
    the Company’s corporate credit rating to BB+ with a stable
    outlook from BBB-. During January 2006, Moody’s cut the
    Company’s corporate credit rating to Ba1 with a negative
    outlook from Baa3. S&P and Moody’s consider many
    factors in determining the Company’s ratings including:
    production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and
    asset and reserve mix. As a result of the downgrades, the
    interest rate and fees the Company pays on the Amended Credit
    Agreement have increased and additional debt covenant
    requirements under the Amended Credit Agreement were triggered.
    Subsequent to December 31, 2005, as a result of the
    Company’s downgrades by the rating agencies, the Company
    has issued or may be required to issue additional



letters of credits of approximately $73 million pursuant to
    agreements that contain provisions with rating triggers. The
    individual downgrades are not expected to materially affect the
    Company’s financial position or liquidity, but could
    negatively impact the Company’s ability to obtain
    additional financing or the interest rate and fees associated
    with such additional financing.

Book capitalization and current
    ratio.

The Company’s book capitalization
    at December 31, 2005 was $4.3 billion, consisting of
    debt of $2.1 billion and stockholders’ equity of
    $2.2 billion. Consequently, the Company’s debt to book
    capitalization increased to 48 percent at December 31,
    2005 from 46 percent at December 31, 2004. The
    Company’s ratio of current assets to current liabilities
    was .60 to 1.00 at December 31, 2005 as compared to .72 to
    1.00 at December 31, 2004. The decline in the
    Company’s ratio of current assets to current liabilities
    was primarily due to its current derivative liabilities as a
    result of higher commodity prices and current deferred revenue
    as a result of the VPPs.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for
    inclusion in this Report in accordance with GAAP. See
    Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for a comprehensive discussion of the
    Company’s significant accounting policies. GAAP represents
    a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and
    requirements, the application of which requires management
    judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances,
    choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. Following is a
    discussion of the Company’s most critical accounting
    estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the
    Company’s application of GAAP.

Accounting for oil and gas producing
    activities.

The accounting for and disclosure
    of oil and gas producing activities requires the Company’s
    management to choose between GAAP alternatives and to make
    judgments about estimates of future uncertainties.

Asset retirement obligations.

The
    Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment
    and facilities and to restore land or seabed at the end of oil
    and gas production operations. The Company’s removal and
    restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging
    and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil
    and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal
    costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and
    judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years
    in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague
    descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal
    technologies and  costs are constantly changing, as are
    regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public
    relations considerations.

On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS 143. SFAS 143 significantly changed the method of
    accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur
    related to the retirement of fixed assets. SFAS 143,
    together with the related FASB Interpretation No. 47,
    “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,
    an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143”
    (“FIN 47”), requires the Company to record a
    separate liability for the discounted present value of the
    Company’s asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting
    increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance
    sheet.

Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous
    assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement
    amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates,
    timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory,
    environmental and political environments. To the extent future
    revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the
    existing asset retirement obligations, a corresponding
    adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. See
    Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding
    the Company’s asset retirement obligations.

Successful efforts method of
    accounting.

The Company utilizes the
    successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
    producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full
    cost method. In general, the Company believes that, during
    periods of active exploration, net assets and net income are
    more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method
    of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under
    the full cost method. The critical difference between the
    successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method
    is as follows: under the successful efforts method, exploratory
    dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration



costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which
    they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting,
    such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with
    the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings
    of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During
    2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized exploration,
    abandonment, geological and geophysical expense from continuing
    operations of $266.8 million, $180.8 million and
    $131.2 million, respectively, under the successful efforts
    method.

Proved reserve estimates.

Estimates of
    the Company’s proved reserves included in this Report are
    prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The
    accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:

•

the quality and quantity of available data,

•

the interpretation of that data,

•

the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and

•

the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.

The Company’s proved reserve information included in this
    Report as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was prepared
    by the Company’s engineers and audited by independent
    petroleum engineers with respect to the Company’s major
    properties. Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or
    lower than those included herein.

Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which
    may substantially differ from future actual results, reserve
    estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas
    that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling,
    testing and production after the date of an estimate may
    justify, positively or negatively, material revisions to the
    estimate of proved reserves.

It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included
    in this Report as of December 31, 2005 is the current
    market value of the Company’s estimated proved reserves. In
    accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the
    Standardized Measure on prices and costs on the date of the
    estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially
    higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the
    estimate. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for
    additional information regarding estimates of reserves and
    future net revenues.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves materially
    impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves
    decline, the rate at which the Company records depletion expense
    will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may
    result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomical
    to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a
    decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of
    the Company’s assessment of its oil and gas producing
    properties and goodwill for impairment.

Impairment of proved oil and gas
    properties.

The Company reviews its
    long-lived proved properties to be held and used whenever
    management determines that events or circumstances indicate that
    the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be
    recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an impairment
    provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future
    commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the
    properties and if a significant downward revision has occurred
    to the estimated proved reserves. Proved oil and gas properties
    are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of
    proved properties is calculated.

Impairment of unproved oil and gas
    properties.

Management periodically assesses
    unproved oil and gas properties for impairment, on a

project-by-project

basis. Management’s assessment of the results of
    exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future
    sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impacts
    the amount and timing of impairment provisions, if any.

Suspended wells.

The Company suspends
    the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons
    pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the
    oil and gas discovery. The ultimate disposition of these well
    costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity
    and development decisions. If the Company decides not to pursue
    additional appraisal activities or development of these fields,
    the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and
    abandonment expense.



The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an
    exploratory well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets
    for more than one year following the completion of drilling
    unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas reserves in an
    area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the
    following conditions are met:

(i) The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
    justify its completion as a producing well.

(ii) The Company is making sufficient progress assessing
    the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
    project.

Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical
    location of certain Alaskan, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and
    foreign projects, it may take the Company longer than one year
    to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and
    economics associated with making a determination on its
    commercial viability. In these instances, the project’s
    feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or
    advances in technology, but rather the Company’s ongoing
    efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the
    hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information, gaining
    access to other companies’ production, transportation or
    processing facilities

and/or

getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells.
    These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly.
    Consequently, the Company’s assessment of suspended
    exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be
    made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial
    and is impaired. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional
    information regarding the Company’s suspended exploratory
    well costs.

Assessments of functional
    currencies.

Management determines the
    functional currencies of the Company’s subsidiaries based
    on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in
    which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating
    revenues, costs and expenses. The U.S. dollar is the
    functional currency of all of the Company’s international
    operations except Canada. The assessment of functional
    currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of
    operations and financial position.

Argentine economic and currency
    measures.

The accounting for and
    remeasurement of the Company’s Argentine balance sheets as
    of December 31, 2005 and 2004 reflect management’s
    assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to
    Argentina’s current economic situation. The Argentine
    economic and political situation continues to evolve and the
    Argentine government may enact future regulations or policies
    that, when finalized and adopted, may materially impact, among
    other items, (i) the realized prices the Company receives
    for the commodities it produces and sells; (ii) the timing
    of repatriations of excess cash flow to the Company’s
    corporate headquarters in the United States; (iii) the
    Company’s asset valuations; and (iv) peso-denominated
    monetary assets and liabilities. See “Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”
    and Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for a description of the assumptions
    utilized in the preparation of these financial statements.

Deferred tax asset valuation
    allowances.

The Company continually assesses
    both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is
    more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be
    realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors
    Company-specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic
    factors and reassesses the likelihood that the Company’s
    net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax
    attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their
    expiration. There can be no assurances that facts and
    circumstances will not materially change and require the Company
    to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain
    jurisdictions in a future period. As of December 31, 2005,
    the Company does not believe there is sufficient positive
    evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to certain
    foreign tax jurisdictions.

Goodwill impairment.

The Company
    reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually. This
    requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the assets
    and liabilities of the reporting units that have goodwill. There
    is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values,
    particularly proved reserve estimates as described above. See
    Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for additional information.

Litigation and environmental
    contingencies.

The Company makes judgments
    and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation
    and environmental remediation. Actual costs can vary from such
    estimates for a variety of reasons. The costs to settle
    litigation can vary from estimates based on differing
    interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the
    amount of damages. Similarly, environmental remediation
    liabilities are



subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations,
    additional information obtained relating to the extent and
    nature of site contamination and improvements in technology.
    Under GAAP, a liability is recorded for these types of
    contingencies if the Company determines the loss to be both
    probable and reasonably estimated. See Note I of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional
    information regarding the Company’s commitments and
    contingencies.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

The following discussions provide information about new
    accounting pronouncements that have been issued by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”):

SFAS 123(R).

In December 2004, the
    FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
    “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”),
    which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).
    SFAS 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles
    Bulletin Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”) and amends
    SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows”.
    Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the
    approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R)
    will require all share-based payments to employees, including
    grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as
    stock-based compensation expense in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their fair
    values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

SFAS 123(R) must be adopted no later than January 1,
    2006 and permits public companies to adopt its requirements
    using one of two methods:

•

A “modified prospective” method in which compensation
    cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on
    the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based
    payments granted after the adoption date and based on the
    requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to
    employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123(R) that
    remain unvested on the adoption date.

•

A “modified retrospective” method which includes the
    requirements of the modified prospective method described above,
    but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods
    presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based
    on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS 123 for
    purposes of pro forma disclosures.

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) on
    January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company accounted for
    share-based payments to employees prior to January 1, 2006
    using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 and
    related interpretations. As such, the Company generally did not
    recognize compensation expense associated with employee stock
    option grants. The Company has not issued stock options to
    employees since 2003. Consequently, the adoption of
    SFAS 123(R)’s fair value method will not have a
    significant impact on the Company’s future result of
    operations or financial position. Had the Company adopted
    SFAS 123(R) in prior periods, the impact would have
    approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as described in the pro
    forma disclosures in Note B of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data”. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have no effect
    on future results of operations related to the Company’s
    unvested outstanding restricted stock awards. The Company
    estimates that the adoption of SFAS 123(R), based on
    estimated outstanding unvested stock options, will result in
    compensation charges of approximately $1.0 million during
    2006.

The Company’s ESPP that allows eligible employees to
    annually purchase the Company’s common stock at a discount.
    The provisions of SFAS 123(R) will cause the ESPP to be a
    compensatory plan. However, the change in accounting for the
    ESPP is not expected to have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position, future results of operations
    or liquidity. Historically, the ESPP compensatory amounts have
    been nominal. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding
    the ESPP.

SFAS 123(R) also requires that tax benefits in excess of
    recognized compensation expenses be reported as a financing cash
    flow, rather than an operating cash flow as required under prior
    literature. This requirement may



serve to reduce the Company’s future cash flows from
    operating activities and increase future cash flows from
    financing activities, to the extent of associated tax benefits
    that may be realized in the future.

FIN 47.

In March 2005, the FASB
    issued FIN 47. FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset
    retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and
    should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be
    reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of
    FIN 47 effective on December 31, 2005. The adoption of
    FIN 47 had no impact on the Company’s financial
    position or results of operations.

FSP

FAS 19-1

amended SFAS No. 19, “Financial Accounting and

    exploratory well costs beyond one year from the completion of
    drilling under circumstances where the well has found a
    sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
    producing well and the enterprise is making sufficient progress
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
    of the project. FSP

FAS 19-1

also amended SFAS 19 to require enhanced disclosures of
    suspended exploratory well costs in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted the new
    requirements during the second quarter of 2005. See Note D
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” for additional information regarding the
    Company’s exploratory well costs. The adoption of FSP

FAS 19-1

    position or results of operations.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The following quantitative and qualitative information is
    provided about financial instruments to which the Company was a
    party as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and from which the
    Company may incur future gains or losses from changes in market
    interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices.
    Although certain derivative contracts to which the Company has
    been a party to did not qualify as hedges, the Company does not
    enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading
    purposes.

The fair value of the Company’s derivative contracts are
    determined based on counterparties’ estimates and valuation
    models. The Company did not change its valuation method during
    2005. During 2005, the Company was a party to commodity,
    interest rate and foreign exchange rate swap contracts and
    commodity collar contracts. See Note J of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional
    information regarding the Company’s derivative contracts,
    including deferred gains and losses on terminated derivative
    contracts. The following table reconciles the changes that
    occurred in the fair values of the Company’s open
    derivative contracts during 2005:

Quantitative
    Disclosures

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity.

From

time-to-time,

the Company’s Canadian subsidiary enters into short-term
    forward currency agreements to purchase Canadian dollars with
    U.S. dollar gas sales proceeds. The Company does not
    designate these derivatives as hedges due to their short-term
    nature. There were no outstanding forward currency agreements at
    December 31, 2005.



Interest rate sensitivity.

The
    following tables provide information about other financial
    instruments to which the Company was a party as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 and that were sensitive to
    changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables
    present maturities by expected maturity dates, the weighted
    average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given
    current contractual terms and market conditions and the
    debt’s estimated fair value. For fixed rate debt, the
    weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed
    rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the
    debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. For variable rate
    debt, the average interest rate represents the average rates
    being paid on the debt projected forward proportionate to the
    forward yield curve for LIBOR on February 15, 2006. As of
    December 31, 2005, the Company was not a party to material
    derivatives that would subject it to interest rate sensitivity.

Commodity price sensitivity.

The
    following tables provide information about the Company’s
    oil and gas derivative financial instruments that were sensitive
    to changes in oil and gas prices as of December 31, 2005
    and 2004. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, all of the
    Company’s oil and gas derivative financial instruments
    qualified as hedges.

Commodity hedge instruments.

The
    Company hedges commodity price risk with derivative contracts,
    such as swap and collar contracts. Swap contracts provide a
    fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes. Collar
    contracts provide minimum (“floor”) and maximum
    (“ceiling”) prices for the Company on a notional
    amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price
    participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor
    price.



See Notes B, E and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data” for a description of the accounting
    procedures followed by the Company relative to hedge derivative
    financial instruments and for specific information regarding the

To minimize basis risk, the Company
    enters into basis swaps for a portion of its gas hedges to
    convert the index price of the hedging instrument from a NYMEX
    index to an index which reflects the geographic area of

    the associated swap and collar contracts and, accordingly, the
    effects of the basis swaps have been presented together with the
    associated contracts.

Qualitative
    Disclosures

Non-derivative financial
    instruments.

The Company is a borrower under
    fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to
    interest rate risk. The Company’s objective in borrowing
    under fixed or variable rate debt is to satisfy capital
    requirements while minimizing the Company’s costs of
    capital. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data” for a discussion of the
    Company’s debt instruments.

Derivative financial instruments.

The
    Company utilizes interest rate, foreign exchange rate and
    commodity price derivative contracts to hedge interest rate,
    foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks in accordance
    with policies and guidelines approved by the Board. In
    accordance with those policies and guidelines, the
    Company’s executive management determines the appropriate
    timing and extent of hedge transactions.

Foreign currency, operations and price
    risk.

International investments represent,
    and are expected to continue to represent, a significant portion
    of the Company’s total assets. Pioneer currently has
    international operations in Africa, Argentina and Canada, which
    represent nine, eight and five percent of the Company’s
    2005 oil and gas revenues, respectively. Pioneer continues to
    identify and evaluate other international opportunities. As a
    result of such foreign operations, Pioneer’s financial
    results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, weak economic conditions or changes in
    political climates in these foreign countries.

The Company’s international operations may be adversely
    affected by political and economic instability, changes in the
    legal and regulatory environment and other factors. For example:

•

local political and economic developments could restrict or
    increase the cost of Pioneer’s foreign operations,

•

exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in
    financial losses,

•

royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could
    increase costs of Pioneer’s foreign operations,

•

expropriation of the Company’s property could result in
    loss of revenue, property and equipment,

•

civil uprising, riots, terrorist attacks and wars could make it
    impractical to continue operations, resulting in financial
    losses,

•

import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies
    could result in loss of revenues,

•

repatriation levels for export revenues could restrict the
    availability of cash to fund operations outside a particular
    foreign country and

•

laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade,
    taxation and investment could restrict Pioneer’s ability to
    fund foreign operations or may make foreign operations more
    costly.

Pioneer does not currently maintain political risk insurance.
    Pioneer evaluates on a

country-by-country

basis whether obtaining political risk coverage is necessary and
    may add such insurance in the future if the Company believes it
    is prudent.

Africa.

Pioneer’s operations in
    Africa are in Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, South Africa and
    Tunisia. The Company views the operating environment in these
    African nations as stable and the economic stability as good.
    While the values of the various African nations’ currencies
    do fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company
    believes that any currency risk associated with Pioneer’s
    African operations would not have a material impact on the
    Company’s results of operations given that such operations
    are closely tied to oil prices which are denominated in
    U.S. dollars.

Argentina.

During the decade of the
    1990s, Argentina’s government pursued free market policies,
    including the privatization of state-owned companies,
    deregulation of the oil and gas industry, tax reforms to
    equalize tax rates for domestic and foreign investors,
    liberalization of import and export laws and the lifting of
    exchange controls. The cornerstone of these reforms was the 1991
    convertibility law that established an exchange rate of one
    Argentine



peso to one U.S. dollar. These policies were successful as
    evidenced by the elimination of inflation and substantial
    economic growth during the early to mid-1990s. However,
    throughout the decade, the Argentine government failed to
    balance its fiscal budget, repeatedly incurring significant
    fiscal deficits such that by the end of 2001 Argentina had
    accumulated $130 billion of debt.

During 2001, Argentina found itself in a critical economic
    situation with the combination of high levels of external
    indebtedness, a financial and banking system in crisis, a
    country risk rating that had reached levels beyond the
    historical norm, a high level of unemployment and an economic
    contraction that had lasted four years.

Late in 2001, the country was unable to obtain additional
    funding from the International Monetary Fund. Economic
    instability increased, resulting in substantial withdrawals of
    cash from the Argentine banking system over a short period of
    time. The government was forced to implement monetary
    restrictions and placed limitations on the transfer of funds out
    of the country without the authorization of the Central Bank of
    the Republic of Argentina. President De la Rua and his entire
    administration were forced to resign in the face of public
    dissatisfaction. After his resignation in December 2001, there
    was, for a few weeks, a revolving door of presidents that were
    appointed to office by Argentina’s Congress, but quickly
    resigned in reaction to public outcry. Eduardo Duhalde was
    appointed President of Argentina in January 2002 to hold office
    until the 2003 Presidential election.

In January 2002, the government defaulted on a significant
    portion of Argentina’s $130 billion of debt and the
    national Congress passed Emergency Law 25,561, which, among
    other things, overturned the long standing, but unsustainable,
    convertibility plan. The government adopted a floating rate of
    exchange in February 2002. Two specific provisions of the
    Emergency Law directly impact the Company. First, a tax on the
    value of hydrocarbon exports was established effective
    March 1, 2002. The second provision was the requirement
    that domestic commercial transactions, or contracts, for sales
    in Argentina that were previously denominated in
    U.S. dollars be converted to pesos (i.e., pesofication) at
    an exchange rate to be negotiated between sellers and buyers.
    Furthermore, the government placed a price freeze on gas prices
    at the wellhead. With the price of gas pesofied and frozen, the
    U.S. dollar-equivalent price of gas in Argentina fell in
    direct proportion to the level of devaluation.

The abandonment of the convertibility plan and the decision to
    allow the peso to float in international exchange markets
    resulted in significant devaluation of the peso. By
    September 30, 2002, the

peso-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate had increased from 1:1 to 3.74:1. However, since
    the end of the third quarter of 2002, Argentina’s economy
    has shown signs of stabilization. At December 31, 2005, the

peso-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate was 3.03:1.

In Argentina, unlike Pioneer’s other operating areas, there
    have been significant factors that have kept the commodity
    prices, in general, below those of the world markets and may
    continue to do so. The following is a discussion of the matters
    affecting Argentine commodity prices:

•

Oil Prices

— In January 2002, the
    Argentine government devalued the peso and enacted an emergency
    law that, in part, required certain contracts that were
    previously payable in U.S. dollars to be payable in pesos.
    Subsequently, in February 2002, the Argentine government
    announced a 20 percent tax on oil exports, effective
    March 1, 2002. The tax is limited by law to a term of no
    more than five years. The export tax is not deducted in the
    calculation of royalty payments. Domestic Argentine oil sales,
    while valued in U.S. dollars, are now being paid in pesos.
    Export oil sales continue to be valued and paid in
    U.S. dollars.

In January 2003, at the Argentine government’s request, oil
    producers and refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for certain
    domestic sales at $28.50 per Bbl which remained in effect
    through April 2004. The producers and refiners further agreed
    that the difference between the actual price and the capped
    price would be payable once actual prices fall below the $28.50
    cap. Subsequently the terms were modified such that while the
    $28.50 per Bbl payable cap was in place, the refiners would
    have no obligation to pay producers for sales values that
    exceeded $36.00 per Bbl. Initially, the refiners and
    producers also agreed to discount U.S. dollar-denominated
    oil prices at 90 percent prior to converting to pesos at
    the current exchange rate for the purpose of invoicing and
    settling oil sales to Argentine refiners. In May 2004, refiners
    and producers changed the discount percentage from
    90 percent for all price levels to 86 percent if WTI
    was equal to or less



than $36 per Bbl and 80 percent if WTI exceeded
    $36 per Bbl. All the oil prices are adjusted for normal
    quality differentials prior to applying the discount.

In May 2004, the Argentine government increased the export tax
    from 20 percent to 25 percent. This tax is applied on
    the sales value after the tax, thus, the net effect of the
    20 percent and 25 percent rates is 16.7 percent
    and 20 percent, respectively. In August 2004, the Argentine
    government further increased the export tax rates for oil
    exports. The export tax now escalates from the current
    25 percent (20 percent effective rate) to a maximum
    rate of 45 percent (31 percent effective rate) of the
    realized value for exported Bbls as WTI prices per Bbl increase
    from less than $32.00 to $45.00 and above.

On December 24, 2004, the Secretary of Energy issued
    Administrative Resolution 1679/2004, in order to alleviate
    shortages in domestic diesel markets by insuring adequate oil
    supplies to Argentine refiners. The terms of the resolution
    require producers to submit evidence to the Secretary of Energy
    that its oil to be exported has been offered to domestic
    refiners prior to the government’s issuance of export
    permission.

During 2003, the Company exported approximately five percent of
    its Argentine oil production. Associated therewith, the Company
    incurred oil export taxes of $1.2 million for 2003. During
    2004 and 2005, the Company did not export any of its Argentine
    oil production. As noted above, the export tax has also had the
    effect of decreasing internal Argentine oil revenues (not only
    export revenues) by the taxes levied. The U.S. dollar
    equivalent value for domestic Argentine oil sales has generally
    moved toward parity with the U.S. dollar-denominated export
    values, net of the export tax. The adverse impact of this tax
    has been partially offset by the net cost savings resulting from
    the devaluation of the peso on peso-denominated costs such as
    labor. Given the number of governmental changes during 2005
    affecting the realized price the Company receives for its oil
    sales, no specific predictions can be made about the future of
    oil prices in Argentina. However, the Company expects Argentine
    oil realizations to continue to be less than oil realizations in
    the United States.

•

Gas Prices

— The Company sells its
    gas to Argentine customers pursuant to (a) peso-denominated
    contracts, (b) long-term dollar-denominated contracts and
    (c) spot market sales. As a result of the economic
    emergency law enacted by the Argentine government in January
    2002, the Company’s gas prices, expressed in
    U.S. dollars, have fallen in proportion to the devaluation
    of the Argentine peso since the end of 2001 due to the
    pesofication of contracts and the freezing of gas prices at the
    wellhead required by that law. As a baseline, the Company’s
    2001 realized gas price was $1.31 per Mcf as compared to
    $.88, $.66 and $.56 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The unfavorable gas price has acted to discourage gas
    development activities and increased gas demand. Without
    development of gas reserves in Argentina, supplies of gas in the
    country have declined, while demand for gas has been increasing
    due to the resurgence of the Argentine economy and the higher
    cost of alternative fuels. During 2004, gas exports to Chile
    were curtailed at the direction of the Argentine government and
    Argentina entered into an agreement to import gas from Bolivia
    at prices starting at approximately $2.00 per Mcf (at the
    border), including transportation costs. In May 2004, pursuant
    to a decree, the Argentine government approved measures to
    permit producers to renegotiate gas sales contracts, excluding
    those that could affect small residential customers, in
    accordance with scheduled price increases specified in the
    decree. The wellhead prices in the decree increased from a 2004
    range of $.61 to $.78 per Mcf to a range of $.87 to
    $1.04 per Mcf after July 2005, depending on the region
    where the gas is produced. No further gas price increases beyond
    July 2005 have occurred. Other than an expectation that gas
    prices will be permitted to increase gradually over time, as has
    already been demonstrated by the governing authorities, no
    specific predictions can be made about the future of gas prices
    in Argentina. However, the Company expects Argentine gas
    realizations to be less than gas realizations in the United
    States.



Canada.

The Company views the operating
    environment in Canada as stable and the economic stability as
    good. A portion of the Company’s Canadian revenues and
    substantially all of its costs are denominated in Canadian
    dollars. While the value of the Canadian dollar does fluctuate
    in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company believes that
    any currency risk associated with its Canadian operations would
    not have a material impact on the Company’s results of
    operations.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s primary risk
    exposures associated with financial instruments to which it is a
    party include oil and gas price volatility, volatility in the
    exchange rates of the Canadian dollar and Argentine peso vis
    á vis the U.S. dollar and interest rate volatility.
    The Company’s primary risk exposures associated with
    financial instruments have not changed significantly since
    December 31, 2005.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Pioneer Natural Resources Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Pioneer Natural Resources Company (the “Company”) as
    of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, cash flows
    and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
    consolidated financial position of the Company at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
    criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 15, 2006 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial
    statements, in 2003 the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations.”

NOTES
    TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31,
    2005, 2004 and 2003

NOTE A.

Organization
    and Nature of Operations

Pioneer Natural Resources Company (“Pioneer” or the
    “Company”) is a Delaware corporation whose common
    stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The
    Company is a large independent oil and gas exploration and
    production company with operations in the United States,
    Argentina, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, South Africa and
    Tunisia.

On September 28, 2004, the Company completed a merger with
    Evergreen Resources, Inc. (“Evergreen”) that added to
    the Company’s United States and Canadian asset base and
    expanded its portfolio of development and exploration
    opportunities in North America. Evergreen’s operations were
    primarily focused on developing and expanding its coal bed
    methane production from the Raton Basin in southern Colorado.

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141,
    “Business Combinations”, the merger has been accounted
    for as a purchase of Evergreen by Pioneer. As a result, the
    financial statements for the Company prior to September 28,
    2004 are those of Pioneer only. The accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows include the financial results of Evergreen since
    October 1, 2004. See Note C for additional information
    regarding the Evergreen merger.

NOTE B.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation.

The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
    Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries
    since their acquisition or formation. The Company
    proportionately consolidates less than 100 percent-owned
    affiliate partnerships, which it serves as general partner
    through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, involved in
    oil and gas producing activities in accordance with Emerging
    Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Abstract Issue

No. 00-1,

“Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under
    the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and
    Other Ventures”. The Company owns less than a
    20 percent interest in the oil and gas partnerships that it
    proportionately consolidates. All material intercompany balances
    and transactions have been eliminated.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, other liabilities and
    minority interests in the Company’s Consolidated Balance
    Sheets includes $9.3 million and $8.7 million,
    respectively, related to majority-owned subsidiaries, which are
    related to activities in the United States and Nigeria. The
    minority interest in the net income of the United States related
    subsidiaries was $3.5 million and $.9 million for 2005
    and 2004, respectively, and is included in other expense in the
    Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
    minority interest in the net loss of the Nigerian subsidiary was
    $5.2 million for 2005 and is included in interest and other
    income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Use of estimates in the preparation of financial
    statements.

Preparation of the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally
    accepted accounting principles in the United States requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting periods. Depletion of oil and gas
    properties and impairment of goodwill, in part, is determined
    using estimates of proved oil and gas reserves. There are
    numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities
    of proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of
    production and the timing of development expenditures.
    Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil
    and gas properties are subject to numerous uncertainties
    including, among others, estimates of future recoverable
    reserves; commodity price outlooks; foreign laws, restrictions
    and currency exchange rates; and export and excise taxes. Actual
    results could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized.

Argentina devaluation.

Early in January
    2002, the Argentine government severed the direct

one-to-one

U.S. dollar to Argentine peso relationship that had existed
    for many years. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
    Company used exchange rates of 3.03 pesos to $1 and 2.98 pesos
    to $1, respectively, to remeasure the peso-



PIONEER
    NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31,
    2005, 2004 and 2003

denominated monetary assets and liabilities of the
    Company’s Argentine subsidiaries. The remeasurement of the
    peso-denominated monetary net assets of the Company’s
    Argentine subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and
    2003 resulted in gains of $.2 million and $.2 million
    and a charge of $.3 million, respectively.

As a result of certain Argentine stability laws and regulations
    enacted since the devaluation of the Argentine peso that impact
    the price the Company receives for the oil and gas it produces,
    the Company continually reviews its Argentine proved and
    unproved properties for impairment. Based on (i) the
    Company’s announced sales price for its Argentine assets,
    as more fully discussed in Note W and (ii) estimates
    of future commodity prices and operating costs, the Company
    believes that the future cash flows from its Argentine oil and
    gas assets will be sufficient to fully recover its proved
    property basis. Based upon the announced sales price for the
    Argentine assets, the Company does not believe it has an
    impairment of its unproved properties. If the sale is
    unsuccessful, the Company intends to continue its exploration
    efforts on all of its remaining unproved acreage. Based upon the
    Company’s improved economic outlook for Argentina during
    2005, the Company increased its capital budget for exploration
    and development activities in 2005 as compared to the capital
    budgets in 2004 and 2003.

While the Argentine economic and political situation continues
    to improve, the Argentine government may enact future
    regulations or policies that, when finalized and adopted, may
    materially impact, among other items, (i) the realized
    prices the Company receives for the commodities it produces and
    sells, (ii) the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow
    to the Company’s corporate headquarters in the United
    States, (iii) the Company’s asset valuations,
    (iv) the Company’s level of future investments in
    Argentina and (v) peso-denominated monetary assets and
    liabilities. While conditions are improving, numerous
    uncertainties exist surrounding the ultimate resolution of
    Argentina’s economic and political stability.

Cash equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash on hand and depository accounts held by
    banks.

Investments.

Investments in
    unaffiliated equity securities that have a readily determinable
    fair value are classified as “trading securities” if
    management’s current intent is to hold them for the near
    term; otherwise, they are accounted for as

“available-for-sale”

securities. The Company reevaluates the classification of
    investments in unaffiliated equity securities at each balance
    sheet date. The carrying value of trading securities and

available-for-sale

securities are adjusted to fair value as of each balance sheet
    date.

Unrealized holding gains are recognized for trading securities
    in interest and other income, and unrealized holding losses are
    recognized in other expense during the periods in which changes
    in fair value occur.

Unrealized holding gains and losses are recognized for

available-for-sale

securities as credits or charges to stockholders’ equity
    and other comprehensive income (loss) during the periods in
    which changes in fair value occur. Realized gains and losses on
    the divestiture of

available-for-sale

securities are determined using the average cost method. The
    Company had no investments in

available-for-sale

securities as of December 31, 2005 or 2004.

Investments in unaffiliated equity securities that do not have a
    readily determinable fair value are measured at the lower of
    their original cost or the net realizable value of the
    investment. The Company had no significant equity security
    investments that did not have a readily determinable fair value
    as of December 31, 2005 or 2004.

Inventories.

Inventories were comprised
    of $77.3 million and $37.9 million of materials and
    supplies and $2.4 million and $2.4 million of
    commodities as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    The Company’s materials and supplies inventory is primarily
    comprised of oil and gas drilling or repair items such as
    tubing, casing, chemicals, operating supplies and ordinary
    maintenance materials and parts. The materials and supplies
    inventory is primarily acquired for use in future drilling
    operations or repair operations and is carried at the lower of
    cost or market, on a

first-in,

first-out basis. Commodities inventory is carried at the lower
    of average cost or market, on a

first-in,

first-out basis. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
    Company’s materials and supplies inventory was net of
    $.2 million and $.4 million, respectively, of
    valuation reserve allowances.

Oil and gas properties.

The Company
    utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil
    and gas properties. Under this method, all costs associated with
    productive wells and nonproductive development wells are
    capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological
    and geophysical expenditures are expensed. The Company
    capitalizes interest on expenditures for significant development
    projects until such projects are ready for their intended use.

The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an
    exploratory well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets
    for more than one year following the completion of drilling
    unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas reserves in an
    area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the
    following conditions are met:

(i)

The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify
    its completion as a producing well.

(ii)

The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves
    and the economic and operating viability of the project.

Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical
    location of certain Alaskan, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and
    foreign projects, it may take the Company longer than one year
    to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and
    economics associated with making a determination on its
    commercial viability. In these instances, the project’s
    feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or
    advances in technology, but rather the Company’s ongoing
    efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the
    hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information, gaining
    access to other companies’ production, transportation or
    processing facilities

and/or

getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells.
    These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly.
    Consequently, the Company’s assessment of suspended
    exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be
    made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial
    and is impaired. See Note D for additional information
    regarding the Company’s suspended exploratory well cost and
    “New accounting pronouncements” below for information
    regarding the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Position

No. FAS 19-1,

“Accounting for Suspended Well Costs” (“FSP

FAS 19-1”).

The Company owns interests in 12 natural gas processing plants
    and three treating facilities. The Company operates eight of the
    plants and all three treating facilities. The Company’s
    ownership interests in the natural gas processing plants and
    treating facilities is primarily to accommodate handling the
    Company’s gas production and thus are considered a
    component of the capital and operating costs of the respective
    fields that they service. To the extent that there is excess
    capacity at a plant or treating facility, the Company attempts
    to process third party gas volumes for a fee to keep the plant
    or treating facility at capacity. All revenues and expenses
    derived from third party gas volumes processed through the
    plants and treating facilities are reported as components of oil
    and gas production costs. The third party revenues generated
    from the plant and treating facilities for the three years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $58.1 million,
    $45.9 million and $39.5 million, respectively. The
    third party expenses attributable to the plants and treating
    facilities for the same respective periods were
    $18.0 million, $11.9 million and $11.3 million.
    The capitalized costs of the plants and treating facilities are
    included in proved oil and gas properties and are depleted using
    the

unit-of-production

method along with the other capitalized costs of the field that
    they service.

Capitalized costs relating to proved properties are depleted
    using the

unit-of-production

method based on proved reserves. Costs of significant
    nonproducing properties, wells in the process of being drilled
    and development projects are excluded from depletion until such
    time as the related project is completed and proved reserves are
    established or, if unsuccessful, impairment is determined.

Proceeds from the sales of individual properties and the
    capitalized costs of individual properties sold or abandoned are
    credited and charged, respectively, to accumulated depletion,
    depreciation and amortization. Generally, no gain or loss is
    recognized until the entire amortization base is sold. However,
    gain or loss is recognized from the sale of less than an entire
    amortization base if the disposition is significant enough to
    materially impact the depletion rate of the remaining properties
    in the amortization base.



PIONEER
    NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31,
    2005, 2004 and 2003

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
    (“SFAS 144”), the Company reviews its long-lived
    assets to be held and used, including proved oil and gas
    properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of
    accounting, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An
    impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected future
    cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. In
    this circumstance, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for
    the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
    estimated fair value of the asset.

Unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed for
    impairment on a

project-by-project

basis. The impairment assessment is affected by the results of
    exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future
    sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. If the
    quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is
    not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each
    project, the Company will recognize an impairment loss at that
    time by recording an allowance.

Goodwill.

As described in Note C,
    the Company recorded $327.8 million of goodwill associated
    with the Evergreen merger. The goodwill was recorded to the
    Company’s United States reporting unit. In accordance with
    EITF Abstract Issue

No. 00-23,

“Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation
    under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation
    No. 44”, the Company has reduced goodwill by
    $16.2 million since September 28, 2004 for tax
    benefits associated with the exercise of fully-vested stock
    options assumed in conjunction with the Evergreen merger. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”, goodwill is not amortized to earnings,
    but is assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
    indicate that impairment of the carrying value of goodwill is
    likely, but no less often than annually. If the carrying value
    of goodwill is determined to be impaired, it is reduced for the
    impaired value with a corresponding charge to pretax earnings in
    the period in which it is determined to be impaired. During the
    third quarter of 2005, the Company performed its annual
    assessment of impairment of the goodwill and determined that
    there was no impairment.

Other property, plant and equipment,
    net.

Other property, plant and equipment is
    stated at cost and primarily consists of items such as heavy
    equipment and rigs, furniture and fixtures and leasehold
    improvements. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful
    life of the assets using the straight-line method. At
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, other property, plant and
    equipment was net of accumulated depreciation of
    $131.5 million and $112.3 million, respectively.

Asset retirement obligations.

The
    Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance
    with SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS 143”), which
    was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2003.
    SFAS 143 amended SFAS No. 19, “Financial
    Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing
    Companies” (“SFAS 19”) to require that the
    fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
    recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
    estimate of fair value can be made. Under the provisions of
    SFAS 143, asset retirement obligations are capitalized as
    part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset.

As a result of the adoption of SFAS 143, on January 1,
    2003 the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment gain of
    $15.4 million, net of $1.3 million of deferred tax, as
    a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting
    principle in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. See Note L for additional information regarding
    the Company’s asset retirement obligations.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,
    “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,
    an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143”
    (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 clarifies that
    conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of
    liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair
    values can be reasonably estimated. The interpretation was
    adopted by the Company on December 31, 2005. The adoption
    of FIN 47 had no impact on the Company’s financial
    position or results of operations.

Derivatives and hedging.

The Company
    follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (“SFAS 133”). SFAS 133 requires the
    accounting recognition of all derivative instruments as either
    assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivative instruments that
    are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net
    income. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, the Company may
    designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to
    changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an
    identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular
    risk (a “fair value hedge”) or as hedging the exposure
    to variability in expected future cash flows that are
    attributable to a particular risk (a “cash flow
    hedge”). Both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing
    basis, a fair value hedge must be expected to be highly
    effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value
    attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a hedge
    is designated. Similarly, a cash flow hedge must be expected to
    be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows
    attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge.
    The expectation of hedge effectiveness must be supported by
    matching the essential terms of the hedged asset, liability or
    forecasted transaction to the derivative hedge contract or by
    effectiveness assessments using statistical measurements. The
    Company’s policy is to assess hedge effectiveness at the
    end of each calendar quarter.

Under the provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value
    of derivative instruments that are fair value hedges are offset
    against changes in the fair value of the hedged assets,
    liabilities, or firm commitments through net income. Effective
    changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are
    cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) — net deferred hedge

    derivative transactions in which the Company participates.

Environmental.

The Company’s
    environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending
    on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an
    existing condition caused by past operations and that have no
    future economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend
    the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future
    environmental contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are
    recorded when environmental

remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably
    estimated. Such liabilities are undiscounted unless the timing
    of cash payments for the liability are fixed or reliably
    determinable.

Treasury stock.

Treasury stock
    purchases are recorded at cost. Upon reissuance, the cost of
    treasury shares held is reduced by the average purchase price
    per share of the aggregate treasury shares held.

Revenue recognition.

The Company does
    not recognize revenues until they are realized or realizable and
    earned. Revenues are considered realized or realizable and
    earned when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered, (iii) the seller’s price to the buyer is
    fixed or determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably
    assured.

The Company uses the entitlements method of accounting for oil,
    natural gas liquid (“NGL”) and gas revenues. Sales
    proceeds in excess of the Company’s entitlement are
    included in other liabilities and the Company’s share of
    sales taken by others is included in other assets in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company had no material oil or NGL entitlement assets or
    liabilities as of December 31, 2005 or 2004. The following
    table presents the Company’s gas entitlement assets and
    liabilities and their associated volumes as of December 31,

Stock-based compensation.

The Company
    has a long-term incentive plan (the “Long-Term Incentive
    Plan”) under which the Company grants stock-based
    compensation. The Long-Term Incentive Plan is described more
    fully in Note H. The Company accounts for stock-based
    compensation granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan using
    the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles
    Bulletin Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”) and related
    interpretations. Stock-based compensation expense associated
    with option grants was not recognized in the determination of
    the Company’s net income during the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, as all options granted
    under the Long-Term Incentive Plan had exercise prices equal to
    the market value of the underlying common stock on the dates of
    grant or were issued in exchange for fully-vested Evergreen
    options as purchase consideration in the Evergreen merger.
    Stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted
    stock awards is deferred and amortized to earnings ratably over
    the vesting periods of the awards. See “New accounting
    pronouncements” below for information regarding the
    Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised

Foreign currency translation.

The
    U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the
    Company’s international operations except Canada.
    Accordingly, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a
    foreign currency are remeasured to U.S. dollars at the
    exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period;
    revenues and costs and expenses denominated in a foreign
    currency are remeasured at the average of the exchange rates
    that were in effect during the period in which the revenues and
    costs and expenses were recognized. The resulting gains or
    losses from remeasuring foreign currency denominated balances
    into U.S. dollars are recorded in other income or other
    expense, respectively. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured at the historic
    exchange rates that were in effect when the assets or
    liabilities were acquired or incurred.

The functional currency of the Company’s Canadian
    operations is the Canadian dollar. The financial statements of
    the Company’s Canadian subsidiary entities are translated
    to U.S. dollars as follows: all assets and liabilities are
    translated using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each
    reporting period; revenues and costs and expenses are translated
    using the average of the exchange rates that were in effect
    during the period in which the revenues and costs and expenses
    were recognized. The resulting gains or losses from translating

non-U.S. dollar

denominated balances are recorded in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the
    period through accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) — cumulative translation adjustment.

New accounting pronouncements.

The
    following discussions provide information about new accounting
    pronouncements that have been issued by the FASB:

SFAS 123(R).

In December 2004, the FASB
    issued SFAS 123(R), which is a revision of SFAS 123.
    SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB 25 and amends
    SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows”.
    Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the
    approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R)
    will require all share-based payments to employees, including
    grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as
    stock-based compensation expense in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their fair
    values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

SFAS 123(R) must be adopted no later than January 1,
    2006 and permits public companies to adopt its requirements
    using one of two methods:

•

A “modified prospective” method in which compensation
    cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on
    the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based
    payments granted after the adoption date and based on the
    requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to
    employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123(R) that
    remain unvested on the adoption date.

•

A “modified retrospective” method which includes the
    requirements of the modified prospective method described above,
    but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods
    presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based
    on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS 123 for
    purposes of pro forma disclosures.

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) on
    January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company accounted for
    share-based payments to employees prior to January 1, 2006
    using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 and
    related interpretations. As such, the Company generally did not
    recognize compensation expense associated with employee stock
    option grants. The Company has not issued stock options to
    employees since 2003. Consequently, the adoption of
    SFAS 123(R)’s fair value method will not have a
    significant impact on the Company’s future results of
    operations or financial position. Had the Company adopted
    SFAS 123(R) in prior periods, the impact would have
    approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as described in the pro
    forma disclosures above. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) will
    have no effect on future results of operations related to the
    Company’s unvested outstanding restricted stock awards. The
    Company estimates that the adoption of SFAS 123(R), based
    on estimated outstanding unvested stock options, will result in
    compensation charges of approximately $1.0 million during
    2006.



PIONEER
    NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31,
    2005, 2004 and 2003

The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
    “ESPP”) that allows eligible employees to annually
    purchase the Company’s common stock at a discount. The
    provisions of SFAS 123(R) will cause the ESPP to be a
    compensatory plan. However, the change in accounting for the
    ESPP is not expected to have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position, future results of operations
    or liquidity. Historically, the ESPP compensatory amounts have
    been nominal. See Note H for additional information
    regarding the ESPP.

SFAS 123(R) also requires that tax benefits in excess of
    recognized compensation expenses be reported as a financing cash
    flow, rather than an operating cash flow as required under prior
    literature. This requirement may serve to reduce the
    Company’s future cash flows from operating activities and
    increase future cash flows from financing activities, to the
    extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the
    future.

FSP

FAS 19-1.

In
    April 2005, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 19-1.

FSP

FAS 19-1

amended SFAS 19, to allow continued capitalization of
    exploratory well costs beyond one year from the completion of
    drilling under circumstances where the well has found a
    sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
    producing well and the enterprise is making sufficient progress
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
    of the project. FSP

FAS 19-1

also amended SFAS 19 to require enhanced disclosures of
    suspended exploratory well costs in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted the new
    requirements during the second quarter of 2005. See Note D
    for additional information regarding the Company’s
    exploratory well costs. The adoption of FSP

FAS 19-1

did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

NOTE C.  Acquisitions

Evergreen merger.

On September 28,
    2004, Pioneer completed a merger with Evergreen, with Pioneer
    being the surviving corporation for accounting purposes. The
    transaction was accounted for as a purchase of Evergreen by
    Pioneer. The merger with Evergreen was accomplished through the
    issuance of 25.4 million shares of Pioneer common stock and
    $851.1 million of cash paid to Evergreen shareholders at
    closing, net of $12.1 million of acquired cash. The cash
    consideration paid in the merger was financed through borrowings
    on the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facilities. See
    Note F for additional information regarding the credit
    facilities.

The Company recorded $327.8 million of goodwill associated
    with the Evergreen merger, which represented the excess of the
    purchase consideration over the net fair value of the
    identifiable net assets acquired.

The following discussion describes the history and status of

Ozona Deep.

The Company’s Ozona
    Deep exploration well was drilled during 2002 and found
    quantities of oil believed to be commercial; however, given its
    location in the Gulf of Mexico, it is necessary to have a signed
    production handling agreement (“PHA”) with
    infrastructure in the area to insure the economics associated
    with the



PIONEER
    NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO

discovery prior to doing further appraisal drilling. During the
    third quarter of 2005, Pioneer and the operator of Ozona Deep
    signed a Capacity Commitment Agreement with a third party
    platform to bring future production from the discovery to the
    third party’s platform. The Company anticipates entering
    into a PHA in 2006 and drilling an appraisal well during 2006.

Oooguruk.

During 2003, the
    Company’s Alaskan Oooguruk discovery wells found quantities
    of oil believed to be commercial. In 2003, the Company began
    farm-in discussions with the owner of undeveloped discoveries in
    adjacent acreage given its proximity and the potential cost
    benefits of a larger scale project. The farm-in was completed
    during 2004. Along with completing the farm-in agreement,
    Pioneer obtained access to exploration well and seismic data to
    improve the Company’s understanding of the potential of the
    discoveries without having to drill additional wells. In late
    2004, the Company completed an extensive technical and economic
    evaluation of the resource potential within this area and
    authorized a front-end engineering design study (“FEED
    study”) for the area which was completed.

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company sanctioned the
    development of the discovery and obtained the necessary
    regulatory approvals. The Company will begin operations to
    install an offshore gravel drilling and production site in order
    to complete gravel hauling activities during the 2006 winter
    construction season. Following construction of the gravel
    drilling and production site, a subsea flowline and facilities
    will be installed during 2007 to carry produced liquids to
    existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk River
    Unit. Pioneer plans to drill approximately 40 horizontal wells
    to develop the discovery. Depending on weather conditions and
    facilities completion and accessibility, drilling could begin as
    early as the fall of 2007.

Thunder Hawk.

During 2004, the
    Company’s initial Thunder Hawk well found quantities of oil
    believed to be commercial. Additional appraisal wells were
    determined necessary to confirm the commercialization of the
    discovery. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the third appraisal
    well was spudded and plans to complete the drilling of the
    previously spudded second well, which was temporarily suspended
    due to weather. Completion of the drilling is expected in the
    first half of 2006.

South Africa.

During 2001, the Company
    drilled two South African discovery wells that found quantities
    of gas and condensate believed to be commercial. During 2004,
    2003 and 2002, the Company actively reviewed the gas supply and
    demand fundamentals in South Africa and had discussions with a

gas-to-liquids

(“GTL”) plant in the area to purchase the condensate
    and gas. During 2004, a FEED study was authorized for the gas
    development and infrastructure design. The FEED study was
    completed in early 2005 and based on that study, the GTL plant
    operator initiated purchase orders for long-lead time
    infrastructure components. In December 2005, the Company
    announced the final approvals with its partner in the South
    Coast gas project to commence the initial development of the
    project. The project will include subsea tie-back of gas from
    the Sable field and six additional gas accumulations to the
    existing production facilities on the F-A platform for
    transportation via existing pipelines to the GTL plant.
    Production is expected to begin during the second half of 2007.
    Additional development drilling related to the project is
    expected to commence in the first quarter of 2006. As a result,
    the Company added 11.4 MBOE of reserves in 2005 and reduced
    the suspended exploratory costs by approximately
    $6.2 million.

At December 31, 2005, the remaining costs associated with
    this project relate to the Boomslang discovery, which was not
    included in the initial development of this project. Boomslang
    is both an oil and gas discovery. Continued studies of the
    commercialization of the project are ongoing. Part of the
    ongoing efforts is determining the commercialization of the
    discovery as an oil project, gas project or both. If
    commercialized as an oil discovery, earliest production would be
    2009 and if commercialized as a gas discovery, earliest
    production would be 2012.

Tunisia — Anaguid.

During
    2003, the Company drilled two exploration wells on its Anaguid
    Block in Tunisia which found quantities of condensate and gas
    believed to be commercial. During 2004, the wells were scheduled
    and approved for extended production tests. However, the project
    operator delayed the extended



PIONEER
    NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

production tests due to issues unrelated to the Company or the
    project. In the third quarter of 2005, the project operator,
    along with the Company, conducted an extended production test of
    one of the two existing exploration wells and drilled an offset
    appraisal well to the other exploration well.

The results of the extended production test were unfavorable and
    the Company expensed the costs associated with this well in the
    third quarter of 2005, which were approximately
    $5.1 million. However, the appraisal well offsetting the
    second discovery encountered gas and condensate in a similar
    horizon to the initial well. The Company is currently reviewing
    data from the appraisal well to determine whether development of
    the area is economical.

The carrying amounts

    short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the

    was determined based on underlying market rates of interest. The
    current portion of the

Long-term debt.

The carrying amount of
    borrowings outstanding under the Company’s corporate credit

    interest at variable market rates. The fair values of each of
    the senior note issuances were determined based on quoted market
    prices for each of the issues. See Note F for additional
    information regarding the Company’s long-term debt.

Lines of credit.

During September 2005,
    the Company entered into an Amended and Restated

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit
    Agreement”) that amended the Company’s
    $700 million

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement. In connection with funding of the
    Amended Credit Agreement, all amounts outstanding under a

364-day

credit facility, which was established to fund the Evergreen
    merger in September 2004, were retired and the

364-day

credit facility terminated. The Amended Credit Agreement matures
    in September 2010 unless extended in accordance with the terms
    of the Amended Credit Agreement. The terms of the Amended Credit
    Agreement provide for initial aggregate loan commitments of
    $1.5 billion, which may be

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

increased to a maximum aggregate amount of $1.8 billion if
    the lenders increase their loan commitments or if loan
    commitments of new financial institutions are added to the
    Amended Credit Agreement.

Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement may be in the form
    of revolving loans or swing line loans. Aggregate outstanding
    swing line loans may not exceed $100 million. Revolving
    loans bear interest, at the option of the Company, based on
    (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate
    announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank
    (7.25 percent per annum at December 31, 2005) or
    the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds
    transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during
    the last preceding business day (4.09 percent per annum at
    December 31, 2005) plus .5 percent or (b) a base
    Eurodollar rate, substantially equal to LIBOR (4.84 percent
    per annum at December 31, 2005), plus a margin (the
    “Applicable Margin”) that is determined by reference
    to a grid based on the Company’s debt rating
    (.75 percent per annum at December 31, 2005). The
    Applicable Margin is increased by .10 percent to
    .125 percent per annum, depending on the Company’s
    debt ratings, if total borrowings under the Amended Credit
    Agreement exceed 50 percent of the aggregate loan
    commitments. Swing line loans bear interest at a rate per annum
    equal to the “ASK” rate for Federal funds periodically
    published by the Dow Jones Market Service plus the Applicable
    Margin. The Company pays commitment fees on the undrawn amounts
    under the Amended Credit Agreement that are determined by
    reference to a grid based on the Company’s debt rating
    (.125 percent per annum at December 31, 2005).

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $87.8 million
    of undrawn letters of credit, of which $80.3 million were
    undrawn commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. The
    letters of credit outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement
    are subject to a per annum fee, based on a grid of the
    Company’s debt rating, representing the Company’s
    LIBOR margin (4.84 percent at December 31,
    2005) plus .75 percent. As of December 31, 2005,
    the Company had unused borrowing capacity of $519.7 million
    under the Amended Credit Agreement.

In January 2006, Moody’s Investor Services, Inc.
    (“Moody’s”) downgraded the Company from Baa3 to
    Ba1. The downgrade triggered changes in the pricing grid under
    the Amended Credit Agreement. The Applicable Margin and the
    spread on the letters of credit increased from .75 percent
    to 1.00 percent.

The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain financial
    covenants, which include the (i) maintenance of a ratio of
    the Company’s earnings before gain or loss on the
    disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes,
    depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, exploration
    and abandonments expense and other noncash charges and expenses
    to consolidated interest expense of at least 3.5 to 1.0;
    (ii) maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book
    capitalization less intangible assets, accumulated other
    comprehensive income and certain noncash asset impairments not
    to exceed .60 to 1.0; and (iii)  because  the Company fell
    below an investment grade rating by both Moody’s and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, Inc. prior to
    attaining a mid-investment grade rating (as defined in the
    Amended Credit Agreement) by either of such rating agencies,
    then such covenants also include the maintenance of an annual
    ratio of the net present value of the Company’s oil and gas
    properties to total debt of at least 1.50 to 1.0 for the first
    18 months following the date of the Amended Credit
    Agreement, and 1.75 to 1.0 thereafter. The lenders may declare
    any outstanding obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement
    immediately due and payable upon the occurrence, and during the
    continuance of, an event of default, which includes a defined
    change in control of the Company. As of December 31, 2005,
    the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

Senior notes.

The Company’s senior
    notes are general unsecured obligations ranking equally in right
    of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the
    Company and are senior in right of payment to all existing and
    future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Company is
    a holding company that conducts all of its operations through
    subsidiaries; consequently, the senior notes are structurally
    subordinated to all obligations of its subsidiaries. Interest on
    the Company’s senior notes is payable semiannually.

Senior convertible notes.

The
    $100 million of


/


% senior
    convertible notes due 2021 (the “Convertible Notes”)
    are convertible at the option of the holders. If the holders of
    the Convertible Notes do not redeem the Convertible Notes prior
    to December 20, 2006 (the Company’s first redemption
    right) the Company currently intends to exercise its rights
    under the indenture and redeem the Convertible Notes on such
    date for cash, common stock or a combination thereof. If the
    holders do not exercise their rights to convert the Convertible
    Notes prior to December 20, 2006, the Company intends to
    refinance the cash redemption costs with unused borrowing
    capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Convertible
    Notes are reflected in “Thereafter” in the below
    maturities table. Accordingly, the Company has classified the
    Convertible Notes as long-term in its Consolidated Balance Sheet
    as of December 31, 2005.

Each $25.00 principal balance outstanding under the Convertible
    Notes is convertible into .58175 shares of the
    Company’s common stock plus $19.98 per share, which
    includes Evergreen Kansas properties proceeds (as an example,
    each $1,000 of Convertible Notes principal would exchange for
    23.27 shares of the Company’s common stock plus
    $799.20 of cash). The portion of the Convertible Notes
    exchangeable into the Company’s common stock is included in
    the computation of the Company’s average diluted shares
    outstanding.

Early extinguishment of debt.

During
    2005, the Company (i) redeemed the remaining principal
    amounts of its outstanding


/


% senior
    notes due 2010 (the
    “9


/


% Notes”)
    and its


/


% senior
    notes due 2012 (the “7.50% Notes”) of
    $64.0 million and $16.2, respectively, and
    (ii) accepted tenders to purchase for cash
    $188.4 million in principal amount of its


/


% senior
    notes due 2012 (the
    “5


/


% Notes”).
    Consequently, the Company recognized a charge for the early
    extinguishment of debt of $26.5 million included in other
    expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
    Operations on these redemptions and tenders for 2005.

In addition, the Company received sufficient consents from the
    holders of the


/


% Notes
    to permanently remove substantially all of the operating
    restrictions contained in the indenture governing the


/


% Notes.

In conjunction with the 2004 Change of Control Offer provided as
    a result of the merger with Evergreen, the Company repurchased
    $5.5 million of the


/


% Notes
    during 2004. The Company recognized $.1 million of other
    income associated with these debt extinguishments.

During 2003, the Company repurchased $5.1 million of its


/


percent
    senior notes and repaid its former revolving credit agreement
    prior to its scheduled maturity. The Company recognized
    $1.5 million of charges to other expense associated with
    these debt extinguishments.

Retirement
    Plans

Deferred compensation retirement
    plan.

In August 1997, the Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board”)
    approved a deferred compensation retirement plan for the
    officers and certain key employees of the Company. Each officer
    and key employee is allowed to contribute up to 25 percent
    of their base salary and 100 percent of their annual bonus.
    The Company will provide a matching contribution of
    100 percent of the officer’s and key employee’s
    contribution limited to the first 10 percent of the
    officer’s base salary and eight percent of the key
    employee’s base salary. The Company’s matching
    contribution vests immediately. A trust fund has been
    established by the Company to accumulate the contributions made
    under this retirement plan. The Company’s matching
    contributions were $1.2 million, $.9 million and
    $.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively.

401(k) plan.

The Pioneer Natural
    Resources USA, Inc. (“Pioneer USA”) 401(k) and
    Matching Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) is a defined
    contribution plan established under the Internal Revenue Code
    Section 401. All regular full-time and part-time employees
    of Pioneer USA are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan on
    the first day of the month following their date of hire.
    Participants may contribute an amount of not less than two
    percent nor more than 30 percent of their annual salary
    into the 401(k) Plan. Matching contributions are made to the
    401(k) Plan in cash by Pioneer USA in amounts equal to
    200 percent of a participant’s contributions to the
    401(k) Plan that are not in excess of five percent of the
    participant’s base compensation (the “Matching
    Contribution”). Each participant’s account is credited
    with the participant’s contributions, their Matching
    Contributions and allocations of the 401(k) Plan’s
    earnings. Participants are fully vested in their account
    balances except for Matching Contributions and their
    proportionate share of 401(k) Plan earnings attributable to
    Matching Contributions, which proportionately vest over a
    four-year period that begins with the participant’s date of
    hire. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
    2003, the Company recognized compensation expense of
    $8.0 million, $5.4 million and $4.5 million,
    respectively, as a result of Matching Contributions.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plan

In August 1997, the Company’s stockholders approved a
    Long-Term Incentive Plan which provides for the granting of
    incentive awards in the form of stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, performance units and restricted stock to
    directors, officers and employees of the Company. The Long-Term
    Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum number of
    shares of common stock equal to ten percent of the total number
    of shares of common stock equivalents outstanding less the total
    number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards
    under any stock-based plan for the directors, officers or
    employees of the Company.

The following table calculates the number of shares or options
    available for grant under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive

Prior to 2004, the
    Company had a program of awarding semiannual stock options to
    its employees. The Company granted 1,353,988 options under the
    Long-Term Incentive Plan during 2003.

In accordance with the Evergreen merger agreement, on
    September 28, 2004, the Company assumed fully-vested
    options to purchase 2,384,657 shares of the Company’s
    common stock at various exercise prices, the weighted average
    price per share of which was $11.18. The assumed options were
    outstanding awards to Evergreen employees when the Evergreen
    merger occurred.

During 2004, the Company’s stock-based compensation
    philosophy shifted its emphasis from the awarding of stock
    options to restricted stock awards. There were no options
    granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan during 2005 or 2004.

Restricted stock awards.

During 2005,
    the Company issued 1,411,269 restricted shares of the
    Company’s common stock as compensation to directors,
    officers and employees of the Company.

During 2004, the Company assumed 214,186 restricted stock units
    in exchange for Evergreen restricted stock units outstanding on
    September 28, 2004 and issued 630,937 restricted shares of
    the Company’s common stock as compensation to directors,
    officers and employees of the Company. The Company recorded
    $6.0 million of deferred compensation for future expected
    service associated with certain of the restricted stock units
    assumed from Evergreen. The deferred compensation is being
    amortized as charges to compensation expense over the periods in
    which the restrictions on the units lapse.

For the 2005-2006 director year, the Company’s non-employee
    directors were offered a choice to receive their annual fee
    retainers (i) 100 percent in restricted stock units,
    (ii) 100 percent in cash or (iii) a combination
    of 50/50 of cash and restricted stock units. All non-employee
    directors also received an annual equity grant of restricted
    stock units.

During 2003, the Company issued 77,625 restricted shares of the
    Company’s common stock. The restricted share awards were
    issued as compensation to directors, officers and key employees
    of the Company.

The Company recorded $56.2 million, $19.1 million and
    $1.1 million of deferred compensation associated with
    restricted stock awards in stockholders’ equity during
    2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Such amounts will be
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting periods of
    the awards. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, amortization of
    restricted stock awards of $26.9 million,
    $12.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively, was
    recognized as compensation expense.

The following table reflects the outstanding restricted stock

SFAS 123 disclosures.

The Company
    applied APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting
    for its stock option awards. Accordingly, no compensation
    expense has been recognized for its stock option awards. If
    compensation expense for the stock option awards had been
    determined consistent with SFAS 123, the Company’s net
    income and earnings per share would have been less than the
    reported amounts.

Under SFAS 123, the fair value of each stock option grant
    is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The Company did not grant any stock options
    during the years ended December 31,

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

As discussed above in Note B, the Company has an ESPP that
    allows eligible employees to annually purchase the
    Company’s common stock at a discounted price. Officers of
    the Company are not eligible to participate in the ESPP.
    Contributions to the ESPP are limited to 15 percent of an
    employee’s pay (subject to certain ESPP limits) during the
    nine-month offering period. Participants in the ESPP purchase
    the Company’s common stock at a price that is
    15 percent below the closing sales price of the
    Company’s common stock on either the first day or the last
    day of each offering period, whichever closing sales price is
    lower.

Postretirement
    Benefit Obligations

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had recorded
    $18.6 million and $15.5 million, respectively, of
    unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations, the
    current and noncurrent portions of which are included in other
    current liabilities and other liabilities and minority
    interests, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. These obligations are comprised of five plans of
    which four relate to predecessor entities that the Company
    acquired in prior years. These plans had no assets as of
    December 31, 2005 or 2004. Other than the Company’s
    retirement plan, the participants of these plans are not current
    employees of the Company.

As of December 31, 2005, the accumulated postretirement
    benefit obligations pertaining to these plans were determined by
    independent actuaries for four plans representing
    $14.4 million of unfunded accumulated postretirement
    benefit obligations and by the Company for one plan representing
    $4.2 million of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligations. Interest costs at an annual rate of
    5.75 percent of the periodic undiscounted accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligations were employed in the
    valuations of the benefit obligations. Certain of the
    aforementioned plans provide for medical and dental cost
    subsidies for plan participants. Annual medical cost escalation
    trends of 10.0 percent in 2006, declining to
    5.0 percent in 2011 and thereafter, and annual dental cost
    escalation trends of 6.5 percent in 2006, declining to
    5.0 percent in 2009 and thereafter, were employed to
    estimate the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
    associated with the medical and dental cost subsidies.

The following table reconciles changes in the Company’s
    unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations during
    the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:

NOTE I.  Commitments
    and Contingencies

Severance agreements.

The Company has
    entered into severance and change in control agreements with its
    officers, subsidiary company officers and certain key employees.
    Salaries and bonuses for the Company’s officers are set by
    the Board for the parent company officers and by the
    Company’s management committee for subsidiary company
    officers and key employees. The Board and management committee
    can grant increases or reductions to base salary at their
    discretion. The current annual salaries for the parent company
    officers, the subsidiary company officers and key employees
    covered under such agreements total $33.2 million.

Indemnifications.

The Company has
    indemnified its directors and certain of its officers, employees
    and agents with respect to claims and damages arising from acts
    or omissions taken in such capacity, as well as with respect to
    certain litigation.

Legal actions.

The Company is party to
    the legal proceedings that are described below. The Company is
    also party to other proceedings and claims incidental to its
    business. While many of these matters involve inherent
    uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the
    liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to such
    other proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position as
    a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual
    results of operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its
    litigation matters on a

quarter-by-quarter

basis and will adjust its litigation reserves as appropriate to
    reflect its assessment of the then current status of litigation.

Alford.

The Company is party to a 1993 class
    action lawsuit filed in the 26th Judicial District Court of
    Stevens County, Kansas by two classes of royalty owners, one for
    each of the Company’s gathering systems connected to the
    Company’s Satanta gas plant. The case was relatively
    inactive for several years. In early 2000, the plaintiffs
    amended their pleadings and the case now contains two material
    claims. First, the plaintiffs assert that they were improperly
    charged expenses (primarily field compression), which plaintiffs
    allege are a “cost of production”, and for which the
    plaintiffs claim they, as royalty owners, are not responsible.
    Second, the plaintiffs claim they are entitled to
    50 percent to 100 percent of the value of the helium
    extracted at the Company’s Satanta gas plant. If the
    plaintiffs were to prevail on the above two claims in their
    entirety, it is possible that the Company’s liability (both
    for periods covered by the lawsuit and from the last date
    covered by the lawsuit to the present — because
    the deductions continue to be taken and the plaintiffs continue
    to be paid for a royalty share of the helium) could reach
    approximately $35 million related to the cost of production
    claim and approximately $18 million to $43 million
    related to the helium claim, plus prejudgment interest. However,
    the Company believes it has valid defenses to the
    plaintiffs’ claims and has paid the plaintiffs properly
    under their respective oil and gas leases and other agreements,
    and intends to vigorously defend itself.

The Company does not believe the costs it has deducted are a
    “cost of production”. The costs being deducted are
    post production costs incurred to transport the gas to the
    Company’s Satanta gas plant for processing, where the
    valuable hydrocarbon liquids and helium are extracted from the
    gas. The plaintiffs benefit from such extractions and the
    Company believes that charging the plaintiffs with their
    proportionate share of such transportation and processing
    expenses is consistent with Kansas law and with the
    parties’ agreements.

The Company has also vigorously defended against
    plaintiffs’ claims for 100 percent of the value of the
    helium extracted, and believes that in accordance with
    applicable law, it has properly accounted to the plaintiffs for
    their fractional royalty share of the helium under the specified
    royalty clauses of the respective oil and gas leases. In more
    recent filings with the court, plaintiffs asserted that an equal
    division between Pioneer and its royalty owners of the proceeds
    from helium would provide the most equitable result. The Company
    has not established a provision for the helium claim.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31,
    2005, 2004 and 2003

The factual evidence in the case was presented to the
    26th Judicial District Court without a jury in December
    2001. Oral arguments were heard by the court in April 2002, and
    although the court has not yet entered a judgment or findings,
    it could do so at any time. The Company strongly denies the
    existence of any material underpayment to the plaintiffs and
    believes it presented strong evidence at trial to support its
    positions. However, either through a negotiated settlement or
    court ruling, the Company could have to pay some part of the
    cost of production claim and, accordingly, the Company has
    established a partial reserve for this claim. Although the
    amount of any resulting liability, to the extent that it exceeds
    the Company’s provision, could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s results of operations for the
    quarterly reporting period in which such liability is recorded,
    the Company does not expect that any such additional liability
    will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital
    resources or future annual results of operations.

MOSH Holding.

The Company and its principal
    United States subsidiary, Pioneer USA, were named as defendants
    in

MOSH Holding, L.P. v Pioneer Natural Resources Company;
    Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc.; Woodside Energy (USA) Inc.;
    and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, as Trustee of the Mesa Offshore
    Trust

, which was filed on April 11, 2005, in the
    District Court of Travis County, Texas (250th Judicial
    District). The plaintiff is a unitholder in the Mesa Offshore
    Trust, which was created in 1982 as the sole limited partner in
    a partnership that holds an overriding royalty interest in
    certain oil and gas leases offshore Louisiana and Texas. The
    plaintiff alleges that the Company, together with Woodside
    Energy (USA) Inc. (“Woodside”), concealed the value of
    the royalty interest and worked to terminate the Mesa Offshore
    Trust prematurely and to capture for itself and Woodside profits
    that belong to the Mesa Offshore Trust. The plaintiff also
    alleges breaches of fiduciary duty, misapplication of trust
    property, common law fraud, gross negligence, and breach of the
    conveyance agreement for the overriding royalty interest. The
    claims appear to relate principally to farmout arrangements
    established in 2003 for two offshore properties, the Brazos Area
    Block

A-7

and Brazos Area Block

A-39.

The
    relief sought by the plaintiff includes monetary and punitive
    damages and certain equitable relief, including an accounting of
    expenses, a setting aside of certain farmouts, and a temporary
    and permanent injunction. The Company believes the claims are
    without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

Argentine Environmental.

The Company’s
    subsidiary in Argentina is involved in various administrative
    proceedings with environmental authorities in the Neuquen
    Province relating to permits for and discharges from operations
    in that province. The Company’s subsidiary is cooperating
    with the proceedings, although it from time to time challenges
    whether certain assessed fines are appropriate. The Company
    estimates that fines assessed in these proceedings will be
    immaterial, but in the aggregate could exceed $100,000. The
    Company’s subsidiary in Argentina has also been named in a
    suit against various oil companies operating in the Neuquen
    basin entitled

Asociación de Superficiarios de la
    Patagonia v. YPF S.A.

,

et. al.

, originally filed
    on August 21, 2003, in the Argentine National Supreme Court
    of Justice. The plaintiffs, a private group of landowners, have
    also named the national government and several provinces as
    third parties. The lawsuit alleges injury to the environment
    generally by the oil and gas industry without specifically
    alleging how any of the defendants caused this injury. The
    plaintiffs principally seek creation of an insured fund to
    remediate the environment. The Company’s subsidiary intends
    to defend itself in the case. Although the suit is at an early
    procedural stage and appears to involve novel theories, the
    Company does not expect that any such additional liability will
    have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or
    future annual results of operations.

Dorchester Refining Company Site.

A subsidiary
    of the Company has been notified by a letter from the Texas
    Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) dated
    August 24, 2005 that the TCEQ considers the subsidiary to
    be a potentially responsible party with respect to the
    Dorchester Refining Company State Superfund Site located in
    Mount Pleasant, Texas. In connection with the acquisition of oil
    and gas assets in 1991, the Company acquired a group of
    companies, one of which was an entity that had owned a refinery
    located at the Mount Pleasant site from 1977 until 1984.
    According to the TCEQ, this refinery was responsible for
    releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Pursuant
    to applicable Texas law, the Company’s subsidiary, which
    does not own any material assets or conduct any material
    operations, may be subject to strict, joint and several
    liability for the costs of conducting a

study to evaluate potential remedial options and for the costs
    of performing any remediation ultimately required by the TCEQ.
    The Company does not know the nature and extent of the alleged
    contamination, the potential costs of remediation, or the
    portion, if any, of such costs that may be allocable to the
    Company’s subsidiary; however, the Company has noted that
    there appear to be other operators or owners who may share
    responsibility for these costs and does not expect that any such
    additional liability will have a material adverse effect on its
    consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity,
    capital resources or future annual results of operations.

Environmental Protection Agency
    Investigation.

On November 4, 2005, the
    Company learned from the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency that the agency was conducting a criminal investigation
    into a 2003 spill that occurred at a Company-operated drilling
    rig located on an ice island offshore Kuparuk in Harrison Bay,
    Alaska. The investigation is being conducted in conjunction with
    the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Alaska. The
    spill was previously investigated by the Alaska Department of
    Environmental Conservation (“ADEC”) and, following
    completion of a clean up, the ADEC issued a letter stating its
    determination that, at that time, the site did not pose a threat
    to human health, safety, or welfare or the environment. The
    Company is cooperating in the government’s investigation.

Lease agreements.

The Company leases
    offshore production facilities, drilling rigs, equipment and
    office facilities under noncancellable operating leases. Rental
    expenses associated with these operating leases for the years
    ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately
    $64.5 million, $51.8 million and $15.5 million,
    respectively. Future minimum lease commitments under
    noncancellable operating leases at December 31, 2005 are as
    follows (in thousands):

Drilling commitments.

The Company
    periodically enters into contractual arrangements under which
    the Company is committed to expend funds to drill wells in the
    future. The Company also enters into agreements to secure
    drilling rig services, which require the Company to make future
    minimum payments to the rig operators. The Company records
    drilling commitments in the periods in which well capital is
    expended or rig services are provided.

Transportation agreements.

Associated
    with the Evergreen merger, the Company assumed gas
    transportation commitments for specified volumes of gas per year
    through 2014. During 2005, the Company expanded these
    commitments to support production increases, primarily in the
    Raton gas field. The transportation commitments averaged
    approximately 147 million cubic feet (“MMcf”) of
    gross gas sales volumes per day during 2005, including
    associated fuel commitments. These commitments will average
    approximately 196 MMcf of gross gas volumes per day during
    2006, increase to approximately 200 MMcf of gross gas
    volumes per day during 2007, and decline thereafter to
    approximately 41 MMcf of gross gas volumes per day during
    2014.

The Company’s Canadian subsidiaries are parties to pipeline
    transportation service agreements, with aggregate remaining
    terms of approximately 10 years, whereby they have
    committed to transport specified volumes of gas each year
    principally from Canada to a point in Chicago, Illinois. Such
    gas volumes totalled approximately 78 MMcf of gas per day
    during 2005, 2004 and 2003, and are comprised of a significant
    portion of the Company’s Canadian net gas production,
    augmented with certain volumes purchased at market prices in
    Canada. The committed volumes to be transported under the
    pipeline transportation service agreements are approximately
    86 MMcf of gas per day during 2006 and decline to
    approximately 75 MMcf of gas per day by the end of the
    commitment term. The net gas marketing gains or losses resulting
    from purchasing third party gas in

    Operations. Associated with these agreements, the Company
    recognized $4.1 million of gas marketing gains in other
    income during the year ended December 31, 2005 and
    $1.2 million and $.9 million, respectively, of gas
    marketing losses in other expense during the years ended
    December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Fair value hedges.

The Company monitors
    the debt capital markets and interest rate trends to identify
    opportunities to enter into and terminate interest rate swap
    contracts with the objective of reducing costs of capital.
    During the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, the
    Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge a
    portion of the fair value of its senior notes. During the year
    ended December 31, 2004, the Company paid
    $9.4 million, net of $2.2 million of associated
    settlements receivable, to terminate fair value hedge interest
    rate swaps prior to their stated maturities. Associated
    therewith, the Company recognized $11.6 million of
    “Payments of other liabilities” in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended
    December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31,
    2003, the Company terminated fair value hedge interest rate swap
    contracts for cash proceeds, including accrued interest, of
    $21.5 million. The proceeds attributable to the fair value
    of the remaining terms of the terminated contracts amounted to
    $18.3 million and are included in “Proceeds from
    disposition of assets” in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows during the year ended December 31,
    2003. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
    settlements of open fair value hedges reduced the Company’s
    interest expense by $2.2 million and $3.2 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
    was not a party to any open fair value hedges.

As of December 31, 2005, the carrying value of the
    Company’s long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheets included a $4.3 million reduction in the
    carrying value attributable to net deferred hedge losses on
    terminated fair value hedges that are being amortized as net
    increases to interest expense over the original terms of the
    terminated agreements. The amortization of net deferred hedge
    gains on terminated interest rate swaps reduced the
    Company’s reported interest expense by $4.1 million,
    $19.2 million and $26.1 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2005,
    the scheduled amortization of net deferred hedge gains (losses)
    on terminated interest rate hedges (including terminated fair
    value and cash flow hedges) that will be recognized as increases
    in the case of losses, or decreases in the case of gains, to the
    Company’s future interest expense:

    price risk associated with certain capital projects. As of
    December 31, 2005, all of the Company’s open commodity
    hedges are designated as hedges of Canadian and United States
    forecasted sales. The Company also, from time to time, utilizes
    interest rate contracts to reduce the effect of interest rate
    volatility on the Company’s indebtedness and forward
    currency exchange agreements to reduce the effect of
    U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate volatility.

Oil prices.

All material physical sales
    contracts governing the Company’s oil production have been
    tied directly or indirectly to the New York Mercantile Exchange
    (“NYMEX”) prices. As of December 31, 2005, all of
    the Company’s oil hedges were designated as hedges of
    United States forecasted sales. The following table sets forth

Natural gas liquids prices.

During the
    years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company
    did not enter into any NGL hedge contracts. There were no
    outstanding NGL hedge contracts at December 31, 2005.

Gas prices.

The Company employs a
    policy of hedging a portion of its gas production based on the
    index price upon which the gas is actually sold in order to
    mitigate the basis risk between NYMEX prices and actual index
    prices, or based on NYMEX prices if NYMEX prices are highly
    correlated with the index price. As of December 31, 2005,
    all of the Company’s gas hedges were designated as hedges
    of United States and Canadian forecasted sales. The following
    table sets forth the volumes hedged in million British thermal

Hedge ineffectiveness.

During the years
    ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company
    recognized ineffectiveness charges to other expense of
    $54.8 million, $4.3 million and $2.8 million,
    respectively, related to the ineffective portions of its cash
    flow hedging instruments. These charges include amounts related
    to (i) hedged volumes that exceeded revised forecasts of
    production volumes due to delays in the start up of production
    in certain fields and (ii) reduced correlations between the
    indexes of the financial hedge derivatives and the indexes of
    the hedged forecasted production for certain fields.

AOCI — Hedging.

As of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, AOCI — Hedging
    represented net deferred losses of $506.6 and
    $241.4 million, respectively. The
    AOCI — Hedging balance as of December 31,
    2005 was comprised of $767.8 million of net deferred losses
    on the effective portions of open cash flow hedges,
    $30.0 million of net deferred losses on terminated cash
    flow hedges (including $3.2 million of net deferred losses
    on terminated cash flow interest rate hedges) and
    $291.2 million of associated net deferred tax benefits. The
    AOCI — Hedging balance as of December 31,
    2004 was comprised of $363.1 million of net deferred losses
    on the effective portions of open cash flow hedges,
    $3.0 million of net deferred losses on terminated cash flow
    hedges (including $3.4 million of net deferred losses on
    terminated cash flow interest rate hedges) and
    $124.7 million of associated net deferred tax benefits. The
    increase in AOCI — Hedging during the year ended
    December 31, 2005 was primarily attributable to increases
    in future commodity prices relative to the commodity prices
    stipulated in the hedge contracts, partially offset by the
    reclassification of net deferred hedge losses to net income as
    derivatives matured by their terms. The net deferred losses
    associated with open cash flow hedges remain subject to market
    price fluctuations until the positions are either settled under
    the terms of the hedge contracts or terminated prior to
    settlement. The net deferred losses on terminated cash flow
    hedges are fixed.

During the year ending December 31, 2006, based on current
    estimates of future commodity prices, the Company expects to
    reclassify $308.3 million of net deferred losses associated
    with open commodity hedges and $6.2 million of net deferred
    losses on terminated commodity hedges from
    AOCI — Hedging to oil and gas revenues. The
    Company also expects to reclassify approximately
    $114.8 million of net deferred income tax benefits
    associated with commodity hedges during the year ending
    December 31, 2006 from AOCI — Hedging to
    income tax benefit.

Non-hedge derivatives.

During January

    rate swaps. The Company terminated the interest rate swaps
    during January and April 2005 for an aggregate net loss of
    $1.5 million, which amount is included in other expense in
    the Company’s accompanying Consolidated Statement of
    Operations for 2005.

NOTE K.

Major
    Customers and Derivative Counterparties

Sales to major customers.

The
    Company’s share of oil and gas production is sold to
    various purchasers who must be prequalified under the
    Company’s credit risk policies and procedures. The Company
    records allowances for doubtful accounts based on the agings of
    accounts receivable and the general economic condition of its
    customers. The Company is of the opinion that the loss of any
    one purchaser would not have an adverse effect on the ability of
    the Company to sell its oil and gas production.

There were not any customers who individually accounted for ten
    percent or more of the consolidated oil, NGL and gas revenues of
    the Company during the year ended December 31, 2005. The
    following customer individually accounted for ten percent or
    more of the consolidated oil, NGL and gas revenues of the
    Company, including the revenues from discontinued operations and
    the results of commodity hedges, during the years ended

Derivative counterparties.

The Company
    uses credit and other financial criteria to evaluate the credit
    standing of, and to select, counterparties to its derivative
    instruments. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or
    otherwise secure the fair value of its derivative instruments,
    associated credit risk is mitigated by the Company’s credit
    risk policies and procedures. As of December 31, 2005 and
    2004, the Company had $7.3 million of derivative assets for
    which Enron North America Corp was the Company’s
    counterparty. Associated therewith, the Company had a
    $6.4 million allowance for doubtful accounts as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004. In January 2006, the Company
    sold the Enron receivables for $3.0 million and will

Asset
    Divestitures

During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
    the Company completed asset divestitures for net proceeds of
    $1.2 billion, $1.7 million and $35.7 million,

Volumetric production payments.

During
    2005, the Company sold three volumetric production payments
    (“VPPs”) for proceeds of $892.6 million for which
    no gain or loss was recognized. See Note T for additional
    information.

Canadian and Gulf of Mexico Shelf
    divestitures.

During 2005, the Company sold
    its interests in (a) the Martin Creek, Conroy Black and

    prior to their scheduled maturity, hedge derivatives for cash
    sales proceeds of $18.3 million. Net gains from these
    divestitures were deferred and are amortized over the original
    contract lives of the terminated derivatives as reductions to
    interest expense or increases to oil and gas revenues. See

(a)

The Company’s operations in Argentina, Canada and Africa
    periodically recognize monetary assets and liabilities in
    currencies other than their functional currencies (see
    Note B for information regarding the functional currencies
    of subsidiary entities). Associated therewith, the Company
    realizes foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains
    and losses.

NOTE P.  Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”). The Company and
    its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated United States
    federal income tax return. Certain subsidiaries are not eligible
    to be included in the consolidated United States federal income
    tax return and separate provisions for income taxes have been
    determined for these entities or groups of entities. The tax
    returns and the amount of taxable income or loss are subject to
    examination by United States

federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Current
    and estimated tax payments of $44.7 million,
    $17.1 million and $5.3 million were made during the
    years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

SFAS 109 requires that the Company continually assess both
    positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more
    likely than not that deferred tax assets can be realized prior
    to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company-specific, oil and
    gas industry and worldwide economic factors and assesses the
    likelihood that the Company’s net operating loss
    carryforwards (“NOLs”) and other deferred tax
    attributes in the United States, state, local and foreign tax
    jurisdictions will be utilized prior to their expiration. As of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company’s valuation
    allowances related to foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions
    were $95.8 million and $108.2 million, respectively.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the
    “AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a
    deduction of 85 percent of qualified foreign earnings that
    are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. During 2005, the
    Company determined that it was advantageous to apply the
    provisions of the AJCA to qualified foreign earnings that could
    be repatriated. The Company formalized repatriation plans in
    2005 and repatriated $322.5 million from Canada, South
    Africa and Tunisia. Based on the current understanding of the
    provisions of the AJCA, the Company estimates that approximately
    $170.7 million of the repatriated funds qualify for the
    dividend exclusion. The Company is obligated by the provisions
    of the AJCA to invest the qualifying dividends in the United
    States within a reasonable period of time. The cash tax
    liability associated with the qualifying dividends is
    approximately $9.3 million for 2005. During the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company recognized income tax
    expense of $6.8 million related to continuing operations
    and $19.6 million related to discontinued operations
    associated with the repatriations.

The Company’s income tax provision (benefit) and amounts
    separately allocated were attributable to the following items

NOTE Q.

Income
    Per Share From Continuing Operations Before Cumulative Effect of
    Change in Accounting Principle

Basic income per share from continuing operations before
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is computed
    by dividing income from continuing operations before cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle by the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding for the period. The
    computation of diluted income per share from continuing
    operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
    securities or other contracts to issue common stock that are
    dilutive to income from continuing operations before cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle were exercised or
    converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of
    common stock that would then share in the earnings of the
    Company.

The following table is a reconciliation of the basic income from
    continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principle to diluted income from continuing
    operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and

    included in the computations of diluted income per share from
    continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principle for 2004 and 2003, respectively, because
    the exercise prices of the options were greater than the average
    market price of the common shares and would be anti-dilutive to
    the computations.

Geographic
    Operating Segment Information

The Company has operations in only one industry segment, that
    being the oil and gas exploration and production industry;
    however, the Company is organizationally structured along
    geographic operating segments or regions. The Company has
    reportable operations in the United States, Argentina, Canada
    and Africa and Other. Africa and Other is primarily comprised of
    operations in Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Morocco, Nigeria, South
    Africa and Tunisia.

During 2005, the Company sold certain Canadian and United States
    oil and gas properties having carrying values of
    $58.9 million and $31.4 million, respectively, on
    their dates of sale. The results of operations of those
    properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations in
    accordance with SFAS 144 and are excluded from the
    geographic operating segment information provided below. See
    Note V for information regarding the Company’s
    discontinued operations.

The following tables provide the Company’s geographic
    operating segment data required by SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information”, as well as results of operations of oil and
    gas producing activities required by SFAS No. 69,
    “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities”
    as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
    2003. Geographic operating segment income tax benefits
    (provisions) have been determined based on statutory rates
    existing in the various tax jurisdictions where the Company has
    oil and gas producing activities. The “Headquarters”
    table column includes income and expenses that are not routinely
    included in the earnings measures internally reported to
    management on a geographic operating segment basis.

NOTE S.  Impairment
    of Oil and Gas Properties

During October 2004, the Company concluded that a material
    charge for impairment was required under SFAS 144 for its
    Gabonese Olowi field as development of the discovery was
    canceled. Due to significant increases in projected field
    development costs, primarily due to increases in steel costs,
    the project did not offer competitive returns. The Olowi field
    was the Company’s only Gabonese investment. During 2005 and
    2004, the Company recorded an associated impairment charge to
    eliminate the carrying value of the Company’s Gabonese
    Olowi field of $644,000 and $39.7 million, respectively.

NOTE T.  Volumetric
    Production Payments

During January 2005, the Company sold two percent of its total
    proved reserves, or 20.5 million Bbls oil equivalent
    (“MMBOE”) of proved reserves, by means of two VPPs for
    net proceeds of $592.3 million, including the assignment of
    the Company’s obligations under certain derivative hedge
    agreements. Proceeds from the VPPs were



PIONEER
    NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31,
    2005, 2004 and 2003

initially used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. The first
    January VPP sold 58 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) of
    gas volumes over an expected five-year term that began in
    February 2005 for $275.2 million. The second January VPP
    sold 10.8 million Bbls (“MMBbls”) of oil volumes
    over an expected seven-year term that began in January 2006 for
    $317.1 million.

During April 2005, the Company sold less than one percent of its
    total proved reserves, or 7.3 MMBOE of proved reserves, by
    means of a VPP for net proceeds of $300.3 million,
    including the assignment of the Company’s obligations under
    certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the VPP were
    initially used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. The April VPP
    sold 6.0 Bcf of gas volumes over an expected

32-month

term that began in May 2005 and 6.2 MMBbls of oil volumes
    over an expected five-year term that began in January 2006.

The Company’s VPPs represent limited-term overriding
    royalty interests in oil and gas reserves which:
    (i) entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes
    over a period of time from specific lease interests;
    (ii) are free and clear of all associated future production
    costs and capital expenditures; (iii) are nonrecourse to
    the Company (i.e., the purchaser’s only recourse is to the
    assets acquired); (iv) transfers title of the assets to the
    purchaser and (v) allow the Company to retain the assets
    after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered.

Under SFAS 19, a VPP is considered a sale of proved
    reserves. As a result, the Company (i) removed the proved
    reserves associated with the VPPs; (ii) recognized the VPP
    proceeds as deferred revenue which are being amortized on a

unit-of-production

basis to oil and gas revenues over the terms of the VPPs;
    (iii) retained responsibility for 100 percent of the
    production costs and capital costs related to VPP interests and
    (iv) no longer recognizes production associated with the
    VPP volumes.

NOTE U.  Insurance
    Claims

Hurricane Ivan.

During September 2004,
    the Company sustained damages as a result of Hurricane Ivan at
    its Devils Tower and Canyon Express platform facilities in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The damages delayed scheduled well
    completions and interrupted production during the second half of
    2004 and during the first half of 2005. The Company maintains
    business interruption insurance coverage for such circumstances.
    During 2004 and 2005, the Company filed claims with its
    insurance providers for its estimated losses associated with
    Hurricane Ivan.

Based on a settlement agreement between the Company and the
    insurance providers, the Company’s recoverable business
    interruption loss related to Hurricane Ivan is
    $67.0 million. The Company recorded $7.6 million and
    $59.4 million of the claims in the fourth quarter of 2004
    and in the first half of 2005, respectively, in interest and
    other income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Fain Plant.

During May 2005, the
    Company sustained damages as a result of a fire at its Fain gas
    plant in the West Panhandle field. The damages interrupted
    production from mid-May through mid-July of 2005. The Company
    maintains business interruption and physical damage insurance
    coverage for such circumstances and has filed claims with its
    insurance providers. The Company estimates its aggregate Fain
    plant business interruption claims to be approximately
    $19 million to $20 million, of which
    $14.2 million is undisputed by the insurance provider. The
    Company is working to resolve the disputed amounts with the
    insurance provider. The Company recorded $14.2 million of
    the claims in interest and other income in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

During
    August and September 2005, the Company sustained damages as a
    result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita at various facilities in
    the Gulf of Mexico. Other than the East Cameron facility
    discussed further below, the Company believes the damages to the
    facilities are covered by physical damage insurance. The Company
    also maintains business interruption insurance related to
    specifically designated assets in the event there are extended
    periods of revenue interruption.

The Company filed a business interruption claim with its
    insurance provider related to its Devils Tower field resulting
    from its inability to sell production as a result of damages to
    third party facilities. The Company’s business interruption
    claim is expected to cover losses of revenues from mid-October
    2005 (end of

45-day

deductible waiting period) until such point as the third party
    facilities could take the full production from the Devils Tower
    field, which the Company determined to have occurred in early
    December 2005. At December 31, 2005, the Company estimates
    that its business interruption recovery on Devils Tower to be
    $20 million to $24 million. The Company has not
    recorded any estimated recoveries due to certain pending issues
    which the Company expects to have resolved in the near future.

    2005, 2004 and 2003

As a result of Hurricane Rita, the Company’s East Cameron
    facility was destroyed and the Company currently does not plan
    to rebuild the facility based on the current economics of the
    field. The Company is in the process of evaluating the magnitude
    of the loss. Currently, the Company estimates that it will incur
    a minimum of $44 million to reclaim and completely abandon
    the East Cameron facility; thus, the Company recorded an
    additional abandonment obligation of approximately
    $39.8 million in 2005 which is included in exploration and
    abandonments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for
    the year ended December 31, 2005.

The Company filed a claim with its insurance provider regarding
    the loss at East Cameron. Under the Company’s insurance
    policy, the East Cameron facility has the following coverages:
    (a) $14 million of scheduled property value for the
    platform, (b) $4 million of scheduled business
    interruption insurance after a deductible waiting period,
    (c) greater of (1) 25 percent of the scheduled
    property value of the platform or (2) $5 million for
    debris removal coverage, in total, for all assets per occurrence
    and (d) $100 million of “make well safe”
    coverage, in total, for all assets per occurrence.

In December 2005, the Company received the scheduled value for
    the East Cameron assets and recognized a gain of
    $9.7 million, which is included in gain on disposition of
    assets, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
    Company has not recorded any estimated business interruption
    recoveries due to certain pending issues which the Company
    expects to have resolved in the near future. The Company
    believes that its debris removal and make well safe coverages,
    in combination, will substantially cover the losses to be
    incurred with the abandonment of the East Cameron facility. The
    Company has not recorded any estimated recoveries related to
    insurance due to the early nature of the claim and the need to
    better quantify the claim.

NOTE V.  Discontinued
    Operations

During May 2005, the Company sold its interests in the Martin
    Creek, Conroy Black and Lookout Butte assets in Canada for net
    proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in a gain of
    $138.3 million and, during August 2005, sold certain assets
    on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net proceeds of
    $59.1 million, resulting in a gain of $27.7 million.
    Pursuant to SFAS 144, the gains and the results of
    operations from these assets have been reclassified to
    discontinued operations. The following table represents the

    proceeds of approximately $675 million, subject to normal
    closing adjustments and the retention, subject to limitation, of
    certain obligations. The sale is expected to close during the
    latter part of the first quarter or in early April 2006. The
    Company expects that upon closing of the sale, the results of
    operations from these assets will be reflected as discontinued
    operations in its future financial statements.

    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION — (Continued)

Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003

Reserve
    Quantity Information

The estimates of the Company’s proved oil and gas reserves
    as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, which are located
    in the United States, Argentina, Canada, South Africa and
    Tunisia, were based on evaluations prepared by the
    Company’s engineers and audited by independent petroleum
    engineers with respect to the Company’s major properties
    and prepared by the Company’s engineers with respect to all
    other properties. Reserves were estimated in accordance with
    guidelines established by the United States Securities and
    Exchange Commission and the FASB, which require that reserve
    estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating
    conditions with no provision for price and cost escalations
    except by contractual arrangements. The Company reports all
    reserves held under production sharing arrangements and
    concessions utilizing the “economic interest” method,
    which excludes the host country’s share of proved reserves.
    Estimated quantities for production sharing arrangements
    reported under the “economic interest” method are
    subject to fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas and
    recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. If costs
    remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of
    costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. The
    reserve estimates as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
    utilized respective oil prices of $59.62, $41.96 and
    $31.10 per Bbl (reflecting adjustments for oil quality),
    respective NGL prices of $36.34, $29.12 and $20.26 per Bbl,
    and respective gas prices of $6.36, $4.76 and $4.23 per Mcf
    (reflecting adjustments for Btu content, gas processing and
    shrinkage).

Oil and gas reserve quantity estimates are subject to numerous
    uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved
    reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and
    the timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of such
    estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of
    engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results
    of subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either
    upward or downward revision of previous estimates. Further, the
    volumes considered to be commercially recoverable fluctuate with
    changes in prices and operating costs. The Company emphasizes
    that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that
    estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of
    currently producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these
    estimates are expected to change as additional information
    becomes available in the future.

Proved reserves at December 31, 2005 include 9.2 MMBOE
    related to the ten-year extension periods contained in the
    Company’s Argentine concession agreements. Upon approval by
    the government, the extension periods begin in  2016 and 2017
    depending on the effective date that each concession agreement
    was granted. The Company believes, based on historical
    precedent, that such extensions will be obtained as a matter of
    course. The Argentine proved reserves also assume that the oil
    export tax expires as prescribed by law in February 2007 and
    that Argentine oil prices have parity with worldwide oil prices.

The following table provides a rollforward of total proved
    reserves by geographic area and in total for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, as well as proved
    developed reserves by geographic area and in total as of the
    beginning and end of each respective year. Oil and NGL volumes
    are expressed in thousands of Bbls (“MBbls”), gas
    volumes are expressed in MMcf and total volumes are expressed in
    thousands of Bbls oil equivalent (“MBOE”).

Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is
    computed by applying year-end prices of oil and gas (with
    consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by
    contractual arrangements) to the estimated future production of
    proved oil and gas reserves less estimated future expenditures
    (based on year-end costs) to be incurred in developing and
    producing the proved reserves, discounted using a rate of ten
    percent per year to reflect the estimated timing of the future
    cash flows. Future income taxes are calculated by comparing
    undiscounted future cash flows to the tax basis of oil and gas
    properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying
    the current tax rates to the difference. The discounted future
    cash flow estimates do not include the effects of the
    Company’s commodity hedging contracts. Utilizing
    December 31, 2005 commodity prices held constant over each
    hedge contract’s term, the net present value of the
    Company’s hedge contracts, less associated estimated income
    taxes and discounted at ten percent, was a liability of
    approximately $436 million at December 31, 2005.

Discounted future cash flow estimates like those shown below are
    not intended to represent estimates of the fair value of oil and
    gas properties. Estimates of fair value should also consider
    probable reserves, anticipated future oil and gas prices,
    interest rates, changes in development and production costs and
    risks associated with future production. Because of these and
    other considerations, any estimate of fair value is necessarily
    subjective and imprecise.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
    procedures.

The Company’s management,
    with the participation of its principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, have evaluated, as required by

Rule 13a-15(b)

under the Exchange Act, the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(e))

as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on
    that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer concluded that the design and operation of the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
    in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
    forms.

Changes in internal control over financial
    reporting.

There have been no changes in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company’s
    last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    Company’s financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

As of December 31, 2005, management assessed the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal
    control over financial reporting established in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework”, issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on the assessment, management determined that
    the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial
    statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. The report,
    which expresses unqualified opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005, is included in this Item under the
    heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The Board of
    Directors and Stockholders of

Pioneer Natural Resources Company:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Pioneer Natural Resources Company and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the “COSO criteria”). The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
    assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
    based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and
    2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, cash flows and comprehensive income
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2005 of the Company and our report dated
    February 15, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
