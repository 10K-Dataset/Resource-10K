Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking
            Statements

Parts I and II of this annual report on Form 10-K (the "Report")
            contain

forward-looking statements that involve risks and
            uncertainties. When used in this

document, the words
            "believes," "plans," "expects," "anticipates," "intends,"

"continue," "may," "will," "could," "should," "future," "potential,"
            "estimate," or

the negative of such terms and similar
            expressions as they relate to Pioneer Natural

Resources
            Company ("Pioneer" or the "Company") or its management are intended to

identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements
            are based on the Company's

current expectations,
            assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company and

the industry in which the Company operates. Although the Company
            believes that the expectations

and assumptions reflected
            in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, they

involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, in
            many cases,

beyond the Company's control. Accordingly, no
            assurances can be given that the actual

events and results
            will not be materially different than the anticipated results

described in the forward-looking statements. See "Item 1.

Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations", "Item 1A.
            Risk Factors"

and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
            Disclosures About Market Risk" for a

description of
            various factors that could materially affect the ability of Pioneer to

achieve the anticipated results described in the forward-looking
            statements. The

Company undertakes no duty to publicly
            update these statements except as required by

law.

                            certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under
                            existing economic and operating conditions,

            the reservoir.

(ii)          Reserves
            which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques
            (such as fluid injection) are included in the "proved" classification when successful
            testing by a pilot project, or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir,
            provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was
            based.

(iii)         Estimates of
            proved reserves do not include the following: (A) oil that may become available from
            known reservoirs but is classified separately as "indicated additional reserves"; (B)
            crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, the recovery of which is subject to
            reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology, reservoir characteristics or
            economic factors; (C) crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, that may occur in
            undrilled prospects; and (D) crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that may be
            recovered from oil shales, coal, gilsonite and other such sources.

http://www.sec.gov

.

The Company also makes available free of charge through its internet
            website (

www.pxd.com

) its Annual
            Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and,
            if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a)
            of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files
            such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

Mission and Strategies

The Company's mission is to enhance shareholder investment returns
            through strategies that maximize Pioneer's long-term profitability and net asset value.
            The strategies employed to achieve this mission are predicated on maintaining financial
            flexibility and capital allocation discipline. These strategies are anchored by the
            Company's long-lived Spraberry oil field and Hugoton, Raton and West Panhandle gas
            fields which have an estimated remaining productive life in excess of 40 years.
            Underlying these fields are approximately 89 percent of the Company's proved oil and
            gas reserves as of December 31, 2007.

Business Activities

The Company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production
            company. Pioneer's purpose is to competitively and profitably explore for, develop and
            produce oil and gas reserves. In so doing, the Company sells homogenous oil, NGL and
            gas units which, except for geographic and relatively minor quality differences, cannot
            be significantly differentiated from units offered for sale by the Company's
            competitors. Competitive advantage is gained in the oil and gas exploration and
            development industry by employing well-trained experienced personnel who make prudent
            capital investment decisions, embrace technological innovation and are focused on price
            and cost management.

Petroleum industry.

For the last
            several years the petroleum industry has generally been characterized by volatile oil,
            NGL and gas commodity prices. During recent years, world oil prices increased in
            response to increases in demand from developing economies and the perceived threat of
            supply disruptions in the Middle East, Nigeria, Venezuela and other areas. In 2007, oil
            prices increased due to supply uncertainty surrounding Middle East conflicts and
            increasing world demand for both oil and refined products. A significant increase of
            refinery outages led to tightness in products markets which was responsible for oil
            price strength throughout much of the year. North American gas prices were generally
            consistent throughout 2007. Early 2007 price weakness, a result of a significant
            inventory overhang and mild weather, was largely offset by early fall when LNG imports
            to the Gulf Coast were reduced. LNG cargoes slated for delivery into the U.S. instead
            were sold into Asia and Europe in response to major demand increases brought on by
            harsh weather and large nuclear powered electric generation plant outages. Significant
            factors that will impact 2008 commodity prices include: developments in the issues
            currently impacting


Iraq
            and Iran and the Middle East in general; demand of Asian and European markets; the
            extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC")
            and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil supply through
            export quotas; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals, including
            the impact of uncertain LNG deliveries to the United States. Perhaps the issue having
            the greatest impact on prices will be the strength of the U.S. economy and the prospect
            of a recession. In conjunction with the relatively higher commodity prices experienced
            during 2007, the Company also experienced increasing costs, particularly higher
            drilling and well servicing rig rates and drilling supplies.

To mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on the Company's
            net asset value, Pioneer utilizes commodity hedge contracts. See "Item 7A. Quantitative
            and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note J of Notes to Consolidated
            Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"
            for information regarding the impact to oil and gas revenues during 2007, 2006 and 2005
            from the Company's hedging activities and the Company's open hedge positions at
            December 31, 2007.

The Company.

The Company's asset
            base is anchored by the Spraberry oil field located in West Texas, the Raton gas field
            located in southern Colorado, the Hugoton gas field located in southwest Kansas and the
            West Panhandle gas field located in the Texas Panhandle. Complementing these areas, the
            Company has exploration and development opportunities and/or oil and gas production
            activities in the Edwards Trend area of South Texas, the Barnett Shale area of North
            Texas, the Gulf of Mexico shelf, Mississippi and Alaska, and internationally in South
            Africa and Tunisia. Combined, these assets create a portfolio of resources and
            opportunities that are well balanced among oil, NGLs and gas, and that are also well
            balanced among long-lived, dependable production, lower-risk exploration and
            development opportunities and a limited number of higher-impact exploration
            opportunities. Additionally, the Company has a team of dedicated employees that
            represent the professional disciplines and sciences that will allow Pioneer to maximize
            the long-term profitability and net asset value inherent in its physical
            assets.

The Company provides administrative, financial, legal and management
            support to United States and foreign subsidiaries that explore for, develop and produce
            proved reserves. Production operations are principally located domestically in Texas,
            Kansas, Colorado, Alaska, Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico shelf, and internationally
            in South Africa and Tunisia.

Production.

The Company focuses its
            efforts towards maximizing its average daily production of oil, NGLs and gas through
            development drilling, production enhancement activities and acquisitions of producing
            properties while minimizing the controllable costs associated with the production
            activities. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company's average daily
            production, on a BOE basis, increased eight percent as a result of successful drilling
            programs in the United States and Tunisia and a five percent decrease in the delivery
            of VPP volumes. Production, price and cost information with respect to the Company's
            properties for 2007, 2006 and 2005 is set forth under "Item 2. Properties —
            Selected Oil and Gas Information — Production, Price and Cost Data".

Development activities.

The Company
            seeks to increase its oil and gas reserves, production and cash flow through
            development drilling and by conducting other production enhancement activities, such as
            well recompletions. During the three years ended December 31, 2007, the Company drilled
            2,608 gross (2,415 net) wells, 96 percent of which were successfully completed as
            productive wells, at a total drilling cost (net to the Company's interest) of $4.2
            billion.

The Company believes that its current property base provides a
            substantial inventory of prospects for future reserve, production and cash flow growth.
            The Company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2007 include proved undeveloped
            reserves and proved developed reserves that are behind pipe of 221 MMBbls of oil and
            NGLs and 1,003 Bcf of gas. Development of these proved reserves will require future
            capital expenditures. The timing of the development of these reserves will be dependent
            upon the commodity price environment, the Company's expected operating cash flows and
            the Company's financial condition. The Company believes that its current portfolio of
            proved reserves and unproved prospects provides attractive development and exploration
            opportunities for at least the next three to five years.

Exploratory activities.

The Company
            has devoted significant efforts and resources to hiring and developing a highly skilled
            geoscience staff as well as acquiring a portfolio of lower-risk exploration
            opportunities complemented by a limited number of higher-impact exploration
            opportunities. In 2008, the Company expects to spend approximately 90 percent of its
            $1.0 billion capital budget on low-risk development and resource play extension
            drilling in its four core onshore areas (Spraberry, Raton, Edwards Trend and Tunisia).
            The remaining ten percent will be focused primarily on development drilling in the
            Company's Alaskan Oooguruk project and Barnett Shale drilling. Exploratory and
            extension drilling involve greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial
            quantities


of
            hydrocarbons than development drilling or enhanced recovery activities. See "Item 1A.
            Risk Factors — Drilling activities" below.

Acquisition activities.

The Company
            regularly seeks to acquire properties that complement its operations, provide
            exploration and development opportunities and potentially provide superior returns on
            investment. In addition, the Company pursues strategic acquisitions that will allow the
            Company to expand into new geographical areas that feature producing properties and
            provide exploration/exploitation opportunities. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
            invested $536.7 million, $223.2 million and $272.9 million, respectively, of
            acquisition capital to purchase proved oil and gas properties, including additional
            interests in its existing assets, and to acquire new prospects for future exploitation
            and exploration activities. See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
            included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of
            the Company's acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties during 2007, 2006 and
            2005.

The Company periodically evaluates and pursues acquisition opportunities
            (including opportunities to acquire particular oil and gas assets or entities owning
            oil and gas assets and opportunities to engage in mergers, consolidations or other
            business combinations with such entities) and at any given time may be in various
            stages of evaluating such opportunities. Such stages may take the form of internal
            financial analysis, oil and gas reserve analysis, due diligence, the submission of an
            indication of interest, preliminary negotiations, negotiation of a letter of intent or
            negotiation of a definitive agreement. The success of any acquisition is uncertain and
            will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside the Company's control.
            See "Item 1A. Risk Factors — Acquisitions".

Asset divestitures.

The Company
            regularly reviews its asset base for the purpose of identifying nonstrategic assets,
            the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other
            activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies. While the Company
            generally does not dispose of assets solely for the purpose of reducing debt, such
            dispositions can have the result of furthering the Company's objective of increasing
            financial flexibility through reduced debt levels. See Notes N, T and V of Notes to
            Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
            Supplementary Data" for specific information regarding the Company's asset
            divestitures, VPPs and discontinued operations during 2007, 2006 and 2005.

The Company anticipates that it will continue to sell nonstrategic
            properties or other assets from time to time to increase capital resources available
            for other activities, to achieve operating and administrative efficiencies and to
            improve profitability.

Operations by Geographic Area

The Company operates in one industry segment, that being oil and gas
            exploration and production. See Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
            included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for geographic
            operating segment information, including results of operations and segment
            assets.

Marketing of Production

General.

Production from the
            Company's properties is marketed using methods that are consistent with industry
            practices. Sales prices for oil, NGL and gas production are negotiated based on factors
            normally considered in the industry, such as the index or spot price for gas or the
            spot price for oil, price regulations, distance from the well to the pipeline, well
            pressure, estimated reserves, commodity quality and prevailing supply conditions. See
            "Qualitative Disclosures" in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
            Market Risk" for additional discussion of operations and price risk.

Significant purchasers.

During 2007,
            the Company's significant purchasers of oil, NGLs and gas were Plains Marketing LP (14
            percent), Oneok Resources (11 percent) and Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. (11
            percent). The Company is of the opinion that the loss of any one purchaser would not
            have an adverse effect on its ability to sell its oil, NGL and gas
            production.

Hedging activities.

The Company,
            from time to time, utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to (i) reduce
            the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii)
            support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce
            commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. See "Item 7.
            Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
            for a description of the Company's hedging activities, "Item 7A. Quantitative and
            Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note J of Notes to Consolidated
            Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"
            for information concerning the impact on oil and gas revenues


during 2007, 2006 and 2005 from commodity hedging activities and the
            Company's open and terminated commodity hedge positions at December 31,
            2007.

Competition, Markets and Regulations

Competition.

The oil and gas
            industry is highly competitive. A large number of companies, including major integrated
            and other independent companies, and individuals engage in the exploration for and
            development of oil and gas properties, and there is a high degree of competition for
            oil and gas properties suitable for development or exploration. Acquisitions of oil and
            gas properties have been an important element of the Company's growth. The Company
            intends to continue to acquire oil and gas properties that complement its operations,
            provide exploration and development opportunities and potentially provide superior
            returns on investment. The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of oil and
            gas properties include the staff and data necessary to identify, evaluate and acquire
            such properties and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop the
            properties. Higher recent commodity prices have increased the cost of oil and gas
            properties available for acquisition. Many of the Company's competitors are
            substantially larger and have financial and other resources greater than those of the
            Company.

Markets.

The Company's ability to
            produce and market oil, NGLs and gas profitably depends on numerous factors beyond the
            Company's control. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted or
            anticipated. Although the Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that may
            affect these commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the
            prices for any commodity that the Company produces will generally approximate current
            market prices in the geographic region of the production.

Governmental regulations.

Enterprises that sell securities in public markets are subject to
            regulatory oversight by agencies such as the SEC and the NYSE. This regulatory
            oversight imposes on the Company the responsibility for establishing and maintaining
            disclosure controls and procedures that will ensure that material information relating
            to the Company is made known to management and that the financial statements and other
            information included in submissions to the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a
            material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made in
            such submissions not misleading. Compliance with some of these regulations is costly
            and regulations are subject to change or reinterpretation.

Environmental matters and regulations.

The Company's operations are subject to stringent and complex foreign,
            federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as
            well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations
            may, among other things:

•

require the acquisition of various permits before
                            drilling commences;

•

enjoin some or all of the operations of facilities
                            deemed in non-compliance with permits;

•

restrict the types, quantities and concentration of
                            various substances that can be released into the environment in
                            connection with oil and gas drilling, production and transportation
                            activities;

•

limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands
                            lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;
                            and

•

require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from
                            former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and
                            plug abandoned wells.

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and
            gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden
            on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and
            consequently affects profitability. Additionally, United States Congress and state
            legislatures, federal and state agencies and foreign government and agencies frequently
            revise environmental laws and regulations, and the clear trend in environmental
            regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect
            the environment. Any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling,
            disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and gas industry could have a significant
            impact on the Company's operating costs.

The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and
            regulations to which the Company's business operations are subject.

Waste handling.

The Resource Conservation
            and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes regulate the generation,
            transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous
            wastes. Under the auspices of the federal Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the
            individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in
            conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced
            waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and
            production of crude oil or gas are currently regulated under RCRA's non-hazardous
            waste


provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration
            and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous
            wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in the Company's
            costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on
            the Company's results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of the
            Company's operations, it generates some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as
            paint wastes, waste solvents, and waste oils, that may be regulated as hazardous
            wastes.

Wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials ("NORM") may
            also be generated in connection with the Company's operations. Certain processes used
            to produce oil and gas may enhance the radioactivity of NORM, which may be present in
            oilfield wastes. NORM is not subject to regulation under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
            or the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. NORM is subject primarily to individual
            state radiation control regulations. In addition, NORM handling and management
            activities are governed by regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and
            Health Administration ("OSHA"). These state and OSHA regulations impose certain
            requirements concerning worker protection; the treatment, storage and disposal of NORM
            waste; the management of waste piles, containers and tanks containing NORM; as well as
            restrictions on the uses of land with NORM contamination.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
            Act.

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
            and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and
            several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of
            persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance
            into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of
            the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the
            disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may
            be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous
            substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural
            resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon
            for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury
            and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the
            environment.

The Company currently owns or leases numerous properties that have been
            used for oil and gas exploration and production for many years. Although the Company
            believes it has utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in
            the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been
            released on or under the properties owned or leased by the Company, or on or under
            other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken
            for disposal. In addition, some of the Company's properties have been operated by third
            parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous
            substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons were not under the Company's control. In fact,
            there is evidence that petroleum spills or releases have occurred in the past at some
            of the properties owned or leased by the Company. These properties and the substances
            disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws.
            Under such laws, the Company could be required to remove previously disposed substances
            and wastes, remediate contaminated property or perform remedial plugging or pit closure
            operations to prevent future contamination.

Water discharges and use.

The Clean Water
            Act (the "CWA") and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with
            respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other
            substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into
            regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued
            by EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder
            also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters,
            including wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill
            prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate
            containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable
            waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. Federal and
            state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for
            non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous
            state laws and regulations.

The primary federal law imposing liability for oil spills is the Oil
            Pollution Act ("OPA"), which sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and
            cleanup of oil spills. OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore
            facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of
            the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties, including owners and operators of
            onshore facilities, may be subject to oil spill cleanup costs and natural resource
            damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil
            spills.

Operations associated with the Company's properties also produce
            wastewaters that are disposed via injection in underground wells. These activities are
            regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act (the "SDWA") and


analogous state and local laws. The underground injection well program
            under the SDWA classifies produced wastewaters and imposes restrictions on the drilling
            and operation of disposal wells as well as the quality of injected wastewaters. This
            program is designed to protect drinking water sources and requires permits from the EPA
            or analogous state agency for the Company's disposal wells. Currently, the Company
            believes that disposal well operations on the Company's properties comply with all
            applicable requirements under the SDWA. However, a change in the regulations or the
            inability to obtain permits for new injection wells in the future may affect the
            Company's ability to dispose of produced waters and ultimately increase the cost of the
            Company's operations.

The waters produced by the Company's CBM operations also may be subject
            to the laws of various states and regulatory bodies regarding the ownership and use of
            water. For example, in connection with the Company's CBM operations in the Raton Basin
            in Colorado, water is removed from coal seams to reduce pressure and allow the methane
            to be recovered. Historically, these operations have been regulated by the state agency
            responsible for regulating oil and gas activity in the state. In a recent case brought
            by the owners of ranch land involving a CBM competitor in a different CBM basin in
            Colorado, a state water court held that the use of water in CBM operations should be
            subject to water-use regulation under an additional agency as is the case with other
            uses of water in the state, including the need for the obtaining of permits, possible
            competition with other claimants for the use of the water and the possibility of
            providing mitigation water for other water users. That decision is on appeal. However,
            if that ruling or a similar ruling or regulation becomes applicable to the Company's
            CBM or other oil and gas operations, the Company's ability to expand its operations
            could be adversely affected and these changes in regulation could ultimately increase
            the Company's cost of doing business.

Air emissions.

The Federal Clean Air Act
            (the "CAA") and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants
            through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements.
            Such laws and regulations may require a facility to obtain pre-approval for the
            construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air
            emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions; obtain or strictly
            comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations; or
            utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions of certain air
            pollutants. In addition, EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent
            regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Moreover,
            states can impose air emissions limitations that are more stringent than the federal
            standards imposed by EPA. Federal and state regulatory agencies can also impose
            administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or
            other requirements of the federal CAA and associated state laws and
            regulations.

Permits and related compliance obligations under the CAA, as well as
            changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional
            non-attainment areas, may require the Company to incur future capital expenditures in
            connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment
            and strategies for gas and oil exploration and production operations. In addition, some
            gas and oil production facilities may be included within the categories of hazardous
            air pollutant sources, which are subject to increasing regulation under the CAA.
            Failure to comply with these requirements could subject a regulated entity to monetary
            penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and enforcement
            actions. Gas and oil exploration and production facilities may be required to incur
            certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in
            connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air
            emissions.

Health and safety.

The Company's operations
            are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (the
            "OSH Act") and comparable state statutes. These laws and the implementing regulations
            strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSH Act
            hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III
            of CERCLA and similar state statues require that the Company organize and/or disclose
            information about hazardous materials used or produced in the Company's operations. The
            Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with these applicable
            requirements and with other OSH Act and comparable requirements.

Global warming and climate change.

Recent
            scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to
            as "greenhouse gases" and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to
            warming of the Earth's atmosphere. In response to such studies, the U.S. Congress is
            actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition,
            several states (not including Texas) have already taken legal measures to reduce
            emissions of greenhouse gases. Also, as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision
            on April 2, 2007 in

Massachusetts, et al. v.
            EPA

, the EPA may be required to regulate greenhouse gas
            emissions from mobile sources (

e.g.

,
            cars and trucks) even if Congress does not adopt new legislation specifically
            addressing emissions of greenhouse gases. Other nations have already agreed to regulate
            emissions of greenhouse gases, pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on
            Climate Change, also known as the "Kyoto Protocol," an international treaty pursuant to
            which participating countries (not including the United States) have agreed to reduce
            their emissions of greenhouse gases to below 1990 levels by 2012. Passage of climate
            control legislation or other


regulatory initiatives by Congress or various states of the U.S. or the
            adoption of regulations by the EPA and analogous state agencies that restrict emissions
            of greenhouse gases in areas in which the Company conducts business could have an
            adverse effect on the Company's operations and demand for oil and gas.

The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with all existing
            environmental laws and regulations applicable to the Company's current operations and
            that its continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material
            adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. For
            instance, the Company did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation
            or pollution control activities for the year ended December 31, 2007. Additionally, the
            Company is not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material
            capital expenditures during 2008. However, accidental spills or releases may occur in
            the course of the Company's operations, and the Company cannot give any assurance that
            it will not incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or
            releases, including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons.
            Moreover, the Company cannot give any assurance that the passage of more stringent laws
            or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on the Company's business,
            financial condition and results of operations.

Other regulation of the oil and gas
            industry.

The oil and gas industry is regulated by
            numerous foreign, federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil
            and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently
            increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, foreign,
            federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on
            the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial
            penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and gas
            industry may increase the Company's cost of doing business by increasing the cost of
            transporting its production to market, these burdens generally do not affect the
            Company any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other
            companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of
            production.

The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007 requires
            the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") to issue regulations establishing
            risk-based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial
            facilities, including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present "high levels of
            security risk." The DHS is currently in the process of adopting regulations that will
            determine whether some of the Company's facilities or operations will be subject to
            additional DHS-mandated security requirements. Presently, it is not possible to
            accurately estimate the costs the Company could incur, directly or indirectly, to
            comply with any such facility security laws or regulations, but such expenditures could
            be substantial.

Development and production.

Development and
            production operations are subject to various types of regulation at foreign, federal,
            state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the
            drilling of wells, the posting of bonds in connection with various types of activities
            and filing reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and
            municipalities, in which the Company operates also regulate one or more of the
            following:

•

the location of wells;

•

the method of drilling and casing wells;

•

the surface use and restoration of properties upon which
                            wells are drilled;

•

the plugging and abandoning of wells; and

•

notice to surface owners and other third
                            parties.

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or
            proration units governing the pooling of oil and gas properties. Some states allow
            forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states
            rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or
            unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce the Company's interest
            in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum
            rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring
            of gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and
            regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas the Company can produce from the
            Company's wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which the Company can
            drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with
            respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and gas within its jurisdiction. States
            do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but there
            can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future
            regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and gas that may be produced from the
            Company's wells, negatively impact the economics of production from these wells and/or
            to limit the number of locations the Company can drill.

Regulation of transportation and sale of gas.

The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect
            sales of gas. Foreign, federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for
            access to gas pipeline transportation. The interstate transportation and sale for
            resale of gas is subject to federal regulation, including


regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate
            transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy
            Regulatory Commission ("FERC"). The FERC's regulations for interstate gas transmission
            in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas.

Although gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has
            been active in the area of gas regulation. The Company cannot predict whether new
            legislation to regulate gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually
            be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the
            proposals might have on the Company's operations. Sales of condensate and gas liquids
            are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.

Gas gathering.

While the Company owns or
            operates some gas gathering facilities, the Company also depends on gathering
            facilities owned and operated by third parties to gather production from its
            properties, and therefore the Company is impacted by the rates charged by such third
            parties for gathering services. To the extent that changes in foreign, federal and/or
            state regulation affect the rates charged for gathering services, the Company also may
            be affected by such changes. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate that the
            Company would be affected any differently than similarly situated gas
            producers.

ITEM
            1A. RISK FACTORS

The nature of the business activities conducted by the Company subjects
            it to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material
            risks relating to the Company's business activities. Other risks are described in "Item
            1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations" and "Item 7A. Quantitative
            and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk". These risks are not the only risks
            facing the Company. The Company's business could also be impacted by additional risks
            and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be
            immaterial. If any of these risks actually occur, they could materially harm the
            Company's business, financial condition or results of operations and impair Pioneer's
            ability to implement business plans or complete development projects as scheduled. In
            that case, the market price of the Company's common stock could decline.

The prices of oil, NGL and gas are at historically high levels and
            are highly volatile. A sustained decline in these commodity prices could adversely
            affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

The Company's revenues, profitability, cash flow and future rate of
            growth are highly dependent on commodity prices. Oil prices have recently been at
            historically high levels and gas prices have been at high levels over the past several
            years when compared to prior periods. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response
            to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market
            uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such
            as:

•

domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, NGL
                            and gas;

•

weather conditions;

•

overall domestic and global political and economic
                            conditions, including those in the Middle East, Africa and South
                            America;

•

actions of OPEC and other state-controlled oil companies
                            relating to oil price and production controls;

•

the impact of increasing LNG deliveries to the United
                            States;

•

technological advances affecting energy consumption and
                            energy supply;

•

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and
                            taxation;

•

the impact of energy conservation efforts;

•

the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of
                            pipelines and other transportation facilities; and

•

the price and availability of alternative
                            fuels.

In
            the past, commodity prices have been extremely volatile, and the Company expects this
            volatility to continue. A significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a
            material adverse effect on the Company's revenues, profitability and cash flow. The
            Company makes price assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a significant
            portion of the Company's cash outlays, including rent, salaries and noncancellable
            capital commitments, are largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are
            below expectations, the Company's financial results are likely to be adversely and
            disproportionately affected because these cash outlays are not variable in the short
            term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in commodity
            prices.


The Company's hedging activities could result in financial
            losses.

To reduce exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, the Company has
            entered into, and expects in the future to enter into, hedging arrangements for a
            portion of its oil and gas production. These hedging arrangements may expose the
            Company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when:

•

production is less than the hedged volumes;

•

the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on
                            their contract obligations; or

•

the hedging arrangements limit the benefit the Company
                            would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices.

Exploration and development drilling may not result in
            commercially productive reserves.

Drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that no
            commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of
            drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and drilling operations may
            be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors,
            including:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

adverse weather conditions;

•

restricted access to land for drilling or laying
                            pipelines; and

•

costs of, or shortages or delays in the delivery of,
                            drilling rigs and equipment.

The Company's future drilling activities may not be successful and, if
            unsuccessful, such failure could have an adverse effect on the Company's future results
            of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental,
            extension or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory and extension drilling
            involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of
            hydrocarbons. The Company expects that it will continue to experience exploration and
            abandonment expense in 2008. Increased levels of drilling activity in the oil and gas
            industry in recent periods have led to increased costs of some drilling equipment,
            materials and supplies. If these trends continue in the future, they may impact the
            Company's profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development projects as
            scheduled.

Future price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying
            value of the Company's proved oil and gas properties, which could adversely affect the
            Company's results of operations.

Declines in commodity prices may result in the Company having to make
            substantial downward adjustments to the Company's estimated proved reserves. If this
            occurs, or if the Company's estimates of production or economic factors change,
            accounting rules may require the Company to write-down, as a noncash charge to
            earnings, the carrying value of the Company's oil and gas properties for impairments.
            The Company is required to perform impairment tests on proved assets whenever events or
            changes in circumstances warrant a review of the Company's proved oil and gas
            properties. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life
            or estimated future cash flows of the Company's oil and gas properties, the carrying
            value may not be recoverable and therefore require a write-down. The Company may incur
            impairment charges in the future, which could materially affect the Company's results
            of operations in the period incurred.

The Company periodically evaluates its unproved oil and gas
            properties, and could be required to recognize noncash charges in the earnings of
            future periods.

At December 31, 2007, the Company carried unproved property costs of
            $277.5 million. GAAP requires periodic evaluation of these costs on a
            project-by-project basis in comparison to their estimated fair value. These evaluations
            will be affected by the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks,
            planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of the leases, contracts and
            permits appurtenant to such projects. If the quantity of potential reserves determined
            by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each
            project, the Company will recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future
            periods.


The Company may be unable to make attractive acquisitions, and any
            acquisition it completes is subject to substantial risks that could impact its
            business.

Acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have been an important
            element of the Company's growth. The Company's growth following the full development of
            its existing property base could be impeded if it is unable to acquire additional oil
            and gas reserves on a profitable basis. Acquisition opportunities in the oil and gas
            industry are very competitive, which can increase the cost of, or cause the Company to
            refrain from, completing acquisitions. In addition, higher recent commodity prices have
            increased the cost of properties available for acquisition. The success of any
            acquisition will depend on a number of factors and involve potential risks, including
            among other things:

•

the ability to estimate accurately the costs to develop
                            the reserves, the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future
                            production and future net cash flows attainable from the
                            reserves;

•

the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs
                            for which the Company is not indemnified or for which the indemnity the
                            Company receives is inadequate;

•

the validity of assumptions about costs, including
                            synergies;

•

the impact on the Company's liquidity or financial
                            leverage of using available cash or debt to finance
                            acquisitions;

•

the diversion of management's attention from other
                            business concerns; and

•

an inability to hire, train or retain qualified
                            personnel to manage and operate the Company's growing business and
                            assets.

All
            of these factors affect whether an acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows
            sufficient to provide a suitable return on investment. Even though the Company performs
            a review of the properties it seeks to acquire that it believes is consistent with
            industry practices, such reviews are often limited in scope. As a result, among other
            risks, the Company's initial estimates of reserves may be subject to revision following
            an acquisition, which may materially and adversely impact the desired benefits of the
            acquisition.

The Company may be unable to dispose of nonstrategic assets on
            attractive terms, and may be required to retain liabilities for certain
            matters.

The Company regularly reviews its property base for the purpose of
            identifying nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase capital
            resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational
            efficiencies. Various factors could materially affect the ability of the Company to
            dispose of nonstrategic assets, including the availability of purchasers willing to
            purchase the nonstrategic assets at prices acceptable to the Company. Sellers typically
            retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters. The magnitude of
            any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify
            at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in
            divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release the Company from
            guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets.
            As a result, after a sale the Company may remain secondarily liable for the obligations
            guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform
            these obligations.

The Company periodically evaluates its goodwill for impairment,
            and could be required to recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future
            periods.

At December 31, 2007, the Company carried goodwill of $310.9 million
            associated with its United States reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at
            least annually, requiring an estimate of the fair values of the Company's assets and
            liabilities. If the fair value of the Company's net assets is not sufficient to fully
            support the goodwill balance, the Company will reduce the carrying value of goodwill
            for the impaired value, with a corresponding noncash charge to earnings in the period
            in which goodwill is determined to be impaired.

The Company's gas processing operations are subject to operational
            risks, which could result in significant damages and the loss of
            revenue.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company owned interests in four gas
            processing plants and ten treating facilities. The Company operates two of the gas
            processing plants and all ten treating facilities. There are significant risks
            associated with the operation of gas processing plants. Gas and NGLs are volatile and
            explosive and may include carcinogens. Damage to or misoperation of a gas processing
            plant or facility could result in an explosion or the discharge of toxic gases, which
            could result in significant damage claims in addition to interrupting a revenue
            source.


The Company's operations involve many operational risks, some of
            which could result in substantial losses to the Company and unforeseen interruptions to
            the Company's operations for which the Company may not be adequately
            insured.

The Company's operations are subject to all the risks normally incident
            to the oil and gas exploration and production business, including:

•

blowouts, cratering, explosions and fires;

•

adverse weather effects;

•

environmental hazards, such as gas leaks, oil spills,
                            pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases;

•

high costs, shortages or delivery delays of equipment,
                            labor or other services;

•

facility or equipment malfunctions, failures or
                            accidents;

•

title problems;

•

pipe or cement failures or casing collapses;

•

compliance with environmental and other governmental
                            requirements;

•

lost or damaged oilfield workover and service
                            tools;

•

unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressure
                            or irregularities in formations; and

•

natural disasters.

Any of these risks could result in substantial losses to the Company due
            to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or
            other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and
            suspension of operations.

Although the Company currently maintains insurance coverage that it
            considers reasonable and that is similar to that maintained by comparable companies in
            the oil and gas industry, it is not fully insured against certain of the risks
            described above, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high
            premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining such insurance. Additionally,
            the Company relies to a large extent on facilities owned and operated by third-parties,
            and damage to or destruction of those third-party facilities could affect the ability
            of the Company to produce, transport and sell its hydrocarbons.

The Company may not be able to obtain access to pipelines, gas
            gathering, transmission and processing facilities to market its oil and gas
            production.

The marketing of oil and gas production depends in large part on the
            availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, gas gathering systems and other
            transportation, processing and refining facilities, as well as the existence of
            adequate markets. If there were insufficient capacity available on these systems, or if
            these systems were unavailable to the Company, the price offered for the Company's
            production could be significantly depressed, or the Company could be forced to shut-in
            some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production
            following a discovery of hydrocarbons while it constructs its own facility. The Company
            also relies (and expects to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by
            third parties in order to process, transmit and sell its oil and gas production. The
            Company's plans to develop and sell its oil and gas reserves could be materially and
            adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide
            sufficient transmission or processing facilities to the Company.

The nature of the Company's assets exposes it to significant costs
            and liabilities with respect to environmental and operational safety
            matters.

The oil and gas business is subject to environmental hazards, such as
            oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances
            or gases that could expose the Company to substantial liability due to pollution and
            other environmental damage. A variety of United States federal, state and local, as
            well as foreign laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of the oil and
            gas business. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject the Company to
            administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial cleanups, and natural resource
            damages or other liabilities, and compliance with these laws and regulations may
            increase the cost of the Company's operations. Such laws and regulations may also
            affect the costs of acquisitions. See "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets
            and Regulations — Environmental matters and regulations" above for additional
            discussion related to environmental risks.

The Company does not believe that its environmental risks are materially
            different from those of comparable companies in the oil and gas industry. Nevertheless,
            no assurance can be given that existing or future environmental


laws
            will not result in a curtailment of production or processing activities, result in a
            material increase in the costs of production, development, exploration or processing
            operations or adversely affect the Company's future operations and financial condition.
            Pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.

The Company's credit facility and debt instruments have
            substantial restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict its business and
            financing activities.

The Company is a borrower under fixed rate senior notes, senior
            convertible notes and a credit facility. The terms of the Company's borrowings under
            the senior notes, senior convertible notes and the credit facility specify scheduled
            debt repayments and require the Company to comply with certain associated covenants and
            restrictions. The Company's ability to comply with the debt repayment terms, associated
            covenants and restrictions is dependent on, among other things, factors outside the
            Company's direct control, such as commodity prices and interest rates. See Note F of
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
            and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the Company's outstanding debt as of
            December 31, 2007 and the terms associated therewith.

The Company's ability to obtain additional financing is also impacted by
            the Company's debt credit ratings and competition for available debt financing. See
            "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
            Operations" for a discussion of the Company's debt credit ratings.

The Company faces significant competition and many of its
            competitors have resources in excess of the Company's available
            resources.

The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. The Company competes
            with a large number of companies, producers and operators in a number of areas such
            as:

•

seeking to acquire oil and gas properties suitable for
                            development or exploration;

•

marketing oil, NGL and gas production; and

•

seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise,
                            including trained personnel, necessary to operate and develop
                            properties.

Many
            of the Company's competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and
            other resources than the Company. See "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets
            and Regulations" above for additional discussion regarding competition.

The Company's business depends to a significant extent upon the
            continued service and performance of key senior managers and technical
            personnel.

The Company's business depends to a significant extent upon the
            continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key senior managers
            and technical personnel. The loss of any existing key personnel, or the inability to
            attract, motivate and retain additional key personnel, could harm the Company's
            business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company is subject to regulations that may cause it to incur
            substantial costs.

The Company's business is regulated by a variety of federal, state,
            local and foreign laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that present or
            future regulations will not adversely affect the Company's business and operations. See
            "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations" above for additional
            discussion regarding government regulation.

The Company's international operations may be adversely affected
            by economic, political and other factors.

At December 31, 2007, approximately three percent of the Company's
            proved reserves were located outside the United States. The success and profitability
            of international operations may be adversely affected by risks associated with
            international activities, including:

•

economic and labor conditions;

•

war, terrorist acts and civil disturbances;

•

political instability;


•

loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of
                            actions taken by foreign countries where the Company has operations,
                            such as expropriation or nationalization of assets and renegotiation,
                            modification or nullification of existing contracts;

•

changes in taxation policies (including host-country
                            import-export, excise and income taxes and United States taxes on
                            foreign subsidiaries);

•

laws and policies of the United States and foreign
                            jurisdictions affecting foreign investment, trade and business conduct;
                            and

•

changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local
                            currencies in which oil and gas producing activities may be
                            denominated.

In
            some cases, the market for the Company's production in foreign countries is limited to
            some extent. For example, all of the Company's gas and condensate production from the
            South Coast Gas project in South Africa is currently committed by contract to a single,
            government-affiliated gas-to-liquids facility. If such facility ceased to purchase the
            gas because of an unforeseen event excusing performance, it might be difficult to find
            an alternative market for the production, and if such a market were secured, the price
            received by the Company might be less than that provided under its current gas sales
            contract. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" included in "Item 7. Management's
            Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", "Qualitative
            Disclosures – Foreign currency, operations and price risk" in "Item 7A.
            Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note B of Notes to
            Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
            Supplementary Data" for information regarding other risks associated with the Company's
            international operations.

Estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not
            precise. The actual quantities and net cash flows of the Company's proved reserves may
            prove to be lower than estimated.

Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves
            and future net cash flows therefrom. The estimates of proved reserves and related
            future net cash flows set forth in this Report are based on various assumptions, which
            may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.

Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground
            accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of
            economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon
            a number of variable factors and assumptions, including the following:

•

historical production from the area compared with
                            production from other producing areas;

•

the quality and quantity of available data;

•

the interpretation of that data;

•

the assumed effects of regulations by governmental
                            agencies;

•

assumptions concerning future commodity prices;
                            and

•

assumptions concerning future operating costs,
                            severance, ad valorem and excise taxes, development costs and workover
                            and remedial costs.

Because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the
            following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating
            reserves:

•

the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately
                            recovered;

•

the production and operating costs incurred;

•

the amount and timing of future development
                            expenditures; and

•

future commodity prices.

Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of
            reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. The Company's actual
            production, revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different
            from estimates and the differences may be material.

As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows
            from proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate,
            while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future
            net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:

•

the amount and timing of actual production;

•

levels of future capital spending;

•

increases or decreases in the supply of or demand for
                            oil and gas; and

•

changes in governmental regulations or
                            taxation.


The Company reports all proved reserves held under production sharing
            arrangements and concessions utilizing the "economic interest" method, which excludes
            the host country's share of proved reserves. Estimated quantities of production sharing
            arrangements reported under the "economic interest" method are subject to fluctuations
            in commodity prices and recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. If costs
            remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change
            inversely to changes in commodity prices.

Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common
            basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the
            SEC. It requires the use of commodity prices, as well as operating and development
            costs, prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, it may not reflect the
            prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and gas production because
            of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions, nor may it reflect
            the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and gas
            properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be
            materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In
            addition, the ten percent discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in
            calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the
            most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time
            and risks associated with the Company or the oil and gas industry in general.
            Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows or Standardized Measure in
            this Report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value
            of the Company's proved reserves.

The Company's actual production could differ materially from its
            forecasts.

From time to time the Company provides forecasts of expected quantities
            of future oil and gas production. These forecasts are based on a number of estimates,
            including expectations of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome
            of future drilling activity. Should these estimates prove inaccurate, actual production
            could be adversely impacted. Downturns in commodity prices could make certain drilling
            activities or production uneconomical, which would also adversely impact
            production.

The Company may be unable to complete its plans to repurchase its
            common stock.

The Board of Directors (the "Board") approves share repurchase programs
            and sets limits on the price per share at which Pioneer's common stock can be
            repurchased. From time to time, the Company may not be permitted to repurchase its
            stock during certain periods because of scheduled and unscheduled trading blackouts.
            Additionally, business conditions and availability of capital may dictate that
            repurchases be suspended or canceled. As a result, there can be no assurance that
            additional repurchase programs will be commenced and, if so, that they will be
            completed.

The Company may be unable to complete its plans to form a master
            limited partnership in the time expected, or at all, and the structure and terms of any
            master limited partnership could change materially from those
            anticipated.

In April, 2007, the Company announced an intention to form two new
            master limited partnerships, which would own interests in long-lived, low-decline oil
            and gas assets. Although the Company's subsidiary, Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners
            L.P. ("Pioneer Southwest"), has filed a preliminary registration statement (subject to
            completion) with the SEC for an initial public offering of limited partner interests,
            the Company announced in February 2008 that the offering had been postponed due to
            market conditions. In addition to market conditions, the completion of the Company's
            plans to form the master limited partnerships is subject to numerous other risks beyond
            the control of the Company, and therefore it is possible that one or both of the master
            limited partnerships will not be formed, will not complete an offering of securities,
            will not raise the planned amount of capital even if an offering of securities is
            completed, and will not be able to complete its proposed actions. Furthermore, the
            structure, nature, purpose, proposed assets and liabilities, and proposed manner of
            offering of the master limited partnerships may change materially from those
            anticipated. In addition, the Company's retained investment in any master limited
            partnership formed would be subject to the risks normally attendant to businesses in
            the oil and gas exploration and production industry, including most of the same risks
            to which the Company is subject. The Company's announcement of its plan with respect to
            Pioneer Southwest's initial public offering did not, and this report does not,
            constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Any
            offers, solicitations of offers to buy, or any sales of securities of either master
            limited partnership will be made only in accordance with the registration requirements
            of the Securities Act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom. See "Item 7. Management's
            Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note W of
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
            and Supplementary Data" for discussions of Pioneer Southwest's proposed initial public
            offering.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

The information included in this Report about the Company's proved
            reserves as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, which were located in the United
            States, Argentina, Canada, South Africa and Tunisia, were based on evaluations prepared
            by the Company's engineers and audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc.
            ("NSAI") with respect to the Company's major properties and prepared by the Company's
            engineers with respect to all other properties. The reserve audits performed by NSAI in
            aggregate represented 86 percent, 89 percent and 82 percent of the Company's 2007, 2006
            and 2005 proved reserves, respectively; and, 80 percent, 83 percent and 76 percent of
            the Company's 2007, 2006 and 2005 associated pre-tax present value of proved reserves
            discounted at ten percent, respectively.

NSAI follows the general principles set forth in the standards
            pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserve information
            promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE"). A reserve audit as defined
            by the SPE is not the same as a financial audit. The SPE's definition of a reserve
            audit includes the following concepts:

•

A reserve audit is an examination of reserve information
                            that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to
                            whether such reserve information, in the aggregate, is reasonable and
                            has been presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
                            engineering and evaluation principles.

•

The estimation of proved reserves is an imprecise
                            science due to the many unknown geologic and reservoir factors that
                            cannot be estimated through sampling techniques. Since reserves are
                            only estimates, they cannot be audited for the purpose of verifying
                            exactness. Instead, reserve information is audited for the purpose of
                            reviewing in sufficient detail the policies, procedures and methods
                            used by a company in estimating its reserves so that the reserve
                            auditors may express an opinion as to whether, in the aggregate, the
                            reserve information furnished by a company is reasonable.

•

The methods and procedures used by a company, and the
                            reserve information furnished by a company, must be reviewed in
                            sufficient detail to permit the reserve auditor, in its professional
                            judgment, to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the reserve
                            information. The auditing procedures require the reserve auditor to
                            prepare its own estimates of reserve information for the audited
                            properties.

To further clarify, in conjunction with the audit of the Company's
            proved reserves and associated pre-tax present value discounted at ten percent, Pioneer
            provided to NSAI its external and internal engineering and geoscience technical data
            and analyses. Following NSAI's review of that data, it had the option of honoring
            Pioneer's interpretation, or making its own interpretation. No data was withheld from
            NSAI. NSAI accepted without independent verification the accuracy and completeness of
            the historical information and data furnished by Pioneer with respect to ownership
            interest; oil and gas production; well test data; commodity prices; operating and
            development costs; and any agreements relating to current and future operations of the
            properties and sales of production. However, if in the course of its evaluation
            something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency
            of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it
            had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently
            verified such information or data.

In the course of its evaluations, NSAI prepared, for all of the audited
            properties, its own estimates of the Company's proved reserves and the pre-tax present
            value of such reserves discounted at ten percent. NSAI reviewed its audit differences
            with the Company, and, in a number of cases, held joint meetings with the Company to
            review additional reserves work performed by the technical teams and any updated
            performance data related to the reserve differences. Such data was incorporated, as
            appropriate, by both parties into the reserve estimates. NSAI's estimates, including
            any adjustments resulting from additional data, of those proved reserves and the
            pre-tax present value of such reserves discounted at ten percent did not differ from
            Pioneer's estimates by more than ten percent in the aggregate. However, when compared
            on a lease-by-lease, field-by-field or area-by-area basis, some of the Company's
            estimates were greater than those of NSAI and some were less than the estimates of
            NSAI. When such differences do not exceed ten percent in the aggregate and NSAI is
            satisfied that the proved reserves and pre-tax present value of such reserves
            discounted at ten percent are reasonable and that its audit objectives have been met,
            NSAI will issue an unqualified audit opinion. Remaining differences are not resolved
            due to the limited cost benefit of continuing such analyses by the Company and NSAI. At
            the conclusion of the audit process, it was NSAI's opinion, as set forth in its audit
            letter, that Pioneer's estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves
            and


associated pre-tax future net revenues discounted at ten percent are, in
            the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with petroleum

The Company did not provide estimates of total proved oil and gas
            reserves during 2007, 2006 or 2005 to any federal authority or agency, other than the
            SEC. The Company's reserve estimates do not include any probable or possible reserves.
            Also, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Critical Accounting Estimates" in "Item 7.
            Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations" for additional
            discussions regarding proved reserves and their related cash flows.

Proved Reserves

The Company's proved reserves totaled 963.8 MMBOE, 904.9 MMBOE and 986.7
            MMBOE at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing $9.0 billion,
            $4.7 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively, of Standardized Measure. The Company's
            proved reserves include field fuel, which is gas consumed to operate field equipment
            (primarily compressors) prior to the gas being delivered to a sales point. The
            following table shows the changes in the Company's proved reserve volumes by geographic
            area during the year ended December 31, 2007 (in MBOE):

Production.

Production volumes
            include 2,891 MBOE of field fuel and 2,950 MBOE of production associated with divested
            assets being presented as discontinued operations.

Extensions and discoveries.

Extensions and discoveries are primarily the result of extension
            drilling in the Raton field and Spraberry field in the United States and the Horseshoe
            Canyon field in Canada and lower-risk exploratory drilling in the Company's South Texas
            Edwards Trend and Tunisian resource plays.

Purchases of minerals-in-place.

Purchases of minerals-in-place are primarily attributable to bolt-on
            acquisitions in the Company's Spraberry oil field, Raton gas field and the entry into
            the Barnett Shale gas field.

Sales of minerals-in-place.

Sales of
            minerals-in-place are principally related to the Company's divestiture of its Canadian
            assets and the Tunisian government's election to participate in 50 percent of the
            Company's discoveries in the Cherouq concession in the Jenein Nord permit. See Note N
            of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
            and Supplementary Data."

Revisions of previous estimates.

Revisions of previous estimates are comprised of 20 MMBOE of positive
            price revisions offset by 2 MMBOE of negative technical revisions. The Company's proved
            reserves at December 31, 2007 were determined using year-end NYMEX equivalent prices of
            $95.92 per barrel of oil and $6.80 per Mcf of gas, compared to $60.82 per barrel of oil
            and $5.64 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 2006.


On a BOE basis, 62
            percent of the Company's total proved reserves at December 31, 2007 were proved
            developed reserves. Based on reserve information as of December 31, 2007, and using the
            Company's production information for the year then ended, excluding production
            associated with divested assets included in discontinued operations, the
            reserve-to-production ratio associated with the Company's proved reserves was in excess
            of 20 years on a BOE basis. The following table provides information regarding the
            Company's proved reserves and average daily sales volumes by geographic area as of and

Description of Properties

United States

Approximately 89 percent of the Company's proved reserves at December
            31, 2007 are located in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin area, the Hugoton and
            West Panhandle fields in the Mid-Continent area and the Raton field in the Rocky
            Mountains area. These fields generate substantial operating cash flow and the Spraberry
            and Raton fields have a large portfolio of low-risk drilling opportunities. The cash
            flows generated from these fields provide funding for the Company's other development
            and exploration activities both domestically and internationally.

Permian Basin

Spraberry field.

The Spraberry field
            was discovered in 1949 and encompasses eight counties in West Texas. The field is
            approximately 150 miles long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is
            West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average
            energy content of 1,400 Btu. The oil and gas are produced primarily from three
            formations, the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from 6,700
            feet to 9,200 feet. In addition, the Company has started completing the majority of its
            wells in the Wolfcamp formation at depths ranging from 9,300 feet to 10,300 feet with
            successful results. The Company believes the Spraberry field offers excellent
            opportunities to enhance oil and gas production because of the numerous undeveloped
            drilling locations, many of which are reflected in the Company's proved undeveloped
            reserves, and the ability to contain operating expenses and drilling costs through
            economies of scale.


During July 2007, the Company entered into an agreement under which the
            Company has the option to purchase an additional 22 percent interest in the Spraberry
            Midkiff-Benedum gas processing system for $230 million, subject to normal closing
            adjustments. The additional 22 percent can be purchased in 2008 and 2009 and, if
            exercised, will increase the Company's interest in the system to 49 percent. In
            conjunction with this transaction, the Company extended its percent of proceeds ("POP")
            contract with the plant to 2022 and negotiated incremental increases in the Company's
            POP beginning in 2009.

In December 2007, the Company acquired approximately 44,000 gross acres
            in the Spraberry field for $89.4 million, with Pioneer being operator of the acquired
            properties. Proved reserves associated with the acquisition are approximately 15 MMBOE.
            The Company estimates that the acquisition provides more than 600 potential drilling
            locations utilizing 40-acre spacing.

During 2007, the Company (a) drilled 350 wells, an increase of over 17
            percent compared to 2006, (b) acquired approximately 185,000 gross acres, bringing its
            total acreage position to approximately 869,000 gross acres (688,000 net acres), (c)
            completed several bolt-on property acquisitions and joint ventures and (d) successfully
            drilled a majority of the wells to the Wolfcamp formation. The Company plans to drill
            approximately 350 wells in 2008 and continue to pursue acreage expansions and bolt-on
            acquisitions.

Mid-Continent

Hugoton field.

The Hugoton field in
            southwest Kansas is one of the largest producing gas fields in the continental United
            States. The gas is produced from the Chase and Council Grove formations at depths
            ranging from 2,700 feet to 3,000 feet. The Company's gas in the Hugoton field has an
            average energy content of 1,025
            Btu

.

The
            Company's Hugoton properties are located on approximately 285,000 gross acres (247,000
            net acres), covering approximately 400 square miles. The Company has working interests
            in approximately 1,200 wells in the Hugoton field, approximately 990 of which it
            operates, and partial royalty interests in approximately 500 wells. The Company owns
            substantially all of the gathering and processing facilities, primarily the Satanta
            plant, which service its production from the Hugoton field. Such ownership allows the
            Company to control the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and NGL
            production.

The Company's Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing
            approximately 65 MMcf of wet gas per day (i.e., gas production at the wellhead before
            processing or field fuel use and before reduction for royalties). Pioneer successfully
            led a cooperative effort with other operators in this field to effect rule changes
            which will enable further field development in future years. As part of the rule
            changes, the state-regulated production allowables were canceled as of December 31,
            2007, and the Company received regulatory approval to commingle production from the
            Panoma and Council Grove formations. A commingling pilot program has been initiated and
            the Company is monitoring its production performance. To capitalize on these rule
            changes, future completion designs are being developed and continued optimization is
            planned for the existing field compression system.

West Panhandle field.

The West
            Panhandle properties are located in the panhandle region of Texas. These stable,
            long-lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite, Granite Wash and
            fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500 feet. The Company's gas in
            the West Panhandle field has an average energy content of 1,365 Btuand is produced from
            approximately 675 wells on more than 250,000 gross acres (240,000 net acres) covering
            over 375 square miles. The Company controls 100 percent of the wells, production
            equipment, gathering system and the Fain gas processing plant for the field. As this
            field is operated at or below vacuum conditions, Pioneer continually works to improve
            compressor / gathering system efficiency. As part of this effort, approximately 17
            miles of 16 inch pipeline was recently replaced in the heart of the field. The Company
            received regulatory relief in parts of the West Panhandle field to allow for future
            infill drilling locations.


Rocky
            Mountains

Raton field.

The Raton Basin
            properties are located in the southeast portion of Colorado. Exploration for CBM in the
            Raton Basin began in the late 1970s and continued through the late 1980s, with several
            companies drilling and testing more than 100 wells during this period. The absence of a
            pipeline to transport gas from the Raton Basin prevented full scale development until
            January 1995, when Colorado Interstate Gas Company completed the construction of the
            Picketwire lateral pipeline system. The Company's gas in the Raton Basin has an average
            energy content of 1,000 Btu. Since the completion of the Picketwire lateral, production
            has continued to grow, resulting in expansion of the system's capacity by its operator,
            the most recent expansion of which was in 2005. The Company owns approximately 318,000
            gross acres (231,000 net acres) in the center of the Raton Basin with current
            production from coal seams in the Vermejo and Raton formations. The Company owns the
            majority of the well servicing and frac equipment that it utilizes in the Raton field
            to control costs and insure availability. In the Raton field, the Company sells its gas
            at a Mid-Continent index price which historically has generally provided higher
            realized gas prices as compared to the Rockies-based indexes.

In December 2007, the Company acquired approximately 30,000 net acres in
            the Raton Basin for $205.3 million. The acquired acreage has approximately 95 Bcf of
            proved reserves.

During 2007, the Company (a) drilled 230 wells, and put 301 wells on
            production, (b) added wellhead compression and (c) continued efforts to optimize
            gathering and compression facilities. During 2008, the Company expects to complete
            approximately 175 wells.

Piceance/Uinta Basins.

The Piceance
            Basin is located in the central portion of western Colorado, and the Uinta Basin is
            located in the central portion of eastern Utah. The Company owns approximately 244,000
            gross acres covering producing and prospective regions of the Piceance and Uinta
            Basins. Currently, production is established from various tight sandstone, coal and
            shale formations. The Company's significant projects in the area are CBM plays at
            Columbine Springs and Castlegate and a deep gas play at Main Canyon.

Sand Wash Basin.

The Sand Wash Basin
            is the site of a potential CBM project located north of the Company's Piceance Basin
            properties. The Company holds a 50 percent operated interest in 114,000 gross acres in
            the Lay Creek field. At Lay Creek, the Company has drilled 18 wells in six separate
            pilot areas and completed workovers and recompletions on 14 wells drilled by a previous
            operator. The Company completed the water treatment facilities and initiated sales of
            production in 2007. Determination of success of the pilot project is dependent on the
            ability to dewater the formation and determine if commercial quantities of gas can be
            produced. The pilot project is currently in the dewatering phase and a determination of
            commerciality should be known by the end of 2008.

Gas prices.

In general, industry
            drilling success in the Rocky Mountains area (which affects the Company's properties in
            the Piceance/Uinta Basins and Sand Wash Basin) has created more supply than can be
            transported by the currently available pipeline infrastructure. As a result, gas prices
            in the region have experienced greater volatility and at the end of the third quarter
            of 2007 spot gas prices for the area were approximately $.60 per MMBtu. As a result of
            the extremely low gas prices during September and October of 2007, the Company shut-in
            approximately 5 to 6 MMcfpd of gas production in the Uinta/Piceance area. Additional
            pipeline capacity was added in the first quarter of 2008 with the start-up of the
            Rockies Express pipeline, which should alleviate the capacity constraints, allowing
            more gas to reach consumer markets at improved price levels. Prices have rebounded in
            the area since September 30, 2007 and the Company believes that gas prices will
            continue to improve as a result of the Rockies Express pipeline being in
            service.

Onshore Gulf Coast

South Texas.

In 2007, the South
            Texas drilling program focused on the Edwards Trend, a tight gas limestone reservoir
            characterized by narrow bands of dry gas fields extending over 250 miles in length. The
            Company's drilling activity occurred in both established areas such as Pawnee field and
            growth areas along the Trend. To date the Company has acquired over 305,000 gross acres
            in the Edwards Trend. In addition to the Pawnee field, the Company has operations in
            the SW Kenedy, Sawfish, Word, Three Rivers and Washburn fields. Production depths in
            the Edwards Trend range from 9,500 feet to 14,500 feet.

During 2007, the Company drilled 20 exploration and appraisal wells
            targeting new field discoveries in the Edwards Trend growth areas with 100 percent
            success, exceeding expectations and increasing proved gas reserves. Nine of these new
            wells have been added to production, three wells are awaiting pipelines or testing,
            four are


awaiting stimulation, and four are waiting on the horizontal lateral
            portion of the well to be completed. In previously established areas, including the
            Pawnee field, 14 wells were drilled with 100 percent success.

The acquisition of 3-D seismic data has significantly enhanced field
            development in all areas of the Edwards Trend, allowing the Company to more accurately
            locate and orient the horizontal wells for optimal results. To expand its 3-D data
            coverage to include new discoveries and additional prospects, the Company is in the
            process of shooting and interpreting approximately 900 square miles of new data.
            Multiple surveys were completed in 2007 and more are planned for 2008.

In order to accommodate its rapidly growing Edwards Trend production,
            the Company significantly expanded its existing gas gathering and processing
            infrastructure during 2007. The expansion included over 30 miles of gathering system
            and three additional treating facilities were installed.

In 2008, the Company expects a comparable drilling program to that in
            2007. Also planned are additional facilities expansions to accommodate increasing
            production.

Mississippi.

The Company has built
            an acreage position covering multiple plays in the Mississippi Salt Basin and now holds
            leases and option interests covering approximately 150,000 net acres. Over the next two
            to three years, the Company expects to test a number of opportunities and to continue
            technical work that is currently underway.

The Company drilled two successful Cotton Valley wells in the Bolton
            field and installed a gas treating facility to process the gas. The Company is
            permitting for a 3-D seismic shoot in 2008 for the Bolton field to better define the
            resource potential and future drilling plans.

Barnett Shale

During 2007, the Company participated in the drilling of six successful
            exploration wells on its approximate 9,300 gross acres in the Barnett Shale play that
            it acquired in the second quarter of 2007.

In December 2007, the Company expanded its Barnett Shale acreage
            position by completing a $144.3 million acquisition. The Company estimates proved
            reserves on the acreage to be approximately 13.5 MMBOE. The acreage being acquired
            contains more than 300 potential drilling locations, with most locations covered by 3-D
            seismic data.

The Company's total holdings in the Barnett Shale play now approximate
            80,000 gross acres, with more than 450 potential drilling locations. The Company plans
            to drill 20 wells in 2008 with the expectation of increasing its drilling program in
            2009.

Alaska

Oooguruk.

In 2002, the Company
            acquired a 70 percent working interest and operatorship in ten state leases on Alaska's
            North Slope, and in 2003 drilled three exploratory wells to test a possible extension
            of the productive sands in the Kuparuk River field in the shallow waters offshore the
            North Slope of Alaska. Although all three of the wells found the sands filled with oil,
            they were too thin to be considered commercial on a stand-alone basis. However, the
            wells also encountered thick sections of oil-bearing Jurassic-aged sands, and the first
            well flowed at a rate of approximately 1,300 Bbls per day. In January 2004, the Company
            farmed-into a large acreage block to the southwest of the Company's discovery. In 2004,
            Pioneer completed an extensive technical and economic evaluation of the resource
            potential within this area. As a result of this evaluation, the Company performed
            front-end engineering and permitting activities during 2005 to further define the scope
            of the project. In early 2006, the Company announced that it had approved the
            development of the Oooguruk field in the project area.

The Company constructed and armored the gravel drilling and production
            island site in 2006. Installation of a subsea flowline and production facilities to
            carry produced liquids to existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk River
            Unit was completed in 2007. Pioneer assembled the drilling rig on location and
            commenced drilling the first of approximately 40 horizontal development and injector
            wells in December of 2007. The Company estimates that first production will occur
            during the first half of 2008 and that first sales will occur mid-year 2008. During
            2008, the Company expects to drill 13 to 15 of the 40 planned wells.

Cosmopolitan.

In 2005, the Company
            acquired an interest in the Cosmopolitan Unit in the Cook Inlet of Alaska. Through a
            series of transactions, the Company now owns 100 percent of the Cosmopolitan Unit.
            The


previous operator of the Cosmopolitan Unit had an oil discovery for
            which economic viability was not determined. During 2005 and 2006, the Company
            completed and interpreted a 3-D seismic shoot. During 2007, the Company drilled a
            lateral sidetrack from an existing wellbore at an onshore site to further appraise the
            resource potential of the unit. The initial unstimulated production test results were
            encouraging. The Company plans to begin permitting activities and continue facilities
            planning during 2008 for a future potential development of the project and to drill
            another appraisal well in 2009.

Onshore North Slope area.

During the
            2006-2007 winter drilling season, the Company participated in drilling two exploratory
            wells in the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska ("NPRA") area, both of which were
            noncommercial.

Gulf of Mexico

Gulf of Mexico area.

During 2005,
            the Company announced a discovery on its Clipper prospect in the Green Canyon Blocks
            299 and 300 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. During 2006, the Company drilled two
            successful Clipper appraisal wells, but drilled an unsuccessful exploratory well at the
            Flying Cloud prospect, a prospect near the Clipper discovery. The Company began
            evaluation plans for the potential development of the discovery, but projected capital
            costs for the project doubled during the evaluation, which resulted in the Company
            electing to not pursue the development of the Clipper project. Accordingly, the Company
            recognized an exploration and abandonment charge of $72.1 million in the fourth quarter
            of 2007.

As a result of Hurricane Rita, the Company's East Cameron facility,
            located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, was destroyed. Operations to reclaim and abandon
            the East Cameron facility began in 2007. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company
            increased the estimated cost to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility by $66.0
            million to an aggregate estimated cost of $185 million. The estimate to reclaim and
            abandon the East Cameron facility is based upon an analysis prepared by a third-party
            engineering firm for the majority of the work, an estimate by the Company for the
            remaining work that was not covered by the third-party analysis and actual abandonment
            activity to date. See Note U of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
            "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information on the
            East Cameron 322 facility.

International

The Company's international operations are located offshore South Africa
            and onshore in southern Tunisia. Additionally, the Company has an exploration permit in
            Equatorial Guinea. During 2007, the Company also disposed of its interests in Block 320
            in Nigeria, and relinquished its remaining interest in Block 256 in Nigeria due to
            unsuccessful exploratory drilling results. The Company is currently winding up its
            efforts to exit Nigeria completely. In November 2007, the Company closed the sale of
            all of the Company's common stock in its Canadian subsidiaries for net proceeds of
            $525.7 million, resulting in a gain of $101.3 million. See Notes N, S and V of Notes to
            Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
            Supplementary Data" for a description of the Nigerian and Canadian divestitures. As of
            December 31, 2007, approximately three percent of the Company's proved reserves were
            located in Africa.

___________

(a)

Includes $10.5 million of capitalized interest related
                            to the South Coast Gas project.

South Africa.

The Company has
            agreements to explore for oil and gas covering over 3.6 million acres offshore the
            southern coast of South Africa in water depths generally less than 650 feet. The Sable
            oil field began producing in August 2003 and the majority of the gas from the field has
            been reinjected. The Company has a 40 percent working interest in the Sable
            field.

In 2005, the Company sanctioned the non-operated South Coast Gas
            development project, which includes the subsea tie-back of gas from the Sable field and
            five additional gas accumulations to an existing production facility on the F-A
            platform for transportation via existing pipelines to a gas-to-liquids plant. Pioneer
            has a 45 percent working interest in the project. As part of sanctioning of the South
            Coast Gas project, the Company signed a six-year contract for the sale of all of its
            gas and condensate production from the project. The contract contains an obligation for
            the purchaser to take or pay for a total of 91.4 BCF and associated condensate if the
            anticipated deliverability estimates are achieved. The price for both gas and
            condensate is indexed to Brent oil prices. During 2007, two additional wells were
            drilled and installation of pipeline and facilities infrastructure was completed as
            part of the South Coast Gas project. First production from the South Coast Gas project
            was achieved in the third quarter of 2007 at approximately 15 to 20 MMcfpd (gross). It
            is expected that the simultaneous production of both oil and gas from the Sable field
            will increase the ultimately recoverable oil reserves.

A significant portion of the gas reserves associated with the South
            Coast Gas project is in the Sable field. Initially, the gas production from the Sable
            field was not expected to commence until the oil production was completed. However, as
            a result of production performance from the Sable field and improved oil prices, which
            have had the effect of extending the economic life of the Sable oil field, facilities
            modifications are being planned that would allow for the simultaneous production of oil
            and gas from the Sable field. The modifications are currently expected to be completed
            in late 2008 or early 2009.


Tunisia.

The Company holds interests
            in four separate onshore permits located in the southern portion of Tunisia. These
            permits cover a gross area of approximately 11,900 square kilometers containing two
            production concessions targeting the Acacus formation with additional future upside
            exploration potential from this and other formations.

•

Jenein Nord Permit and Cherouq Concession.

The Jenein Nord Permit covers approximately 1,200 square
                            kilometers. Over the past two years, the Company has conducted an
                            intensive exploration program over the area. As a result of an
                            aggressive seismic data acquisition and exploration drilling program,
                            the Company achieved a significant number of hydrocarbon discoveries.
                            Based on the success, the Company, along with the government oil
                            agency, Enterprise Tunisienne d'Activities Petrolieres ("ETAP"),
                            submitted a joint application on November 10, 2007 to the Directeur
                            Général de l'Energie for the development of a portion of
                            the permit area called the Cherouq Concession.

On December 17, 2007, the Consultative Committee of Hydrocarbons, the
            advisory committee to the Directeur Général de l'Energie, approved the
            Cherouq Concession resulting in the Company and ETAP each holding a 50 percent working
            interest in the concession. The concession covers approximately 760 square kilometers
            of the Jenein Nord Permit. During 2007, the Company drilled seven exploration wells and
            first production from the concession was achieved in late fourth quarter
            2007.

The Company plans to drill up to seven additional wells and acquire an
            additional 295 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data over the Cherouq Concession during
            2008.

•

Borj El Khadra Permit and Adam Concession.

The Borj El Khadra Permit, including the Adam
                            Concession, covers approximately 2,900 square kilometers. Production
                            from the Adam Concession began in May 2003, for which the Company now
                            has a 20 percent working interest. During 2007, the Company continued
                            its exploratory and appraisal activities on the Adam Concession by
                            drilling four wells, of which all were successful, and completed
                            drilling of two wells in the Borj El Khadra Permit, of which one was
                            successful. The Company plans to drill an additional four wells in the
                            Adam Concession and two wells in the Borj El Khadra exploration permit
                            during 2008.

•

El Hamra Permit.

The El
                            Hamra exploration permit covers approximately 4,000 square kilometers,
                            of which the Company is operator with a 50 percent working interest
                            during the exploration period. In 2007, the Company completed the
                            acquisition of 310 kilometers of seismic data and began processing the
                            data. Processing and interpretation of the seismic data is scheduled to
                            be completed during the second quarter of 2008. The Company anticipates
                            drilling an exploration well in the second half of 2008.

•

Anaguid Permit.

The Anaguid
                            exploration permit covers approximately 3,800 square kilometers. In
                            2007, the Company acquired an additional 15 percent interest in the
                            Anaguid exploration permit, thereby increasing its interest to 60
                            percent (during the exploration period) and resulting in the transfer
                            of operations to Pioneer. The Company intends to acquire an additional
                            900 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data and expects to drill up to
                            two exploration wells in the second half of 2008.

Equatorial Guinea.

The Company owns
            a 50 percent interest in Block H in deepwater Equatorial Guinea, which covers over
            240,000 acres. In late 2006, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea ratified a new
            hydrocarbons law, which among other things, appears to entitle Equatorial Guinea to
            increase substantially its carried interest in all concessions, including Block H. In
            addition, drilling costs have increased significantly beyond those originally
            anticipated. Given these and other facts, the Company and the other participants in the
            block have been unable to reach an agreement as to their respective rights and
            obligations under a joint operating agreement relating to the well operations in the
            block and as a result, the parties have commenced arbitration. In connection with the
            ongoing arbitration among the parties, the Company recognized an impairment charge of
            approximately $10.3 million to write off its remaining basis in Block H. See Note I of
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
            and Supplementary Data" for specific information regarding the Company's arbitration
            associated with Block H.


Selected Oil and Gas Information

The following tables set forth selected oil and gas information from
            continuing operations for the Company as of and for each of the years ended December
            31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased
            drilling activities and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical
            information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future
            results.

Production, price and cost data.

The
            following tables set forth production, price and cost data with respect to the
            Company's properties for 2007, 2006 and 2005. These amounts represent the Company's

__________

(a)

Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells
                            capable of production, including shut-in wells. One or more completions
                            in the same well bore are counted as one well. If any well in which one
                            of the multiple completions is an oil completion, then the well is
                            classified as an oil well. As of December 31, 2007, the Company owned
                            interests in seven gross wells containing multiple
                            completions.

(b)

Acres subject to expiration during 2008 include 827,308
                            gross acres (201,341 net acres) in Tunisia and 198,889 gross acres
                            (153,427 net acres) in North America. In Tunisia, the Company has
                            received extensions, plans to make the necessary expenditures to extend
                            the acreage or intends to seek extensions on the 2008 expirations. As
                            to the remaining acreage, the Company may extend the leases prior to
                            their expiration based upon 2008 planned activities or for other
                            business reasons. In certain leases, the extension is only subject to
                            the Company's election to extend and the fulfillment of certain capital
                            expenditures commitments. In other cases, the extensions are subject to
                            the consent of third parties, and no assurance can be given that the
                            requested extensions will be granted. See "Description of Properties"
                            above for information regarding the Company's drilling
                            operations.

Drilling activities.

The following
            table sets forth the number of gross and net productive and dry hole wells in which the
            Company had an interest that were drilled during 2007, 2006 and 2005. This information
            should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed
            that there was any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and the
            oil and gas reserves generated thereby or the costs to the Company of productive wells
            compared to the costs of dry holes.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                            CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Financial and Operating Performance

Pioneer's financial and operating performance for 2007
                            included the following highlights:

•

As a result of the gain recognized on the sale of
                            deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets during 2006, partially
                            offset by the gain recognized on the Canadian divestiture in 2007, net
                            income decreased 50 percent to $372.7 million ($3.06 per diluted share)
                            in 2007 from $739.7 million ($5.81 per diluted share) in
                            2006.

•

Income from continuing operations increased to $242.0
                            million ($1.99 per diluted share) for 2007, as compared to $150.2
                            million ($1.19 per diluted share) for 2006, primarily due to higher oil
                            and gas revenues.

•

Average daily sales volumes, on a BOE basis, increased
                            eight percent in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to successful
                            drilling programs and a five percent decrease in the delivery of VPP
                            volumes.

•

Oil and gas revenues increased $281.9 million, or 19
                            percent in 2007, as compared to 2006, due to a combination of increased
                            production and increases in worldwide commodity prices.

•

The Company completed the divestiture of the Company's
                            Canadian subsidiary for net proceeds of $525.7 million, resulting in a
                            gain of $101.3 million.

•

The Company recognized income from discontinued
                            operations of $130.7 million ($1.07 per diluted share) during 2007,
                            primarily attributable to the sale of Canadian assets, as compared to
                            income from discontinued operations of $589.5 million ($4.62 per
                            diluted share) during 2006, which included the sale of the deepwater
                            Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets.

•

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by
                            $20.5 million, or three percent as compared to that of 2006, primarily
                            due to increased sales volumes, increased commodity prices and $74.9
                            million of income realized from the disposal of Alaskan PPT credits,
                            offset by the cash provided by operating activities associated with the
                            2006 deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine asset dispositions and the
                            2007 disposal of the Canadian assets.

•

The Company added 147.9 MMBOE of proved reserves during
                            2007, resulting in total proved reserves of 963.8 MMBOE at December 31,
                            2007.

•

The Company commenced production at the South Coast Gas
                            Project in South Africa late in the third quarter of 2007.

•

The construction and installation of facilities at the
                            Company's Alaskan Oooguruk project was completed and drilling was
                            initiated in December 2007 with first production on schedule for the
                            first half of 2008, with first sales expected mid 2008.

•

The Company acquired oil and gas properties that
                            complemented the Company's exploration and development drilling
                            activities with significant acquisitions in the Spraberry field, Raton
                            field and the Barnett Shale play of approximately $439
                            million.


            Outlook and Activities

Commodity prices.

Significant
            factors that may impact future commodity prices include: developments in the issues
            currently impacting Iraq and Iran and the Middle East in general; the extent to which
            members of the OPEC and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil
            supply through export quotas; and overall North American gas supply and demand
            fundamentals, including the impact of weather conditions and increasing LNG deliveries
            to the United States. Although the Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that
            may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be
            affected, the prices for any commodity that the Company produces will generally
            approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time
            to time, Pioneer expects that it may hedge a portion of its commodity price risk to
            mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues. See Note J of
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
            and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's commodity
            hedge positions at December 31, 2007. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
            Disclosures About Market Risk" for disclosures about the Company's commodity related
            derivative financial instruments.

Capital budget for 2008.

The Company
            announced a 2008 capital budget of $1.0 billion, excluding acquisitions, effects of
            asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical
            administrative costs. The 2008 capital budget is significantly less than 2007 capital
            spending levels, excluding acquisitions, due to the completion of facilities
            construction for both the South Coast Gas project off the coast of South Africa and the
            Oooguruk project on the North Slope of Alaska, the sale of all Canadian assets and the
            elimination of higher-risk exploration. Approximately 90 percent of the 2008 capital
            budget will be focused on low-risk development drilling and resource play extensions in
            Pioneer's four core onshore areas (Spraberry, Raton, Edwards Trend and Tunisia). The
            remaining ten percent will be focused primarily on development drilling in the Oooguruk
            project and Barnett Shale drilling. For 2008, the Company currently expects that cash
            flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the $1.0 billion capital
            budget.

2008 Annual
            Production.

The Company
            believes that the results from its 2007 drilling program and 2008 capital budget will
            allow the Company to realize production growth per share during 2008 of 12 percent or
            more as compared to the Company's 2007 production per share.

First Quarter 2008 Outlook.

Based on
            current estimates, the Company expects that first quarter 2008 production will average
            103,000 to 109,000 BOEPD. The range reflects the typical variability in the timing of
            oil cargo shipments in South Africa and Tunisia.

First quarter production costs (including production and ad valorem
            taxes and transportation costs) are expected to average $11.75 to $12.75 per BOE based
            on NYMEX strip prices for oil, NGLs and gas at the time of the estimate. Depletion,
            depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expense is expected to average $10.75 to
            $11.75 per BOE.

Total exploration and abandonment expense for the quarter is expected to
            be $40 million to $70 million including (i) up to $40 million from activities in the
            Company's resource plays in the Edwards Trend in South Texas, the Rockies area and
            Tunisia and (ii) up to $30 million in seismic investments and personnel costs,
            primarily in the Edwards Trend and Tunisia resource plays. General and administrative
            expense is expected to be $32 million to $36 million. Interest expense is expected to
            be $35 million to $40 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is
            expected to be $2 million to $3 million.

The Company's first quarter effective income tax rate is expected to
            range from 40 percent to 45 percent based on current capital spending plans and higher
            tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions. Cash income taxes are expected to range
            from $10 million to $15 million, principally related to Tunisian income
            taxes.

Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. Initial Public
            Offering

. On January 8, 2008, Pioneer Southwest Energy
            Partners L.P. ("Pioneer Southwest"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed an amendment to
            its registration statement (subject to completion) with the SEC to sell limited partner
            interests. If the offering is completed, Pioneer Southwest would own interests in
            certain oil and gas properties currently owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in
            the Permian Basin of West Texas. Pioneer Southwest's registration statement
            contemplates an offering of 7,500,000 common units representing a 35.3 percent limited
            partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. Upon completion of this offering, the Company
            would own a 0.1 percent general partner interest and a 64.6 percent limited partner
            interest in Pioneer Southwest. The underwriters would be granted a 30-day option to
            purchase up to 1,125,000 additional common units. The Company's limited partner
            interest would be reduced to 61.4 percent if the


underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. Assuming an
            initial public offering price of $20.00 per common unit and that the underwriters
            exercise their over-allotment option, estimated gross proceeds from the offering would
            be $150 million. In February 2008, the Company announced that the initial public
            offering of common units of Pioneer Southwest has been postponed due to market
            conditions and timing of the offering remains uncertain. There can be no assurance that
            Pioneer Southwest will complete the offering, or if completed, that the offering will
            be structured as described above.

This report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of
            an offer to buy any securities of Pioneer Southwest. Any offers, solicitations of
            offers to buy, or any sales of securities of Pioneer Southwest will be made only in
            accordance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 or an
            exemption therefrom.

Acquisitions

2007 acquisition expenditures.

During 2007, the Company spent approximately $536.7 million to acquire
            proved and unproved properties. The acquisitions primarily added proved reserves and
            increased the Company's acreage positions in the Spraberry field, Raton field and
            Barnett Shale play.

2006 acquisition expenditures.

During 2006, the Company spent approximately $223.2 million to acquire
            proved and unproved properties, which was comprised of approximately $144.8 million of
            proved properties and $78.3 million of unproved properties. The proved properties were
            primarily bolt-on and acreage acquisitions in the Spraberry field and Edwards Trend
            area. In North America, the acquisition of unproved properties is comprised of acreage
            acquisitions in the Spraberry field, Edwards Trend area, Rockies area, Alaska and
            Canada. The Company also acquired an additional interest in its Jenein Nord block in
            Tunisia and recognized additional obligations associated with its Nigerian prospects
            during 2006.

2005 acquisition expenditures.

During 2005, the Company spent approximately $272.9 million to acquire
            proved and unproved properties, which was comprised of approximately $173.4 million of
            proved properties and approximately $99.5 million of unproved properties.

Divestitures

Canada.

In November 2007, the
            Company sold its Canadian subsidiaries for $525.7 million, resulting in a gain of
            $101.3 million. The historic results of these assets and the related gain on
            disposition are reported as discontinued operations.

Nigeria.

In prior years, a
            subsidiary of the Company joined other companies in a production sharing contract
            covering the oil prospecting license for Block 320 in deepwater Nigeria, gaining
            exploration rights from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. During the third
            quarter of 2007, the Company disposed of all its shares in the subsidiary holding Block
            320. As a result of the disposition of the shares in the Nigerian subsidiary, the
            Company no longer owns any interest in Block 320 and will not fund or participate in
            any future operations in connection with Block 320.

Argentina and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

During March 2006, the Company sold its interests in certain oil and gas
            properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $1.2 billion, resulting
            in a gain of $725.3 million. During April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets
            for net proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9 million. The historic
            results of these properties and the related gains on disposition are reported as
            discontinued operations.

Volumetric production payments.

During 2005, the Company sold 27.8 MMBOE of proved reserves in the
            Hugoton and Spraberry fields, by means of three VPPs for net proceeds of $892.6
            million, including the assignment of the Company's obligations under certain derivative
            hedge agreements.

The Company's VPPs represent limited-term overriding royalty interests
            in oil and gas reserves that: (i) entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes
            over a period of time from specific lease interests; (ii) are free and clear of all
            associated future production costs and capital expenditures; (iii) are nonrecourse to
            the Company (i.e., the purchaser's only recourse is to the reserves acquired); (iv)
            transfers title of the reserves to the purchaser and (v) allows the Company to retain
            the remaining reserves after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered. Based
            on the scheduled production deliveries, the multiple VPPs are scheduled to be completed
            between 2009 and 2012.


Canada and Shelf Gulf of Mexico.

During 2005, the Company sold its interests in the Martin Creek and
            Conroy Black areas of northeast British Columbia and the Lookout Butte area of southern
            Alberta for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in a gain of $138.3 million.
            During 2005, the Company also sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas
            properties on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net proceeds of $59.2 million, resulting in
            a gain of $27.9 million. The historic results of these properties and the related gains
            on disposition are reported as discontinued operations.

Gabon divestiture.

In 2005, the
            Company closed the sale of the shares in a Gabonese subsidiary that owns the interest
            in the Olowi block for $47.9 million of net proceeds, resulting in a gain of $47.5
            million with no associated income tax effect either in Gabon or the United States.
            During 2007, Pioneer relinquished its rights to receive additional payments for
            production discovered from deeper reservoirs on the block in consideration for a
            release of certain obligations.

Results of Operations

Oil and gas revenues.

Oil and gas
            revenues totaled $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion during 2007, 2006 and
            2005, respectively. The revenue increase during 2007, as compared to 2006, was
            primarily reflective of increases in United States and Tunisian revenues, partially
            offset by decreases in South African revenues. The increase in United States revenues
            was primarily due to an increase in average daily sales volumes resulting from
            successful drilling programs and reductions in scheduled volumetric production payment
            ("VPP") deliveries, combined with an 18 percent increase in reported NGL prices and an
            18 percent increase in reported gas prices. The increase in Tunisian revenues resulted
            from an increase in average daily sales volumes from successful drilling efforts and a
            12 percent increase in average reported prices. South African revenues declined due to
            normal production decline rates in the Sable field and the timing of oil cargo
            liftings, partially offset by increases in average reported oil prices and initial gas
            production from the South Coast Gas project. The revenue increase during 2006, as
            compared to 2005, was due to a 70 percent increase in reported oil prices and an 11
            percent increase in NGL prices. Partially offsetting the effects of increased oil and
            NGL prices was an 11 percent decrease in reported gas prices and a four percent
            decrease in average daily sales volumes on a BOE basis.

A significant factor contributing to the increases in reported oil
            prices and decreases in reported oil sales volumes in 2006 as compared to 2005 was the
            initiation of first deliveries of oil volumes under the Company's VPP agreements in
            January 2006. VPP gas deliveries were initiated during February 2005 and declined by
            three percent during 2006, as compared to that of 2005. In accordance with GAAP, VPP
            deliveries result in VPP deferred revenue amortization being recognized in oil and gas
            revenues with no associated sales volumes being recorded.

The following table provides average daily sales volumes from continuing
            operations by geographic area and in total, for 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Hedging activities.

The Company,
            from time to time, utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to (i) reduce
            the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii)
            support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce
            commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During 2007, 2006 and
            2005, the Company's commodity price hedges decreased oil and gas revenues from
            continuing operations by $83.5 million, $151.2 million and $284.8 million,
            respectively. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of the Company's
            commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders' equity
            until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective
            portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the Company's reported
            stockholders' equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated. See Note J of
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
            and Supplementary Data" for information concerning the impact to oil and gas revenues
            during 2007, 2006 and 2005 from the Company's hedging activities, the Company's open
            and terminated hedge positions at December 31, 2007 and descriptions of the Company's
            commodity hedge derivatives. Also see


"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"
            for additional disclosures about the Company's commodity related derivative financial
            instruments.

Subsequent to December 31, 2007, the Company entered into additional
            commodity swap contracts for approximately 69,945 MMBtu per day of the Company's 2008
            production at an average price of $7.28 per MMBtu. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated
            Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"
            for information concerning these changes in gas hedge positions.

Deferred revenue

.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company's recognition of previously
            deferred VPP revenue increased oil and gas revenues from continuing operations by
            $181.2 million, $190.3 million and $75.8 million, respectively. The Company's
            amortization of deferred VPP revenue is scheduled to increase 2008 oil and gas revenues
            by $158.1 million. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
            "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for specific information
            regarding the Company's VPPs.

Interest and other income.

The
            Company's interest and other income totaled $94.7 million, $48.4 million and $26.5
            million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $46.3 million increase during
            2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily attributable to (i) $74.9 million of 2007
            Alaskan Petroleum Production Tax ("PPT") credit dispositions and (ii) a $4.8 million
            2007 royalty obligation accrual adjustment, partially offset by (iii) an $11.3 million
            decrease in interest income, (iv) a $7.6 million reduction in business interruption
            insurance claims and (v) a $7.4 million decrease in derivative ineffectiveness income.
            The $21.9 million increase during 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily attributable
            to (i) a $12.9 million increase in interest income primarily attributable to the
            investing the proceeds from the Argentine and deepwater Gulf of Mexico divestitures
            during 2006, (ii) $7.4 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains recorded during 2006 and
            (iii) $5.6 million of Alaskan exploration incentive credits received in 2006, offset by
            (iv) a $6.6 million decrease in business interruption insurance claims primarily
            attributable to the 2005 Fain plant fire in the West Panhandle field.

In 2006, Alaska replaced its severance tax with the PPT for periods
            beginning after March 31, 2006. In late 2007, Alaska made further changes to the PPT
            through legislation referred to as "Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share" ("ACES"). The
            ACES modifications to PPT were effective as of July 1, 2007. Due to the Company's
            expenditures in Alaska and having no current production, the Company has generated PPT
            related carryforwards. At December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $90 million
            of available PPT related carryforwards that may be monetized in the future. The Company
            anticipates recognizing further benefits from the PPT related carryforwards from (i) a
            reduction in PPT liabilities or (ii) sales of the carryforwards to third parties, if
            transferable, or reimbursement from the State of Alaska. The Company anticipates that
            any transfers of PPT related carryforwards to third parties would be at a discounted
            value, for which the amount of discount is currently not known.

Gain (loss) on disposition of assets.

The Company recorded a net loss on disposition of assets of $2.2 million
            in 2007, as compared to a net loss of $6.5 million in 2006 and a net gain of $60.1
            million during 2005.

In 2005, the gain was primarily related to (i) the sale of the stock of
            a subsidiary that owned the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon, which resulted in a
            $47.5 million gain and (ii) a $14 million property insurance settlement on the
            Company's East Cameron facility that was destroyed by Hurricane Rita, which resulted in
            a $9.7 million gain.

During 2007, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of its Canadian
            assets of $101.3 million. During 2006, the Company recognized gains on the sale of its
            interest in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and its
            Argentina assets of approximately $736.2 million. During 2005, the Company recognized
            gains on the sale of certain assets in Canada and the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico of
            approximately $166.2 million. However, pursuant to SFAS 144, these gains and the
            results of operations from the assets are presented as discontinued
            operations.

The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2007, 2006 and 2005
            were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to fund
            additions to oil and gas properties and stock repurchase programs, and to reduce
            outstanding indebtedness. See Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial
            Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for
            additional information regarding asset divestitures.

Oil and gas production costs.

The
            Company's oil and gas production costs totaled $420.7 million, $349.1 million and
            $309.7 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In general, lease operating
            expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs
            over which the Company has management control, while production taxes and ad valorem
            taxes are directly related to commodity price changes.


Total production costs per BOE increased during 2007 by 12 percent as
            compared to 2006 primarily due to (i) general inflation of field service and supply
            costs associated with rising commodity prices, (ii) increased repair and clean up
            costs, and associated production downtime, from severe weather conditions that affected
            certain areas of the Company's United States operations during the first quarter of
            2007, (iii) increased workover activity and (iv) fixed production costs associated with
            declining South African Sable oil production.

Total production costs per BOE increased during 2006 by 18 percent as
            compared to 2005 primarily due to (i) the impact of a 126 percent increase in delivered
            volumes under VPP agreements, for which the Company bears all associated production
            costs and records no associated sales volumes (representing a per BOE production cost
            impact of approximately $1.50 during 2006 as compared to $.59 during 2005), (ii)
            general inflation of field service and supply costs and (iii) increases in production
            and ad valorem taxes and field utility costs due to increasing commodity and utility
            prices.

The following tables provide the components of the Company's total
            production costs per BOE and total production costs per BOE by geographic area for
            2007, 2006 and 2005:

Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense.

The Company's total DD&A expense was $10.90, $9.52 and $7.76 per BOE
            for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of
            DD&A expense, was $10.10, $8.80 and $7.19 per BOE during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
            respectively. During 2007, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due
            to (i) a generally increasing trend in the Company's oil and gas properties' cost bases
            per BOE of proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in
            drilling rig rates and drilling supplies and (ii) first production of the South Coast
            gas project in South Africa, which has a higher depletion rate.

During 2006, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due
            to (i) a generally increasing trend in the Company's oil and gas properties' cost bases
            per BOE of proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in
            drilling rig rates and drilling supplies, (ii) the sale of proved reserves under VPP
            agreements, for which the Company removed proved reserves with no corresponding
            decrease in cost basis, (iii) a $.50 per BOE increase in Tunisian depletion, primarily
            associated with 2006 and 2005 decreases in the Company's interest in the Adam
            Concession, offset by (iv) a $3.91 per BOE decrease in South Africa depletion,
            primarily associated with 2006 and 2005 positive revisions to proved reserves based on
            well performance.


The following
            table provides depletion expense per BOE from continuing operations by geographic area

Impairment of long-lived assets.

The
            Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas
            properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those
            assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
            recognized aggregate noncash impairment charges of $26.2 million. During 2007, the
            Company recorded a charge of $10.3 million to write off the Company's remaining basis
            in Block H in Equatorial Guinea. The charge was recorded in connection with the ongoing
            arbitration among the parties participating in the Block H prospect. Another $10.2
            million of the impairment charges relate to the Company's announced intent to dispose
            of its Nigerian subsidiary that held the interest in Block 320 and the resulting
            adjustment to reduce its carrying cost basis to Block 320's estimated fair value.
            During the second quarter of 2007, the Company also recognized a $5.7 million
            impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of certain oil and gas properties
            located in Louisiana due to poor well performance.

During 2005, the Company recognized noncash impairment charges of $644
            thousand to reduce the carrying value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets as development
            of the discovery was canceled. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Notes B
            and S of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial
            Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information pertaining to the
            Company's accounting policies regarding assessments of impairment and the Equatorial
            Guinea, Nigeria, Louisiana and Gabonese Olowi field impairments.

During 2007, significant components of the Company's exploratory dry
            hole provisions and leasehold abandonments expense included: (i) $72.1 million of
            suspended well costs written off due to the discontinuation of the Clipper project in
            the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to increasing costs, (ii) $13.8 million of costs
            associated with the Company's unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256 offshore
            Nigeria, (iii) $50.8 million for costs


associated with two unsuccessful exploratory wells in the Company's
            Alaskan NPRA area and the write-off of the remaining prospect costs in the onshore
            North Slope area and (iv) $13.9 million of Tunisian dry hole provisions and abandonment
            costs, which primarily related to the write-off of a suspended well drilled in 2003 on
            the Anaguid permit and an unsuccessful exploratory well in both the Jenein Nord permit
            and the Borj El Khadra permit. During 2007, the Company's seismic activity primarily
            related to its resource plays in South Texas and the Rocky Mountains. During 2007, the
            Company completed and evaluated 76 exploration/extension wells, 60 of which were
            successfully completed as discoveries.

During 2006, significant components of the Company's dry hole provisions
            and leasehold abandonments expense included (i) $34.0 million of costs associated with
            the Company's unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256 prospect offshore Nigeria,
            including $17.8 million of associated unproved leasehold impairment, (ii) $21.6 million
            of dry hole provisions recorded for the Company's unsuccessful Cronus, Storms and
            Antigua prospects in the North Slope area of Alaska, (iii) $16.9 million of dry hole
            provisions and abandonment costs recognized on prospects drilled in prior periods that
            were being evaluated for commerciality, including $7.2 million of costs associated with
            the Company's Boomslang prospect offshore South Africa, $5.5 million of costs
            associated with two discoveries on the Gulf of Mexico shelf in 2005 and $4.2 million of
            costs associated with the Company's Anaguid permit in Tunisia, (iv) $16.0 million of
            dry hole provision and unproved property impairment recognized on the Company's
            unsuccessful Norphlet prospect in Mississippi and (v) a $14.3 million unsuccessful well
            on the Company's Flying Cloud prospect in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2006, the Company
            completed and evaluated 414 exploration/extension wells, 384 of which were successfully
            completed as discoveries.

Significant components of the Company's dry hole expense during 2005
            included (i) $21.2 million related to Alaskan well costs, (ii) $9.5 million associated
            with an unsuccessful Nigerian well, (iii) $3.5 million attributable to an unsuccessful
            suspended well in the Company's El Hamra permit in Tunisia, (iv) $5.1 million
            attributable to an unsuccessful suspended well in the Company's Anaguid permit in
            Tunisia and (v) various other exploratory wells. During 2005, the Company completed and
            evaluated 180 exploratory/extension wells, 149 of which were successfully completed as
            discoveries.

General and administrative expense.

General and administrative expense totaled $129.6 million, $116.6
            million and $110.1 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in
            general and administrative expense during 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due
            to an increase in performance related compensation costs, including the amortization of
            share-based awards to officers, directors and employees. As of December 31, 2007, the
            Company has $34.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested
            share-based awards that will be charged to earnings over a weighted average period of
            approximately one year and five months. The Company continues to monitor its general
            and administrative expense and is focused on administrative cost control. If Pioneer
            Southwest completes its initial public offering, the Company expects that its general
            and administrative expenses would increase.

The increase in general and administrative expense during 2006, as
            compared to 2005, was primarily due to a full year effect of the 2005 staff increases
            associated with the Evergreen acquisition.

Accretion of discount on asset retirement
            obligations.

Accretion of discount on asset retirement
            obligations from continuing operations was $7.0 million, $3.7 million and $3.3 million
            for the years ending during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in
            accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations during 2007 was primarily due to
            new wells placed on production from the 2007 drilling program and the carryover of the
            2006 drilling program. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
            included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional
            information regarding the Company's asset retirement obligations.

Interest expense.

Interest expense
            was $135.3 million, $107.1 million and $126.0 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
            respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Company's indebtedness for the
            year ended December 31, 2007 was 6.5 percent, as compared to 6.7 percent and 6.5
            percent for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, including the
            effects of interest rate derivatives. The increase in interest expense for 2007 as
            compared to 2006 was primarily due to (i) a $44.3 million increase in interest incurred
            on long-term debt due to a $712 million increase in average debt outstanding, primarily
            related to funding additions to oil and gas properties, (ii) a $5.4 million increase in
            noncash interest expense attributable to certain discounted liabilities and deferred
            hedge losses partially offset by (iii) a $20.4 million increase in capitalized interest
            on the Company's Oooguruk and South Coast Gas development projects in Alaska and South
            Africa, respectively. The Company expects interest expense to increase in future
            periods due to the completion of the South Africa South Coast Gas project during the
            third quarter of 2007 and the Alaskan Oooguruk project facilities nearing completion,
            partially offset by declining interest rates on the Company credit facility.


The decrease in interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 was
            primarily due to the repayment of portions of the Company's outstanding borrowings
            under the Company's credit facility with proceeds from the divestiture of the deepwater
            Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets and an $11.1 million increase in interest
            capitalized on the Company's Oooguruk and South Coast Gas development projects,
            partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate hedge
            gains.

See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
            "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about
            the Company's long-term debt and interest expense.

Hurricane activity, net.

The Company
            recorded net hurricane related activity expenses of $61.3 million, $32.0 million and
            $39.8 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, associated with the Company's
            East Cameron platform facility, located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, that was destroyed
            during 2005 by Hurricane Rita.

The Company estimates that it will cost approximately $185 million to
            reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility. The operations to reclaim and abandon
            the East Cameron facilities began in January 2007. The estimate to reclaim and abandon
            the East Cameron facility is based upon an analysis prepared by a third party
            engineering firm for a majority of the work, an estimate by the Company for the
            remaining work that was not covered by the third-party analysis and actual abandonment
            activity to date. The incremental $66.0 million increase in the reclamation and
            abandonment obligation during 2007 is primarily due to increasing the estimated time
            that it will take to complete certain aspects of the reclamation and abandonment
            project based on recent project work experience. During the third quarter of 2007, the
            Company commenced legal actions against its insurance carriers regarding certain policy
            coverage issues. However, the Company continues to expect that a substantial portion of
            the loss will be recoverable by insurance. See Note U of Notes to Consolidated
            Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"
            for additional information about the Company's East Cameron facility reclamation and
            abandonment.

Other expenses.

Other expenses were
            $31.9 million during 2007, as compared to $36.9 million during 2006 and $80.7 million
            during 2005. The $5.1 million decrease in other expense during 2007, as compared to
            2006, is primarily attributable to (i) an $11.2 million decrease in the Company's
            postretirement benefit obligations, (ii) an $8.1 million decrease in losses on early
            extinguishments of debt, (iii) a $6.5 million decrease in non-hedge derivative charges
            and (iv) a $4.0 million decrease in insurance charges, partially offset by (v) a $12.7
            million increase in charges related to commodity hedge ineffectiveness and (vi) an $8.4
            million increase in the cost of idle drilling equipment.

The $43.8 million decrease in other expenses during 2006, as compared to
            2005, is primarily attributable to (i) a $40.4 million decrease in hedge
            ineffectiveness charges and (ii) an $18.4 million decrease in loss on early
            extinguishment of portions of the Company's senior notes, partially offset by (iii) a
            $4.4 million increase in bad debt expense, (iv) a $4.0 million insurance charge, (v) a
            $2.7 million increase in non-hedge derivative charges and (vi) $3.4 million of other
            net increases in other expense components.

Income tax provision.

The Company
            recognized income tax provisions on continuing operations of $112.6 million, $141.0
            million and $149.2 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company's
            effective tax rates for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 32 percent, 48 percent and 45 percent,
            respectively, as compared to the combined United States federal and state statutory
            rates of approximately 37 percent. The effective tax rates of 2007, 2006 and 2005
            differ from the combined United States federal and state statutory rates primarily due
            to:

•

foreign tax rates;

•

statutes in foreign jurisdictions that differ from those
                            in the United States, including a newly-enacted South African tax law
                            allowing for the deduction of 150 percent of development expenditures,
                            resulting in a $15.7 million tax benefit in 2007;

•

an $8.8 million tax benefit in 2007 related to the
                            reversal of Tunisian deferred tax asset valuation allowances previously
                            taken on the Company's Cherouq concession and the recognition of
                            additional tax benefits for costs inherited from the previous owners of
                            the Jenein Nord permit, which management now believes is more likely
                            than not to be realized in the future from forecasted
                            operations;

•

a $40.9 million tax benefit during 2007 related to the
                            Company's exit from Nigeria;

•

a $13.8 million tax benefit during 2007 related to the
                            Company's relinquishment of its remaining rights in Gabon and the write
                            off of costs associated with Block H in Equatorial Guinea;

•

an $18.9 million U.S. tax provision during 2007 related
                            to the Company no longer having identifiable plans to reinvest South
                            Africa earnings in South Africa;


•

recognition of $8.4 million of deferred tax benefit
                            during 2006 as a result of the conversion of senior convertible notes
                            prior to the Company's repayment of the debt principal;

•

recognition of $7.2 million of taxes during 2005
                            associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the
                            American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and

•

expenses for unsuccessful well costs and associated
                            acreage costs in foreign locations where the Company does not expect to
                            receive income tax benefits, principally attributable to unsuccessful
                            wells in Nigeria during 2006 and 2007.

See "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note P of Notes to
            Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
            Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's tax
            position.

Discontinued operations.

During
            2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company sold its interests in the following oil and gas asset
            groups:

The Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $130.7
            million during 2007 as compared to $589.5 million during 2006 and $350.3 million during
            2005. Pursuant to SFAS 144, the results of operations of these assets and the related
            gains on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. See Notes V and W of
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Financial Statements and
            Supplementary Data included herein for additional data on discontinued
            operations.

Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity

Capital commitments.

The Company's
            primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas
            properties, repayment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations.
            Funding for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties and
            repayment of contractual obligations may be provided by any combination of
            internally-generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of nonstrategic assets or
            alternative financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" and "Financing
            activities" below. Generally, funding for the Company's working capital obligations is
            provided by internally-generated cash flows.

Oil and gas properties.

The
            Company's cash expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties during 2007, 2006
            and 2005 totaled $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The
            Company's 2007 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by
            $775.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities, the net proceeds from the
            disposition of Canadian assets and borrowings on the Company's line of credit. The
            Company's 2006 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by
            $754.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities and by a portion of the net
            proceeds from the disposition of deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets. The
            Company's 2005 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were internally
            funded by $1.3 billion of net cash provided by operating activities.

The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at levels which will
            provide sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. The
            Company's capital budget for 2008 is approximately $1.0 billion. The Company currently
            expects that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the capital
            budget.

Off-balance sheet arrangements.

From
            time-to-time, the Company enters into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions
            that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of
            December 31, 2007, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that
            the Company has entered into include (i) undrawn letters of credit, (ii) operating
            lease agreements, (iii) drilling commitments, (iv) VPP obligations (to physically
            deliver volumes and pay related lease operating expenses in the future) and (v)
            contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and
            determinable, such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in
            commodity prices and gas transportation commitments. Other than the off-balance sheet
            arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other
            relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely
            to materially affect the Company's liquidity or


availability of or requirements for capital resources. See "Contractual
            obligations" below for more information regarding the Company's off-balance sheet
            arrangements.

Contractual obligations.

The
            Company's contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling
            commitments (including commitments to pay day rates for drilling rigs), derivative
            obligations, other liabilities, transportation commitments and VPP
            obligations.

The following table summarizes by period the payments due by the Company
            for contractual obligations estimated as of December 31, 2007:

Capital resources.

The Company's
            primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from
            financing activities and proceeds from sales of nonstrategic assets. The Company
            expects that these resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments for the
            foreseeable future. For 2007, the Company's capital commitments exceeded estimated cash
            flows from operations, resulting in additional borrowings under the Company's credit
            facility. For 2008, the Company currently expects that cash flow from operations will
            be sufficient to fund the Company's $1.0 billion capital budget.

Asset divestitures.

In November
            2007, the Company sold all of the common stock of its Canadian subsidiaries for net
            proceeds of $525.7 million. The proceeds from the sale were utilized to reduce amounts
            outstanding under the Company's credit facility. Associated therewith, the Company
            reported a gain of $101.3


million during the fourth quarter of 2007. The results of operations for
            the Canadian assets are included in the Company's discontinued operations.

During March 2006, the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil
            and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $1.2 billion,
            resulting in a gain of $725.3 million. During April 2006, the Company sold its
            Argentine assets for net proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9
            million. The results of operations for these divestitures are included in the Company's
            discontinued operations. The net cash proceeds from these divestitures were used to
            reduce outstanding indebtedness under the Company's credit facility, to fund a portion
            of additions to oil and gas properties, for stock repurchases and for general corporate
            purposes.

During May 2005,
            the Company sold all of its interests in the Martin Creek, Conroy Black and Lookout
            Butte oil and gas properties in Canada for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in
            a gain of $138.3 million. During August 2005, the Company sold all of its interests in
            certain oil and gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net proceeds of $59.2
            million, resulting in a gain of $27.9 million. During October 2005, the Company sold
            all of its shares in a subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon
            for net proceeds of $47.9 million, resulting in a gain of $47.5 million. The net cash
            proceeds from the 2005 divestitures were used to reduce outstanding
            indebtedness.

During 2005, the Company sold 27.8 MMBOE of proved reserves, by means of
            three VPPs for net proceeds of $892.6 million, including the assignment of the
            Company's obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the VPPs
            were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.

See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
            "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information
            regarding the Company's VPPs.

Operating activities.

Net cash
            provided by operating activities during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $775.3 million, $754.8
            million and $1.3 billion, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating
            activities in 2007, as compared to that of 2006, was primarily due to increased sales
            volumes, increased commodity prices and $74.9 million of income realized from the
            disposal of Alaskan PPT credits, offset by the cash provided by operating activities
            associated with the 2006 deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine asset dispositions and
            the 2007 disposal of the Canadian assets. The decrease in net cash provided by
            operating activities in 2006, as compared to that of 2005, was primarily due to the
            loss of cash flow from the aforementioned asset divestitures.

Investing activities.

Net cash used
            in investing activities during 2007 was $1.8 billion, as compared to net cash provided
            by investing activities of $145.5 million and $84.7 million during 2006 and 2005,
            respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities during 2007, as
            compared to 2006, was primarily due to $1.6 billion of net proceeds received from the
            divestiture of assets during 2006, the substantial portion of which resulted from the
            sale of the Company's deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets, and a $663.8
            million increase in additions to oil and gas properties during 2007. The increase in
            net cash provided by investing activities during 2006, as compared to 2005, was
            primarily due to a $396.2 million increase in proceeds from disposition of assets,
            partially offset by a $280.6 million increase in additions to oil and gas properties.
            See "Results of Operations" above and Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial
            Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for
            additional information regarding asset divestitures.

Financing activities.

Net cash
            provided by financing activities for 2007 was $1.0 billion, as compared to net cash
            used in financing activities of $913.5 million and $1.4 billion during 2006 and 2005,
            respectively. During 2007, significant components of financing activities included $1.3
            billion of net borrowings under long-term debt and $221.4 million of net cash used to
            purchase 5.2 million shares of treasury stock. During 2006, significant components of
            financing activities included $554.7 million of net cash used to repay long-term
            borrowings, $348.9 million of net cash used to purchase 8.9 million shares of stock and
            $31.7 million of dividend payments, partially offset by $17.4 million of proceeds from
            the exercise of long-term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases.
            During 2005, financing activities were comprised of $353.6 million of net principal
            repayments on long-term debt, $60.1 million of payments of other noncurrent
            liabilities, primarily comprised of cash settlements of acquired hedge obligations,
            $30.3 million of dividends paid and $949.3 million of stock repurchases, partially
            offset by $41.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of long-term incentive plan stock
            options and employee stock purchases.

During September 2005, the Company announced that the board of directors
            had approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1 billion of
            the Company's common stock. During 2006 and 2005, the Company expended a total of
            $348.9 million to acquire 8.9 million shares of stock and $949.3 million to acquire
            20.0 million shares of stock, respectively, of which $345.3 million and $640.7 million,
            respectively, were


repurchased pursuant to the $1 billion repurchase program. In 2007, the
            Board authorized share repurchases of up to $750 million of the Company's common stock.
            Through December 31, 2007, the Company had repurchased $212.8 million of common stock
            under this 2007 authorized program.

On January 15, 2008, $3.8 million principal amount of the Company's
            6.50% senior notes matured and were repaid with borrowings under its credit facility.
            On August 15, 2007, $32.1 million principal amount of the Company's 8.25% senior notes
            matured and were also repaid with borrowings under the Company's credit
            facility.

During April 2007, the Company amended its existing Amended and Restated
            $1.5 billion 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement with an Amended and Restated 5-Year
            Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility") to extend the maturity and improve
            the pricing. The Credit Facility provides for initial aggregate loan commitments of
            $1.5 billion, which may be increased to a maximum aggregate amount of $2.0 billion if
            the lenders increase their loan commitments or if loan commitments of new financial
            institutions are added. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
            included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional
            information regarding the significant terms of the amended credit facility. During
            January 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts and designated the
            contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest rate risk associated with a
            portion of the Company's Credit Facility indebtedness. The interest rate swap contracts
            are variable-for-fixed-rate swaps on $400 million notional amount of debt at a weighted
            average fixed annual rate of 2.87 percent, excluding any applicable margins. The
            interest rate swaps have an effective start date during February, 2008, $200 million of
            which terminate during February 2010 and $200 million during February 2011.

During March 2007, the Company issued $500 million of 6.65% senior notes
            due 2017 for net proceeds of $494.8 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the
            6.65% senior notes to reduce indebtedness under its credit facility.

During May 2006, the Company issued $450 million of 6.875% senior notes
            due 2018 for net proceeds of $447.4 million. The Company used the net proceeds, in
            part, from the 6.875% senior notes to repurchase $346.2 million of its 6.50% senior
            notes due 2008 and for general corporate purposes.

During 2006, holders of all of the $100 million of 4 3/4% senior
            convertible notes due 2021 exercised their conversion rights. Associated therewith, the
            Company paid $79.9 million in cash, issued 2.3 million shares of common stock and
            recorded a $22.0 million increase to stockholders' equity.

During April 2005, $131.0 million of the Company's 8 7/8% senior notes
            due 2005 matured and were repaid. During 2005, the Company also redeemed the remaining
            $64.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, of aggregate principal amount of its 9
            5/8% senior notes due 2010 and its 7.50% senior notes due 2012. During September 2005,
            the Company accepted tenders to purchase $188.4 million in principal amount of the
            5.875% senior notes due 2012 for $199.9 million. The Company utilized unused borrowing
            capacity under its credit facility to fund these financing activities.

During 2007, the Company's board of directors declared total dividends
            of $.27 per common share. Associated therewith, the Company paid $16.0 million of
            aggregate dividends during April 2007 and $16.8 million of aggregate dividends during
            October 2007. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, and, if declared,
            the Board may change the current dividend amount, including in response to the
            Company's liquidity and capital resources at the time.

In 2007, Pioneer Southwest filed a preliminary registration statement
            (subject to completion) with the SEC to sell limited partner interests. If the offering
            is completed, Pioneer Southwest would own interests in certain oil and gas properties
            currently owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin of West
            Texas. Pioneer Southwest's registration statement contemplates an offering of 35.3
            percent (before underwriters' over-allotment option) of its limited partner interests
            to the public (the "Offering"). The Offering has been postponed due to market
            conditions and timing of the Offering remains uncertain. Completion of the Offering is
            subject to market conditions and numerous other risks beyond the control of Pioneer
            Southwest, and therefore it is possible that the Offering will not be completed, will
            not raise the planned amount of capital even if the Offering is completed, or will not
            be completed when planned.

In October 2007, Pioneer Southwest entered into a $300 million unsecured
            revolving credit facility ("PSE Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks. The PSE
            Credit Agreement would mature five years following the closing of the Offering and
            would contain certain financial covenants that would be applicable to Pioneer
            Southwest. As a result of the most restrictive covenant, borrowings under the PSE
            Credit Agreement would be


expected to be initially limited to approximately $150 million. It is a
            condition to the obligations of the lenders under the PSE Credit Agreement that Pioneer
            Southwest completes the Offering. Pioneer Southwest is seeking an extension of the
            facility from the lenders. There can be no assurance that the lenders will agree to an
            extension, or if they do agree, that the terms of the facility will remain unchanged.
            If Pioneer Southwest were to seek a replacement facility, there can be no assurance
            that it would be able to do so or if it were successful, that the terms would be as
            favorable to Pioneer Southwest as the terms under the PSE Credit Agreement. See Notes F
            and W of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial
            Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information on the Pioneer Southwest
            credit facility and initial public offering.

As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing
            sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred
            stock or common stock. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and
            gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related
            assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect
            to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and
            preferences as determined by the Board.

Liquidity.

The Company's principal
            source of short-term liquidity is cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under its
            credit facility. There were $1.1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the credit
            facility as of December 31, 2007. Including $80 million of undrawn and outstanding
            letters of credit under the credit facility, the Company had $307 million of unused
            borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2007.

In January 2008, the Company issued $500 million of 2.875% senior
            convertible notes ("2.875% Convertible Notes"). The notes will be convertible under
            certain circumstances using a net share settlement process into a combination of cash
            and Pioneer common stock pursuant to a formula. The Company used the net proceeds from
            the 2.875% Convertible Notes to reduce indebtedness under its credit
            facility.

Foreign currency translation.

The
            functional currency of the Company's Canadian subsidiaries was the U.S. dollar ("USD")
            and the Canadian subsidiaries' financial statements were maintained in Canadian dollars
            ("CND"). In accordance with GAAP, the net assets of the Canadian subsidiaries were
            translated into USD-equivalent amounts when they were consolidated into the financial
            statements of the Company and resulting translation gains and losses were deferred as
            items of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the Company's consolidated
            stockholders' equity. As a result of modest fluctuations in the USD to CND exchange
            rates during 2005 and 2006, the Company recorded other comprehensive income (loss) in
            accumulated other comprehensive income – cumulative translation adjustment ("AOCI
            – CTA") in consolidated stockholders equity of $8.1 million and $(6.6) million,
            respectively. However, during 2007 the CND strengthened significantly against the USD,
            associated with which the Company recorded $77.7 million of other comprehensive income
            in AOCI – CTA. During November 2007, the sale of the Company's common stock in
            the Canadian subsidiaries was completed, at which time AOCI – CTA was eliminated
            as a component of the gain on the divestiture of the Canadian assets. See Note V of
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
            and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the divestiture of the
            Canadian subsidiaries.

Debt ratings.

The Company receives
            debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, Inc. ("S&P") and
            Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"), which are subject to regular reviews.
            S&P's rating for the Company is BB+ with a stable outlook. Moodys rating for the
            Company is Ba1 with a negative outlook. S&P and Moodys consider many factors in
            determining the Company's ratings including: production growth opportunities,
            liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in the Company's debt
            ratings could negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or
            the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. As
            of December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt
            covenants.

Book capitalization and current ratio.

The Company's book capitalization at December 31, 2007 was $5.8 billion,
            consisting of debt of $2.8 billion and stockholders' equity of $3.0 billion. The
            Company's debt to book capitalization increased to 48 percent at December 31, 2007 from
            33 percent at December 31, 2006, primarily due to increased indebtedness which was used
            to fund the Company's additions to oil and gas properties and stock repurchases. The
            Company's debt to book capitalization at December 31, 2005 was 48 percent and decreased
            to 33 percent at December 31, 2006. The decrease was principally due to the reduction
            of debt from the application of the proceeds received from the divestiture of the
            deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets and Argentine assets in 2006. The Company's ratio of
            current assets to current liabilities was .77 to 1.00 at December 31, 2007, as compared
            to .60 to 1.00 at December 31, 2006.


Critical Accounting Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion
            in this Report in accordance with GAAP. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial
            Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a
            comprehensive discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies. GAAP
            represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the
            application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain
            circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. Following is a discussion
            of the Company's most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that
            are inherent in the Company's application of GAAP.

Asset retirement obligations.

The
            Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to
            restore the land or seabeds at the end of oil and gas production operations. The
            Company's removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging
            and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms.
            Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires
            management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are
            many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of
            what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing,
            as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations
            considerations.

Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and
            judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted
            discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory,
            environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these
            assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations, a
            corresponding adjustment is generally made to the oil and gas property balance. See
            Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8.
            Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the
            Company's asset retirement obligations.

Successful efforts method of accounting.

The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil
            and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method.
            In general, the Company believes that, during periods of active exploration, net assets
            and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of
            accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method. The
            critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full
            cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method, exploratory dry holes
            and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during
            the periods in which they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting,
            such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful
            wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion
            expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment,
            geological and geophysical expense from (i) continuing operations of $279.3 million,
            $250.2 million and $153.8 million, respectively, and (ii) discontinued operations of
            $14.4 million, $21.3 million and $73.4 million, respectively, under the successful
            efforts method.

Proved reserve estimates.

Estimates
            of the Company's proved reserves included in this Report are prepared in accordance
            with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function
            of:

•

the quality and quantity of available data;

•

the interpretation of that data;

•

the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions;
                            and

•

the judgment of the persons preparing the
                            estimate.

The Company's proved reserve information included in this Report as of
            December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were prepared by the Company's engineers and audited
            by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Company's major properties.
            Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included
            herein.

Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may
            substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different
            from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results
            of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify,
            positively or negatively, material revisions to the estimate of proved
            reserves.

It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this
            Report as of December 31, 2007 is the current market value of the Company's estimated
            proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the
            Standardized Measure on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future
            prices and


costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of
            the date of the estimate. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information
            regarding estimates of proved reserves.

The Company's estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion
            expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the Company
            records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may
            result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and
            produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may
            impact the outcome of the Company's assessment of its proved properties and goodwill
            for impairment.

Impairment of proved oil and gas properties.

The Company reviews its proved properties to be held and used whenever
            management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying
            value of the properties may not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an
            impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and
            net cash flows that may be generated by the properties and if a significant downward
            revision has occurred to the estimated proved reserves. Proved oil and gas properties
            are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is
            calculated.

Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties.

At December 31, 2007, the Company carried unproved property costs of
            $277.5 million. Management periodically assesses unproved oil and gas properties for
            impairment, on a project-by-project basis. Management's assessment of the results of
            exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of
            all or a portion of such projects impacts the amount and timing of impairment
            provisions, if any.

Suspended wells.

The Company
            suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final
            determination of the commercial potential of the oil and gas discovery. The ultimate
            disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity
            and development decisions. If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal
            activities or development of these fields, the costs of these wells will be charged to
            exploration and abandonment expense.

The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an
            exploratory well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets for more than one year
            following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas
            reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the following
            conditions are met:

(i)

The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
                            justify its completion as a producing well.

(ii)

The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the
                            reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
                            project.

Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of
            certain projects, it may take the Company longer than one year to evaluate the future
            potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination
            on its commercial viability. In these instances, the project's feasibility is not
            contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Company's
            ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon
            recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies'
            production, transportation or processing facilities and/or getting partner approval to
            drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued
            constantly. Consequently, the Company's assessment of suspended exploratory well costs
            is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or
            is noncommercial and is impaired. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial
            Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for
            additional information regarding the Company's suspended exploratory well
            costs.

Assessments of functional currencies.

Management determines the functional currencies of the Company's
            subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in
            which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues, costs and
            expenses. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of all of the Company's current
            international operations. The assessment of functional currencies can have a
            significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position.

Deferred tax asset valuation allowances.

The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to
            determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be
            realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company-specific, oil and gas
            industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the
            Company's net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each
            jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurance that
            facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to establish
            deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period. As
            of December 31, 2007, the Company does not believe there is sufficient positive
            evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to certain foreign tax
            jurisdictions.


Goodwill impairment.

The Company
            reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually. This requires the Company to
            estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have
            goodwill. There is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values,
            particularly in the estimation of proved reserves as described above. See Note B of
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
            and Supplementary Data" for additional information.

Litigation and environmental contingencies.

The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
            ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can vary from such
            estimates for a variety of reasons. The costs to settle litigation can vary from
            estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on
            the amount of damages. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to
            change because of changes in laws and regulations, developing information relating to
            the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Under GAAP,
            a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines the
            loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated
            Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"
            for additional information regarding the Company's commitments and
            contingencies.

Valuations of defined benefit pension and postretirement
            plans.

The Company is the sponsor of certain defined
            benefit pension and postretirement plans. In accordance with GAAP, the Company is
            required to estimate the present value of its unfunded pension and accumulated
            postretirement benefit obligations. Based on those values, the Company records the
            unfunded obligations of those plans and records ongoing service costs and associated
            interest expense. The valuation of the Company's pension and accumulated postretirement
            benefit obligations requires management assumptions and judgments as to benefit cost
            inflation factors, mortality rates and discount factors. Changes in these factors may
            materially change future benefit costs and pension and accumulated postretirement
            benefit obligations. See "New Accounting Pronouncements" below and Note H of Notes to
            Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Consolidated Financial
            Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's
            pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.

Valuation of stock-based compensation.

The Company adopted the "modified prospective" approach as prescribed
            under SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. Under this approach, the Company is
            required to expense all options and other stock-based compensation that vested during
            the year of adoption based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. The
            calculation of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires the use of estimates
            to derive the inputs necessary for using the various valuation methods utilized by the
            Company. The Company utilizes (a) the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the
            fair value of stock options, (b) the stock price on the date of grant for the fair
            value of restricted stock awards and (c) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair
            value of performance unit awards.

New Accounting Pronouncements

The following discussions provide information about new accounting
            pronouncements that were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
            during 2007:

SFAS 157.

In September 2006, the
            FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair
            value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about
            fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change
            existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157
            is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The implementation of
            SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on the financial condition or results of
            operations of the Company.

SFAS 159.

In February 2007, the FASB
            issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
            Liabilities" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to measure many financial
            instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be
            measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for
            fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
            years. The implementation of SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material effect on the
            financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

SFAS 141(R).

In December 2007, the
            FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"). SFAS 141(R) replaces
            SFAS 141 and provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of
            business combinations. SFAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business
            combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction
            and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at
            the fair value as of that date. This includes the measurement of the acquirer shares
            issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent
            consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
            recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the


accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the
            treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the recognition of changes in
            the acquirer's income tax valuation allowance and deferred taxes. SFAS 141(R) is
            effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on
            or after December 15, 2008, and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of
            the fiscal year in which the statement is applied. The implementation of SFAS 141(R) is
            not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of
            operations of the Company.

SFAS

160.

In December 2007, the FASB
            issued SFAS No. 160 "Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an
            amendment of ARB Statement No. 51" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 160 amends Accounting
            Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to establish
            accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and
            for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling
            interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an
            ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of
            equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements,
            SFAS 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include
            the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also
            requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts
            of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling
            interest. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 and is not
            expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.


ITEM
            7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
            RISK

The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about
            financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2007 and
            2006, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from changes in
            market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Although certain
            derivative contracts to which the Company has been a party did not qualify as hedges,
            the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading
            purposes.

The fair value of the Company's derivative contracts is determined based
            on counterparties' estimates and valuation models. The Company did not change its
            valuation method during 2007. During 2007, the Company was a party to commodity,
            interest rate and foreign exchange rate swap contracts and commodity collar contracts.
            See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial
            Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's
            derivative contracts, including deferred gains and losses on terminated derivative
            contracts. The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values
            of the Company's open derivative contracts during 2007:

Represents the fair values of open derivative contracts

                            million of obligations under terminated derivatives as of December 31,
                            2007 and 2006, respectively, for which no market risk
                            exists.

(b)

At inception, new derivative contracts entered into by
                            the Company have no intrinsic value.

Quantitative Disclosures

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity.

Prior to its sale, the Company's Canadian subsidiary entered into
            short-term forward currency agreements to purchase Canadian dollars with U.S. dollar
            gas sales proceeds. The Company did not designate these derivatives as hedges due to
            their short-term nature.

During November 2007, the Company invested $131.7 million Canadian
            dollars ("CND") in a CND-denominated escrow account associated with the sale of the
            Company's Canadian assets (see Notes V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
            included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional
            information regarding the sale of the Company's Canadian assets). During December 2007,
            the Company entered into foreign exchange rate derivatives to swap $131.7 million CND
            for $131.0 million U.S. dollars ("USD") to be delivered during May 2008. As of December
            31, 2007, the fair value of the foreign exchange rate swap contracts was a liability of
            $1.5 million. The foreign exchange rate swaps were economic hedges of the
            CND-denominated escrow account balance; however, uncertainty regarding the matching of
            cash flow timing between the foreign exchange rate swaps and the liquidation of the
            CND-denominated escrow account caused the Company not to designate the foreign exchange
            rate swaps as hedges. The CND-denominated escrow account was liquidated during January
            2008 for $129.0 million USD, at which time the foreign exchange rate swaps were
            terminated at a gain of $1.8 million. Subsequent to these transactions, the Company has
            no remaining material foreign exchange rate risk associated with financial
            instruments.

Interest rate sensitivity.

The
            following tables provide information about other financial instruments to which the
            Company was a party as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 that were sensitive to changes in
            interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present maturities by expected
            maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt
            given current contractual terms and market conditions and the debt's estimated
            fair


value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate
            represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically
            pay on the debt as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. For variable rate debt, the average
            interest rate represents the average rates being paid on the debt projected forward
            proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on February 8, 2008. As of December
            31, 2007, the Company was not a party to material derivatives that would subject it to
            interest rate sensitivity.

                            indebtedness at a fixed weighted average annual interest rate of 2.87
                            percent, excluding any applicable margins. The interest rate swaps
                            mature during February 2010 ($200 million notional amount) and 2011

Commodity price sensitivity.

The
            following tables provide information about the Company's oil and gas derivative
            financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil, NGL and gas prices as of
            December 31, 2007 and 2006. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, substantially all of the
            Company's oil, NGL and gas derivative financial instruments qualified as
            hedges.


Commodity hedge instruments.

The
            Company hedges commodity price risk with derivative contracts, such as swap and collar
            contracts. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes.
            Collar contracts provide minimum ("floor") and maximum ("ceiling") prices for the
            Company on a notional amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price
            participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price.

See Notes B, E and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
            included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of
            the accounting procedures followed by the Company relative to hedge derivative
            financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of the Company's
            derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil, NGL or gas

To minimize basis risk, the Company enters into basis

                            geographic area of production. The Company considers these basis swaps
                            as part of the associated swap and collar contracts and, accordingly,
                            the effects of the basis swaps have been presented together with the
                            associated contracts.

Qualitative Disclosures

Non-derivative financial instruments.

The Company is a borrower under fixed rate and variable rate debt
            instruments that give rise to interest rate risk. The Company's objective in borrowing
            under fixed or variable rate debt is to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing
            the Company's costs of capital. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial
            Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a
            discussion of the Company's debt instruments.

Derivative financial instruments.

The Company utilizes interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity
            price derivative contracts to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity
            price risks in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Board. In
            accordance with those policies and guidelines, the Company's executive management
            determines the appropriate timing and extent of hedge transactions.

Foreign currency, operations and price risk.

International investments represent, and are expected to continue to
            represent, a portion of the Company's total assets. Pioneer currently has international
            operations in Tunisia and South Africa, which together represented 11 percent of the
            Company's 2007 oil and gas revenues from continuing operations. Although Pioneer's
            primary focus is directed toward onshore North American opportunities, Pioneer
            continues to identify and selectively evaluate other international opportunities. As a
            result of such foreign operations, Pioneer's financial results and international
            operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange
            rates, changes in the legal or regulatory environment, weak economic conditions or
            changes in political or economic climates and other factors. For example:

•

local political and economic developments could restrict
                            or increase the cost of Pioneer's foreign operations;

•

exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result
                            in financial losses;

•

royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims
                            could increase costs of Pioneer's foreign operations;

•

expropriation of the Company's property could result in
                            loss of revenue, property and equipment;

•

civil uprising, riots, terrorist attacks and wars could
                            make it impractical to continue operations, resulting in financial
                            losses;

•

compliance with applicable U.S. law could be in conflict
                            with the Company's contractual obligations, the laws of foreign
                            governments or local customs;

•

import and export regulations and other foreign laws or
                            policies could result in loss of revenues;


•

repatriation  levels for export revenues
                            could restrict the availability of cash to fund operations

outside a particular foreign country; and

•

laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade,
                            taxation and investment could restrict Pioneer's ability to fund
                            foreign operations or may make foreign operations more
                            costly.

Pioneer does not currently maintain political risk insurance. Pioneer
            evaluates on a country-by-country basis whether obtaining political risk coverage is
            necessary and may add such insurance in the future if the Company believes it is
            prudent to do so.

Africa

. The Company's producing
            assets in Africa are in South Africa and Tunisia. The Company views the operating
            environment in these African nations as stable and the economic stability as good. The
            Company also has an exploration permit in Equatorial Guinea. While the values of the
            various African nations' currencies fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the
            Company believes that any currency risk associated with Pioneer's African operations
            would not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations given that such
            operations are closely tied to oil prices, which are denominated in U.S.
            dollars.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
            Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Pioneer
            Natural Resources Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pioneer
            Natural Resources Company (the "Company") as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
            related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and
            comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007.
            These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
            responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
            audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
            Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
            plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
            statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
            basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
            audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
            made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
            We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
            present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
            Pioneer Natural Resources Company at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated
            results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
            ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
            principles.

As discussed in Note P to the consolidated financial statements, the
            Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
            – an interpretation of FASB No. 109," effective January 1, 2007. As discussed in
            Note B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of
            Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," effective January 1,
            2006. As discussed in Note H to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
            adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for
            Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," effective December 31,
            2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
            Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over
            financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
            Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
            Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2008
            expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTE A.

Organization and Nature of Operations

Pioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer" or the "Company") is a
            Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock
            Exchange. The Company is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production
            company with continuing operations in the United States, South Africa and
            Tunisia.

NOTE B.

Summary of Significant Accounting
                            Policies

Principles of consolidation.

The
            consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
            wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries since their acquisition or formation.
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46
            (revised December 2003) "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN46(R)")
            requires that the Company's consolidated financial statements also include the accounts
            of variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which Pioneer holds a variable interest that
            will absorb a majority of the entities' expected losses, receive a majority of the
            entities' expected residual returns, or both. In accordance therewith, the accompanying
            consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PNR Holdings LLC as of and
            for the year ended December 31, 2007 (see Oil and gas properties, below for additional
            information regarding PNR Holdings LLC). The Company proportionately consolidates less
            than 100 percent-owned affiliate partnerships, for which certain of its wholly-owned
            subsidiaries serve as general partners, involved in oil and gas producing activities in
            accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Abstract Issue No. 00-1, "Investor
            Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in
            Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures". The Company owns less than a 31 percent
            interest in the oil and gas partnerships that it proportionately consolidates. All
            material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries.

The Company owns the majority interests in certain subsidiaries with
            operations in the United States and owned the majority interest in a subsidiary with
            operations in Nigeria, that was disposed of in 2007. Associated therewith, the Company
            has recognized minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries of $11.9 million and
            $14.4 million in other liabilities and minority interests in the accompanying
            Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Minority interests in the net losses of the Company's consolidated
            Nigerian subsidiary totaled $2.8 million, $4.9 million and $5.2 million for the years
            ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included in interest and
            other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Minority
            interests in the net income of the Company's consolidated United States subsidiaries
            totaled $2.4 million, $2.6 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31,
            2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included in other expense in the
            accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Discontinued operations.

During
            2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company sold its interests in the following oil and gas asset
            groups:

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
            No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"),
            the Company has reflected the results of operations of the above divestitures as
            discontinued operations, rather than as a component of continuing operations. See Note
            V for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Use of estimates in the preparation of financial
            statements.

Preparation of the accompanying consolidated
            financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
            United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
            reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
            liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
            of


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Depletion of oil and
            gas properties and impairment of goodwill and oil and gas properties, in part, is
            determined using estimates of proved oil and gas reserves. There are numerous
            uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the
            projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures.
            Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties are
            subject to numerous uncertainties including, among others, estimates of future
            recoverable reserves; commodity price outlooks; foreign laws, restrictions and currency
            exchange rates; and export and excise taxes. Actual results could differ from the
            estimates and assumptions utilized.

Cash
            equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on
            hand and depository accounts held by banks.

Investments.

Investments in unaffiliated equity
            securities that have a readily determinable fair value are classified as "trading
            securities" if management's current intent is to hold them for the near term;
            otherwise, they are accounted for as "available-for-sale" securities. The Company
            reevaluates the classification of investments in unaffiliated equity securities at each
            balance sheet date. The carrying value of trading securities and available-for-sale
            securities are adjusted to fair value as of each balance sheet date.

Unrealized holding gains are recognized for trading securities in
            interest and other income, and unrealized holding losses are recognized in other
            expense during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.

Unrealized holding gains and losses are recognized for
            available-for-sale securities as credits or charges to stockholders' equity and other
            comprehensive income (loss) during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.
            Realized gains and losses on the divestiture of available-for-sale securities are
            determined using the average cost method. The Company had no investments in
            available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2007 or 2006.

Investments in unaffiliated equity securities that do not have a readily
            determinable fair value are measured at the lower of their original cost or the net
            realizable value of the investment. The Company had no significant equity security
            investments that did not have a readily determinable fair value as of December 31, 2007
            or 2006.

Inventories.

Inventories were
            comprised of $94.3 million and $93.7 million of materials and supplies and $3.3 million
            and $1.4 million of commodities as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
            Company's materials and supplies inventory is primarily comprised of oil and gas
            drilling or repair items such as tubing, casing, chemicals, operating supplies and
            ordinary maintenance materials and parts. The materials and supplies inventory is
            primarily acquired for use in future drilling operations or repair operations and is
            carried at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in, first-out cost basis.
            Commodities inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or market, on a first-in,
            first-out basis. Any impairments of inventory are reflected in gain (loss) on
            disposition of assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31,
            2007 and 2006, the Company's materials and supplies inventory was net of $1.1 million
            and $4.2 million, respectively, of valuation reserve allowances.

Oil and gas properties.

The Company
            utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties.
            Under this method, all costs associated with productive wells and nonproductive
            development wells are capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological
            and geophysical expenditures are expensed. The Company capitalizes interest on
            expenditures for significant development projects, generally when the underlying
            project is sanctioned, until such projects are ready for their intended use.

The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an
            exploratory well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets for more than one year
            following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas
            reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the following
            conditions are met:

(i)

The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
                            justify its completion as a producing well.

(ii)

The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the
                            reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
                            project.

Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of
            certain projects, it may take the Company longer than one year to evaluate the future
            potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination
            on its commercial viability. In these instances, the project's feasibility is not
            contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Company's
            ongoing efforts and expenditures related to


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well
            information, gaining access to other companies' production, transportation or
            processing facilities and/or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal
            wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly. Consequently, the
            Company's assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision
            can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is charged
            to exploration and abandonments expense. See Note D for additional information
            regarding the Company's suspended exploratory well costs.

The Company owns interests in four natural gas processing plants and ten
            treating facilities. The Company operates two of the gas processing plants and all ten
            treating facilities. The Company's ownership interests in the natural gas processing
            plants and treating facilities is primarily to accommodate handling the Company's gas
            production and thus are considered a component of the capital and operating costs of
            the respective fields that they service. To the extent that there is excess capacity at
            a plant or treating facility, the Company attempts to process third party gas volumes
            for a fee to keep the plant or treating facility at capacity. All revenues and expenses
            derived from third party gas volumes processed through the plants and treating
            facilities are reported as components of oil and gas production costs. Third party
            revenues from continuing operations generated from the plant and treating facilities
            for the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $40.0 million, $37.8
            million and $38.0 million, respectively. Third party expenses from continuing
            operations attributable to the plants and treating facilities for the same respective
            periods were $12.1 million, $8.4 million and $7.8 million. The capitalized costs of the
            plants and treating facilities are included in proved oil and gas properties and are
            depleted using the unit-of-production method along with the other capitalized costs of
            the field that they service.

Capitalized costs relating to proved properties are depleted using the
            unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. Costs of significant nonproducing
            properties, wells in the process of being drilled and development projects are excluded
            from depletion until such time as the related project is completed and proved reserves
            are established or, if unsuccessful, impairment is determined.

Proceeds from the sales of individual properties and the capitalized
            costs of individual properties sold or abandoned are credited and charged,
            respectively, to accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization. Generally, no
            gain or loss is recognized until the entire amortization base is sold. However, gain or
            loss is recognized from the sale of less than an entire amortization base if the
            disposition is significant enough to materially impact the depletion rate of the
            remaining properties in the depletion base.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company reviews its long-lived
            assets to be held and used, including proved oil and gas properties accounted for under
            the successful efforts method of accounting, whenever events or circumstances indicate
            that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
            indicated if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount
            of the assets. In this circumstance, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the
            amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of
            the asset.

Unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment
            on a project-by-project basis. The impairment assessment is affected by the results of
            exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of
            all or a portion of such projects. If the quantity of potential reserves determined by
            such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project,
            the Company will recognize an impairment loss at that time.

During December 2007, PNR Holdings LLC completed acquisitions of proved
            and unproved oil and gas properties located in the United States Raton Basin and
            Barnett Shale play for $352.2 million for the purpose of conducting oil and gas
            producing activities. The Company caused PNR Holdings LLC to be formed pursuant to an
            agreement with a third party in anticipation of having the acquisitions treated as part
            of a tax-deferred, like-kind-exchange with the anticipated sale of oil and gas
            properties to Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. ("Pioneer Southwest"), a
            subsidiary of the Company. See Note W for additional information on the Pioneer
            Southwest initial public offering. The Company controls PNR Holdings LLC pursuant to a
            management agreement (the "Management Agreement") whereby Pioneer Natural Resources
            USA, Inc. ("PNR USA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provides operating and
            administrative management of all of PNR Holdings LLC's properties. PNR Holdings LLC
            financed the acquisitions with borrowings under a credit agreement ("Holdings Credit
            Agreement") entered into with PNR USA. Under the terms of the Holdings Credit Agreement
            and


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

Management Agreement, PNR Holdings LLC is a VIE in which PNR USA will
            receive substantially all of the entity's expected residual returns and absorb
            substantially all of the entity's expected losses. PNR USA's loans under the Holdings
            Credit Agreement are secured by the property interests acquired by PNR Holdings LLC.
            General creditors of PNR Holdings LLC may lack recourse as a result of PNR USA's
            secured debtor standing. As of December 31, 2007, PNR Holdings LLC's proved oil and gas
            properties having a net carrying value of $260.3 million and unproved oil and gas
            properties with a carrying value of $91.5 million are included in the Consolidated
            Balance Sheet of the Company. Outstanding PNR Holdings LLC borrowings of $351.8 million
            under the Holdings Credit Agreement have been eliminated in consolidation against the
            associated loans from PNR USA.

Goodwill.

During 2004, the Company
            recorded $327.8 million of goodwill associated with a business combination. The
            goodwill was recorded to the Company's United States reporting unit. In accordance with
            EITF Abstract Issue No. 00-23, "Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation
            under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44", the Company has reduced
            goodwill by $16.9 million since September 28, 2004 for tax benefits associated with the
            exercise of fully-vested stock options assumed in conjunction with the Evergreen
            merger. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets",
            goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but is assessed for impairment whenever events
            or circumstances indicate that impairment of the carrying value of goodwill is likely,
            but no less often than annually. If the carrying value of goodwill is determined to be
            impaired, it is reduced for the impaired value with a corresponding charge to pretax
            earnings in the period in which it is determined to be impaired. During the third
            quarter of 2007, the Company performed its annual assessment of impairment of the
            goodwill and determined that there was no impairment.

Other property, plant and equipment, net.

Other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and primarily
            consists of items such as heavy equipment and rigs, furniture and fixtures and
            leasehold improvements. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of the
            assets using the straight-line method. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, other property,
            plant and equipment was net of accumulated depreciation of $166.6 million and $145.3
            million, respectively.

Asset retirement obligations.

The
            Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 143,
            "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 requires that the
            fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the
            period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
            Under the provisions of SFAS 143, asset retirement obligations are generally
            capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset. Conditional asset
            retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and are recognized when
            incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated.

Asset retirement obligation expenditures are classified as cash used in
            operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash
            Flows.

Derivatives and hedging.

The Company
            follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
            Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 requires the accounting recognition of all
            derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivative
            instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net income.
            Under the provisions of SFAS 133, the Company may designate a derivative instrument as
            hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an
            identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk (a "fair value
            hedge") or as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that
            are attributable to a particular risk (a "cash flow hedge"). Both at the inception of a
            hedge and on an ongoing basis, a fair value hedge must be expected to be highly
            effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk
            during the periods that a hedge is designated. Similarly, a cash flow hedge must be
            expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the
            hedged risk during the term of the hedge. The expectation of hedge effectiveness must
            be supported by matching the essential terms of the hedged asset, liability or
            forecasted transaction to the derivative hedge contract or by effectiveness assessments
            using statistical measurements. The Company's policy is to assess hedge effectiveness
            at the end of each calendar quarter.

Under the provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of
            derivative instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in the
            fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through net income.
            Effective changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges
            are recognized in

            Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets until such time as the hedged items are
            recognized in net income. Ineffective portions of a derivative instrument's change in
            fair value are immediately recognized in earnings.

See Note J for a description of the specific types of derivative transactions in which
            the Company participates.

Environmental.

The Company's environmental expenditures
            are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures
            that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future
            economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend the life of the related
            property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized.
            Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessment and/or remediation is probable
            and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are undiscounted unless the
            timing of cash payments for the liability is fixed or reliably determinable.

Treasury stock.

Treasury stock
            purchases are recorded at cost. Upon reissuance, the cost of treasury shares held is
            reduced by the average purchase price per share of the aggregate treasury shares held.
            During 2006, the Company retired 22.9 million treasury shares, resulting in a reduction
            in treasury stock of $1.0 billion.

Revenue recognition.

The Company
            does not recognize revenues until they are realized or realizable and earned. Revenues
            are considered realized or realizable and earned when: (i) persuasive evidence of an
            arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii)
            the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectibility is
            reasonably assured.

The Company uses the entitlements method of accounting for oil, natural
            gas liquid ("NGL") and gas revenues. Sales proceeds in excess of the Company's
            entitlement are included in other liabilities and the Company's share of sales taken by
            others is included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
            Sheets.

The Company had no material oil entitlement assets, NGL entitlement
            assets or NGL entitlement liabilities as of December 31, 2007 or 2006. The following
            table presents the Company's oil entitlement liabilities and gas entitlement assets and
            liabilities with their associated volumes as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:

Stock-based compensation.

On January
            1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS
            123(R)") to account for stock-based compensation. Among other items, SFAS 123(R)
            eliminates the use of the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
            Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"), intrinsic value method of accounting and
            requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for
            awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in the
            financial statements. The Company elected to use the modified prospective method for
            adoption of SFAS 123(R), which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all
            unvested stock options and other equity-based compensation beginning in the first
            quarter of adoption. For all unvested stock options outstanding as of January 1, 2006,
            the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based on the fair value
            on the date of grant, was recognized in the Company's financial statements over their
            remaining vesting periods, which ended in August 2006. For equity-based compensation
            awards granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2006, compensation expense, based
            on the fair value on the date of grant, is being recognized in the Company's financial
            statements over the vesting period. The Company utilizes (a) the Black-Scholes option
            pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, (b) the stock price on the
            date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards

and (c) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of
            performance unit awards. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company followed the
            intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 to account for stock options. Prior
            period financial statements have not been restated. The modified prospective method
            requires the Company to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to
            stock-based compensation as opposed to its prior policy of recognizing forfeitures as
            they occurred. The Company recorded no cumulative effect as a result of adopting SFAS
            123(R).

Additionally, under the provisions of SFAS 123(R), deferred compensation
            recorded under APB 25 related to equity-based awards should be eliminated against the
            appropriate equity accounts. As a result, upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company
            eliminated $45.8 million of deferred compensation cost in stockholders' equity and
            reduced a like amount of additional paid-in capital in the accompanying Consolidated
            Balance Sheets.

For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded
            $35.3 million and $32.1 million of compensation costs for all stock-based plans,
            respectively, including compensation costs of $606 thousand and $669 thousand,
            respectively, associated with the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"),
            which is a compensatory plan under the provisions of SFAS 123(R). The impact to the
            Company's net income of the year ended December 31, 2006 of adopting SFAS 123(R) was
            $1.6 million, or less than $.02 per diluted share, including the $669 thousand of ESPP
            compensation expense recorded in that year.

Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS 123(R), the Company's issued shares,
            as reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated
            Statements of Stockholders' Equity at December 31, 2007 and 2006, do not include
            1,960,475 shares and 1,946,211 shares, respectively, related to unvested restricted
            stock awards.

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and
            net income per share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
            provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) to stock-based compensation during the year ended
            December 31, 2005:

Foreign currency translation.

The
            U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the Company's current international
            operations. Accordingly, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign
            currency are remeasured to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of
            each reporting period; revenues and costs and expenses denominated in a foreign
            currency are remeasured at the average of the exchange rates that were in effect during
            the period in which the revenues and costs and expenses were recognized. The resulting
            gains or losses from


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

remeasuring foreign currency denominated balances into U.S. dollars are
            recorded in other income or other expense, respectively. Nonmonetary assets and
            liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured at the historic exchange
            rates that were in effect when the assets or liabilities were acquired or
            incurred.

Prior to the sale, the functional currency of the Company's Canadian
            operations was the Canadian dollar. The financial statements of the Company's Canadian
            subsidiaries were translated to U.S. dollars as follows: all assets and liabilities
            were translated using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period;
            revenues and costs and expenses were translated using the average of the exchange rates
            that were in effect during the period in which the revenues and costs and expenses were
            recognized. The resulting gains or losses from translating non-U.S. dollar denominated
            balances were recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders'
            Equity for the period through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) -
            cumulative translation adjustment ("AOCI-CTA").

During November 2007, the Company completed the divestiture of its
            Canadian subsidiaries. As such, the net cumulative translation adjustment previously
            deferred in AOCI-CTA was recognized as part of the gain on sale of the Canadian
            subsidiaries and, at December 31, 2007, the Company did not translate a Canadian
            balance sheet into U.S dollars.

The following table presents the exchange rates used to translate the
            financial statements of the Company's Canadian subsidiaries in the preparation of the
            consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and for the years

New accounting pronouncements.

The
            following discussions provide information about new accounting pronouncements that were
            issued by FASB during 2007:

SFAS 157.

In September 2006, the
            FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair
            value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about
            fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change
            existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157
            is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The implementation of
            SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on the financial condition or results of
            operations of the Company.

SFAS 159.

In February 2007, the FASB
            issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
            Liabilities" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to measure many financial
            instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be
            measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for
            fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
            years. The implementation of SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material effect on the
            financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

SFAS 141(R).

In December 2007, the
            FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"). SFAS 141(R) replaces
            SFAS 141 and provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of
            business combinations. SFAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business
            combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction
            and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at
            the fair value as of that date. This includes the measurement of the acquirer shares
            issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent
            consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
            recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for
            acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of acquisition related
            transaction costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer's income tax valuation
            allowance and deferred taxes. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years and interim
            periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and is to
            be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement
            is applied. The


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

implementation of SFAS 141(R) is not expected to have a material effect
            on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

SFAS

160.

In December 2007, the FASB
            issued SFAS No. 160 "Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an
            amendment of ARB Statement No. 51" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 160 amends Accounting
            Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to establish
            accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and
            for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling
            interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an
            ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of
            equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements,
            SFAS 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include
            the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also
            requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts
            of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling
            interest. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 and is not
            expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

NOTE C.

Proved Property Acquisitions

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
            expended approximately $331.6 million, $78.3 million and $173.4 million, respectively,
            to acquire working interests in proved oil and gas properties. During 2007, the
            Company's proved oil and gas property acquisitions primarily comprised property
            interests in the Permian Basin, the Raton Basin, the Barnett Shale play and onshore
            Gulf Coast. During 2006, the Company's proved oil and gas property acquisitions
            primarily comprised property interests in the Permian Basin, onshore Gulf Coast and
            Alaska. During 2005, the Company's proved oil and gas property acquisitions primarily
            comprised property interests in the Permian Basin and onshore Gulf Coast.

NOTE D.

Exploratory Well Costs

The Company capitalizes exploratory well costs until a determination is
            made that the well has either found proved reserves or that it is impaired. The
            capitalized exploratory well costs are presented in proved properties in the
            Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the exploratory well is determined to be impaired, the
            well costs are charged to expense.

The following table reflects the Company's capitalized exploratory well
            activity during each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

The following discussion describes the history and status of each
            significant suspended exploratory project as of December 31, 2007:

Lay Creek.

The Company's Lay Creek project is a coal bed
            methane pilot program located in northwestern

Colorado. The Company has drilled 18 wells in six separate pilot areas
            and completed workovers and recompletions on 14 wells drilled by a previous operator.
            The Company completed the water treatment facilities and initiated sales of production
            in 2007. Determination of success of the pilot project is dependent on the ability to
            dewater the formation and determine if commercial quantities of gas can be produced.
            The pilot project is currently in the dewatering phase and a determination of
            commerciality should be known by the end of 2008.

The carrying amounts
            approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

swap contracts.

The fair value of commodity price swap and collar contracts, interest
            rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are estimated from quotes provided by the
            counterparties to these derivative contracts and represent the estimated amounts that
            the Company would expect to receive or pay to settle the derivative contracts. See Note
            J for a description of each of these types of derivatives, including whether the
            derivative contract qualifies for hedge accounting treatment or is considered a
            speculative derivative contract.

Financial assets.

The carrying
            amounts of the trading securities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of
            these instruments. The fair value of the notes receivable approximates the carrying
            value at December 31, 2007 due to the adequacy of collateral security and interest
            yields. The current portion of the notes receivable, amounting to $3.6 million and $5.1
            million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, is included in other current
            assets, net in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The trading securities and
            the noncurrent portions of the notes receivable are included in other assets, net in
            the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Canadian escrow deposit account is a
            deposit account denominated in Canadian dollars. The carrying value of this account is
            measured in U.S. dollars based on the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate of
            .9984 as of December 31, 2007. Consequently, the carrying value of the account
            approximated its fair value as of December 31, 2007, and is included in other current
            assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Long-term debt.

The carrying amount
            of borrowings outstanding under the Company's credit facility approximates fair value
            because these instruments bear interest at variable market rates. The fair values of
            each of the senior note issuances were determined based on quoted market prices for
            each of the issues. See Note F for additional information regarding the Company's

Credit facility.

During April 2007,
            the Company amended its prior credit agreement with an Amended and Restated 5-Year
            Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility") that matures in April 2012 unless
            extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility
            provides for initial aggregate loan commitments of $1.5 billion, which may be increased
            to a maximum aggregate amount of $2.0 billion if the lenders increase their loan
            commitments or if loan commitments of new financial institutions are added. As of
            December 31, 2007, the Company had $1.1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the
            Credit Facility and had $80.0 million of undrawn letters of credit under the Credit
            Facility, leaving the Company with $307.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under
            the Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be in the form of revolving
            loans or swing line loans. Aggregate outstanding swing line loans may not exceed $150
            million. Revolving loans bear interest, at the option of the Company, based on (a) a
            rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by
            JPMorgan Chase Bank or the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds
            transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding
            business day plus .5 percent or (b) a base Eurodollar rate, substantially equal to
            LIBOR, plus a margin (the "Applicable Margin") (currently .75 percent) that is
            determined by a reference grid based on the Company's debt rating. Swing line loans
            bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the "ASK" rate for Federal funds
            periodically published by the Dow Jones Market Service plus the Applicable Margin.
            Letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility are subject to a per annum fee,
            representing the Applicable Margin plus .125 percent. The Company pays commitment fees
            on the undrawn amounts under the Credit Facility that are determined by reference to a
            grid based on the Company's debt rating (.125 percent per annum at December 31,
            2007).

The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, which include
            the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization less intangible assets,
            accumulated other comprehensive income and certain noncash asset impairments not to
            exceed .60 to 1.0. The covenants also include the maintenance of a ratio of the net
            present value of the Company's oil and gas properties to total debt of at least 1.75 to
            1.0 until the Company achieves an investment grade rating by Moody's Investors Service,
            Inc. or Standard & Poors Ratings Group, Inc. The lenders

may
            declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Facility immediately due and
            payable upon the occurrence, and during the continuance of, an event of default, which

            Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

Senior notes

. During May 2006, the
            Company issued $450 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2018 and received proceeds, net
            of issuance discount and underwriting cost, of $447.4 million.

During March 2007, the Company issued $500 million of 6.65% senior notes
            due 2017 (the "6.65% Notes") and received proceeds, net of issuance discount and
            underwriting costs, of $494.8 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the
            issuance of the 6.65% Notes to reduce indebtedness under its credit
            facility.

On August 15, 2007, $32.1 million of the Company's 8.25% senior notes
            matured and were repaid with borrowings under the Company's credit facility. On January
            15, 2008, $3.8 million principal amount of the Company's 6.50% senior notes matured and
            were repaid.

Senior convertible notes.

During
            2006, holders of the $100 million of 4 3/4% Senior Convertible Notes exercised their
            conversion rights. Associated therewith, the Company paid $79.9 million in cash, issued
            2.3 million shares of common stock and recorded a $22 million increase to stockholders'
            equity.

During January 2008, the Company issued $500 million principal amount of
            2.875% convertible senior notes due 2038 (the "2.875% Senior Convertible Notes") and
            received proceeds, net of approximately $11.3 million of underwriter discounts and
            offering costs, of approximately $488.7 million. The Company used the net proceeds from
            the offering to reduce outstanding borrowings under its credit facility.

The 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes will be convertible under certain
            circumstances, using a net share settlement process, into a combination of cash and the
            Company's common stock pursuant to a formula. The initial base conversion price is
            approximately $72.60 per share (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances), which
            is equivalent to an initial base conversion rate of 13.7741 common shares per $1,000
            principal amount of convertible notes. In general, upon conversion of a note, the
            holder of such note will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and the
            Company's common stock for the note's conversion value in excess of such principal
            amount. If at the time of conversion the applicable price of the Company's common stock
            exceeds the base conversion price, holders will receive up to an additional 8.9532
            shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, as
            determined pursuant to a specified formula.

The 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes mature on January 15, 2038 (the
            "Maturity Date"). The Company may redeem the 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes for cash
            at any time on or after January 15, 2013 at a price equal to 100 percent of the
            principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the 2.875% Senior
            Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase their 2.875% Senior Convertible
            Notes for cash at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and
            unpaid interest if certain defined fundamental changes occur, as defined in the
            agreement, or on January 15, 2013, 2018, 2023, 2028 or 2033. Additionally, holders may
            convert their notes at their option in the following circumstances:

•

Following defined periods during which the reported
                            sales price of the Company's common stock exceeds 130 percent of the
                            base conversion price (initially $72.60 per share);

•

Upon notice of redemption by the Company; and

•

During the period beginning October 15, 2037, and ending
                            at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the
                            Maturity Date.

Interest on the principal amount of the 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes
            is payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning
            July 15, 2008. Beginning on January 15, 2013, during any six-month period thereafter
            from January 15 to July 14 and from July 15 to January 14, if the average trading day
            price of a 2.875% Senior Convertible Note for the five consecutive trading days
            immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six-month interest period equals
            or exceeds $1,200, interest on the principal amount of the 2.875% Senior Convertible
            Notes will be 2.375% solely for the relevant interest period.


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

The Company's senior notes and senior convertible notes are general
            unsecured obligations ranking equally in right of payment with all other senior
            unsecured indebtedness of the Company and are senior in right of payment to all
            existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Company is a holding
            company that conducts all of its operations through subsidiaries; consequently, the
            senior notes and senior convertible notes are structurally subordinated to all
            obligations of its subsidiaries. Interest on the Company's senior notes and senior
            convertible notes is payable semiannually.

Pioneer Southwest credit facility.

In October 2007, Pioneer Southwest entered into a $300 million unsecured
            revolving credit facility ("PSE Credit Agreement"), as amended, with a syndicate of
            banks. The PSE Credit Agreement would mature five years following the closing of
            Pioneer Southwest's initial public offering of limited partner interests and would
            contain certain financial covenants that would be applicable to it, including (i) the
            maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0, (ii) an interest
            coverage ratio (representing a ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense) of not less than
            2.5 to 1.0 and (iii) the maintenance of a ratio of the net present value of Pioneer
            Southwest's oil and gas assets to total debt of at least 1.75 to 1.0. Because of the
            net present value covenant, borrowings under the PSE Credit Agreement would be expected
            to be initially limited to approximately $150 million. It is a condition to the
            obligations of the lenders under the PSE Credit Agreement that Pioneer Southwest
            complete the offering. Pioneer Southwest is seeking an extension of the facility from
            the lenders. There can be no assurance that the lenders will agree to an extension, or
            if they do agree, that the terms of the facility will remain unchanged. If Pioneer
            Southwest were to seek a replacement facility, there can be no assurance that it would
            be able to do so or if it were successful, that the terms would be as favorable to
            Pioneer Southwest as the terms under the PSE Credit Agreement. See Note W for
            additional information on the Pioneer Southwest initial public offering.

Early extinguishment of debt.

During
            2006, the Company repurchased $346.2 million of its outstanding $350 million of 6.50%
            senior notes due 2008 (the "6.50% Notes"). The Company recognized a charge of $8.1
            million in 2006 associated with the early extinguishment of the 6.50% Notes, which is
            included in other expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
            During 2005, the Company (i) redeemed the remaining principal amounts of its
            outstanding 9 5/8% senior notes due 2010 and its 7.50% senior notes due 2012 of $64.0
            million and $16.2 million, respectively, and (ii) accepted tenders to purchase for cash
            $188.4 million in principal amount of its 5 7/8% senior notes due 2012. Consequently,
            the Company recognized a charge for the early extinguishment of debt of $26.5 million
            included in other expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations on
            these redemptions and tenders for 2005.

Incentive Plans

Retirement Plans

Deferred compensation retirement plan.

In August 1997, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
            (the "Board") approved a deferred compensation retirement plan for the officers and
            certain key employees of the Company. Each officer and key employee is allowed to
            contribute up to 25 percent of their base salary and 100 percent of their annual bonus.
            The Company will provide a matching contribution of 100 percent of the officer's and
            key employee's contribution limited to the first ten percent of the officer's base
            salary and eight percent of the key employee's base salary. The Company's matching
            contribution vests immediately. A trust fund has been established by the Company to
            accumulate the contributions made under this retirement plan. The Company's matching
            contributions were $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million for the years ended
            December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

401(k) plan.

The Pioneer Natural
            Resources USA, Inc. ("Pioneer USA") 401(k) and Matching Plan (the "401(k) Plan") is a
            defined contribution plan established under the Internal Revenue Code Section 401. All
            regular full-time and part-time employees of Pioneer USA are eligible to participate in
            the 401(k) Plan on the first day of the month following their date of hire.
            Participants may contribute an amount of not less than two percent nor more

than
            30 percent of their annual salary into the 401(k) Plan. Matching contributions are made
            to the 401(k) Plan in cash by Pioneer USA in amounts equal to 200 percent of a
            participant's contributions to the 401(k) Plan that are not in excess of five percent
            of the participant's base compensation (the "Matching Contribution"). Each
            participant's account is credited with the participant's contributions, Matching
            Contributions and allocations of the 401(k) Plan's earnings. Participants are fully
            vested in their account balances except for Matching Contributions and their
            proportionate share of 401(k) Plan earnings attributable to Matching Contributions,
            which proportionately vest over a four-year period that begins with the participant's
            date of hire. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
            recognized compensation expense of $10.9 million, $9.3 million and $8.0 million,
            respectively, as a result of Matching Contributions.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

In May 2006, the Company's stockholders approved a new Long-Term
            Incentive Plan, which provides for the granting of incentive awards in the form of
            stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock and
            restricted stock units to directors, officers and employees of the Company. The
            Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of 4.6 million incentive
            awards.

The following table shows the number of awards available under the
            Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan at December 31, 2007:

Approved and authorized awards

For the 2007-2008 director year, the Company's non-employee directors
            were offered a choice to receive their annual fee retainers as (i) 100 percent in
            restricted stock units, (ii) 100 percent in cash or (iii) a combination of 50 percent
            cash and 50 percent restricted stock units. All non-employee directors also received an
            annual equity grant of restricted stock units.

Compensation costs.

On January 1,
            2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(R), as more fully described in Note B, and
            eliminated $45.8 million of deferred compensation in stockholders' equity and reduced a
            like amount of additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to
            adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company recorded $56.2 million of deferred compensation
            associated with restricted stock awards in stockholders' equity during 2005. Such
            amounts will be amortized to compensation expense over the vesting periods of the
            awards.

Adoption of SFAS 123(R), required the Company to prospectively (i)
            recognize the value of the unvested stock options, which was approximately $959
            thousand and (ii) recognize compensation expense associated with the Company's ESPP.
            The Company's recognition of compensation expense attributable to restricted stock
            awards did not change upon adoption of SFAS 123(R).

As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately $34.9 million of
            unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation plan
            awards, primarily related to restricted stock and performance unit awards. As of
            December 31, 2007, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based
            compensation plan awards is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the
            remaining vesting periods of the awards, which is a remaining period of less than three
            years.

Restricted stock awards.

During
            2007, 2006 and 2005 the Company issued 831,799, 736,642 and 1,411,269, respectively,
            restricted shares of the Company's common stock as compensation to directors, officers
            and employees of the Company.

Performance unit awards.

During
            2007, the Company awarded performance units ("Performance Units") to the Company's
            corporate officers under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2007 Performance Unit awards
            were for 145,820 aggregate units, of which 142,326 units remain outstanding as of
            December 31, 2007, after cancellation of 2,677 units for forfeitures and 817 units
            lapsed by their terms during 2007. A maximum of 355,815 shares of the Company's common
            stock may be issued under the Performance Units after a 34 month service period ending
            on December 31, 2009. The actual shares, if any, to be issued at the end of the service
            period will be based on a total share return ("TSR") market objective ranking the
            Company's TSR against a defined peer group's individual TSRs.


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

The
            aggregate fair value of the outstanding Performance Units is $6.1 million, based on a
            per-unit fair value of $42.36 as of the grant date, which amount was determined using
            the Monte Carlo simulation method and is being recognized as compensation expense
            ratably over the service period. The Company recognized $1.8 million of compensation
            expense attributable to the Performance Units during 2007.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an ESPP that allows eligible employees to annually
            purchase the Company's common stock at a discounted price. Officers of the Company are
            not eligible to participate in the ESPP. Contributions to the ESPP are limited to 15
            percent of an employee's pay (subject to certain ESPP limits) during the eight-month
            offering period (January 1 to August 31). Participants in the ESPP purchase the
            Company's common stock at a price that is 15 percent below the closing sales price of
            the Company's common stock on either the first day or the last day of each offering
            period, whichever closing sales price is lower. During the years ended December 31,
            2007 and 2006, the Company recognized compensation expense of $606 thousand and $669
            thousand, respectively, associated with the ESPP.

Postretirement Benefit Obligations

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had recorded $10.5 million
            and $19.8 million, respectively, of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit
            obligations, the current and noncurrent portions of which are included in other current
            liabilities and other liabilities and minority interests, respectively, in the
            accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These obligations are comprised of five plans
            of which four relate to predecessor entities that the Company acquired in prior years.
            These plans had no assets as of December 31, 2007 or 2006. Other than the Company's
            retirement plan, the participants of these plans are not current employees of the
            Company.

At December 31, 2007, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
            pertaining to these plans were determined by independent actuaries for four plans
            representing $6.6 million of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
            and by the Company for one plan representing $3.9 million of unfunded accumulated
            postretirement benefit obligations. Interest costs at an annual rate of 6.25 percent of
            the periodic undiscounted accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were employed
            in the valuations of the benefit obligations. Certain of the aforementioned plans
            provide for medical and dental cost subsidies for plan participants. Annual medical
            cost escalation trends of ten percent in 2008, declining to five percent in 2013 and
            thereafter, and annual dental cost escalation trends of seven percent in 2008,
            declining to five percent in 2012 and thereafter, were employed to estimate the
            accumulated postretirement benefit obligations associated with the medical and dental
            cost subsidies.

The following table reconciles changes in the Company's unfunded
            accumulated postretirement benefit obligations during the years ended December 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 158 effective December 31,
            2006. The Company previously recognized the unfunded status of its defined benefit
            postretirement plans and currently recognizes periodic changes in its defined benefit
            postretirement plans as components of service costs in the period of change as allowed
            by SFAS 158. Consequently, the adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on
            the Company's liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

NOTE I.

Commitments and Contingencies

Severance agreements.

The Company
            has entered into severance and change in control agreements with its officers,
            subsidiary company officers and certain key employees. The current annual salaries for
            the parent company officers, the subsidiary company officers and key employees covered
            under such agreements total $42.0 million.

Indemnifications.

The Company has
            indemnified its directors and certain of its officers, employees and agents with
            respect to claims and damages arising from acts or omissions taken in such capacity, as
            well as with respect to certain litigation.

Legal actions.

The Company is party
            to the legal actions that are described below. The Company is also party to other
            proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve
            inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any,
            ultimately incurred with respect to such other proceedings and claims will not have a
            material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position as a whole or
            on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. The Company
            will continue to evaluate its litigation on a quarter-by-quarter basis and will
            establish and adjust any litigation reserves as appropriate to reflect its assessment
            of the then current status of litigation.

MOSH Holding

.

On April 11, 2005, the Company and its principal United States
            subsidiary, Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc., were named as defendants in MOSH
            Holding, L.P. v Pioneer Natural Resources Company; Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc.;
            Woodside Energy (USA) Inc.; and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, ("JP Morgan") as Trustee of
            the Mesa Offshore Trust, which is before the Judicial District Court of Harris County,
            Texas (334th Judicial District). Subsequently, Dagger-Spine Hedgehog Corporation
            ("Dagger-Spine") and a group of approximately fifty other unitholders ("Wiegand") each
            filed a Petition in Intervention in the lawsuit to assert the same claims as MOSH
            Holding, L.P. ("MHLP"). MHLP, Dagger-Spine and Wiegand (collectively, "Plaintiffs") are
            unitholders in the Trust, which was created in 1982 as the sole limited partner in a
            partnership that holds an overriding royalty interest in certain oil and gas leases
            offshore Louisiana and Texas. The Company owns the managing general partner interest in
            the partnership. Plaintiffs allege that the Company, together with Woodside Energy
            (USA) Inc. ("Woodside"), concealed the value of the royalty interest and worked to
            terminate the Mesa Offshore Trust ("MOT") prematurely and to capture for itself and
            Woodside profits that belong to MOT. Plaintiffs also allege breaches of fiduciary duty,
            misapplication of trust property, common law fraud, gross negligence, and breach of the
            conveyance agreement for the overriding royalty interest. The relief sought by the
            Plaintiffs includes monetary and punitive damages and certain equitable relief,
            including an accounting of expenses, a setting aside of certain farmouts, and a
            temporary and permanent injunction.

In July 2007, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment
            challenging Plaintiffs' standing to prosecute the case and seeking dismissal. The
            Company also filed a motion for summary judgment challenging the substantive merits of
            Plaintiffs' claims and seeking dismissal. These motions are pending before the
            court.

On October 26, 2007, the Plaintiffs and JP Morgan announced before the
            Court that they had reached a tentative settlement of claims pending between them. As
            part of the tentative settlement, the Plaintiffs and JP Morgan also announced their
            intention to seek Court appointment of a temporary trustee. The Company objected to the
            terms of the proposed settlement and to the proposed substitution of a temporary
            trustee in place of JP Morgan. In addition, on December 20, 2007, Pioneer filed a
            cross-claim against JP Morgan seeking, among other things, to prevent JP Morgan from
            resigning as Trustee on the grounds that the Trust Indenture requires that the Trust
            must be liquidated and terminated. On January 22, 2008, the Court issued an order
            denying the settlement and proposed trustee substitution, as well as the Company's
            cross-claim.

The Company believes the claims made by the Plaintiffs in the MOSH
            Holding lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. The
            Company cannot predict whether the outcome of this proceeding will

be
            adverse to the Company and if so, whether such an outcome will materially and
            negatively impact the Company's liquidity, financial position or future results of
            operations.

Equatorial Guinea Block H Arbitration.

On
            June 14, 2007, a subsidiary of the Company ("Pioneer EG") commenced arbitration in
            London, England against Roc Oil (Equatorial Guinea) Company ("ROC EG"), Atlas Petroleum
            International Limited ("Atlas") and Osborne Resources Limited ("Osborne") to determine
            the parties' respective rights and obligations under a joint operating agreement
            relating to well operations in Block H in deepwater Equatorial Guinea. ROC, Atlas and
            Osborne have, in turn, brought counterclaims against Pioneer EG in respect to alleged
            breaches of the farm-in agreements relating to Block H. In late 2006, the Republic of
            Equatorial Guinea ratified a new hydrocarbons law, which among other things, appears to
            entitle Equatorial Guinea to increase substantially its carried interest in all
            concessions, including Block H, either directly or through the National Oil Company. In
            addition, drilling costs for the well have increased significantly beyond those
            originally anticipated.

Given these and other factors, Pioneer EG maintains that it does not
            have an obligation to approve the drilling of a well on the block. The view of the
            other parties is that Pioneer EG does not have the right to prevent the drilling of the
            well or to refuse to pay its share of the costs thereof. ROC EG, Atlas and Osborne have
            also notified Pioneer EG that they reserve the right to claim damages should they
            suffer any loss, including any loss suffered if the underlying production sharing
            contract is terminated by Equatorial Guinea.

The parties have consolidated their respective claims under the joint
            operating agreement and the farm-in agreements into a single arbitration to be
            conducted in London, England during 2008. Pioneer EG intends vigorously to assert its
            position in the arbitration. The Company cannot predict whether the outcome of this
            proceeding will be adverse to the Company and if so, whether such an outcome will
            materially and negatively impact the Company's liquidity, financial position or future
            results of operations.

Environmental Protection Agency
            Investigation.

On November 4, 2005, the Company learned from
            the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that the agency was conducting a criminal
            investigation into a 2003 spill that occurred at a Company-operated drilling rig
            located on an ice island offshore Harrison Bay, Alaska. The investigation is being
            conducted in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska.
            The spill was previously investigated by the Alaska Department of Environmental
            Conservation ("ADEC") and, following completion of a clean up, the ADEC issued a letter
            stating its determination that, at that time, the site did not pose a threat to human
            health, safety or welfare, or the environment. The Company is fully cooperating with
            the government's investigation. The Company cannot predict whether the outcome of this
            investigation will be adverse to the Company and if so, whether such an outcome will
            materially and negatively impact the Company's liquidity, financial position or future
            results of operations.

Obligations following divestitures.

In April 2006, the Company provided the purchaser of its Argentine
            assets certain indemnifications. The Company remains responsible for certain contingent
            liabilities related to such indemnifications, subject to defined limitations. The
            Company does not believe that these obligations, which primarily pertain to matters of
            litigation, environmental contingencies, royalty obligations and income taxes, are
            probable of having a material impact on its liquidity, financial position or future
            results of operations.

The Company has also retained certain liabilities and indemnified buyers
            for certain matters in connection with other divestitures, including the sale in 2007
            of its Canadian assets.

Drilling commitments.

The Company
            periodically enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company is committed
            to expend funds to drill wells in the future. The Company also enters into agreements
            to secure drilling rig services, which require the Company to make future minimum
            payments to the rig operators. The Company records drilling commitments in the periods
            in which well capital is expended or rig services are provided.

Transportation agreements.

The
            Company is party to contractual commitments with pipeline carriers for the future
            transportation of gas production from certain of the Company's properties located in
            the Raton and Uinta Basins. The Raton Basin transportation commitments averaged
            approximately 205 million cubic feet ("MMcf") of gross gas volumes per day during 2007,
            including fuel commitments, and will average approximately 226 MMcf per day of gross
            gas volume during 2008, decreasing to approximately 219 MMcf per day per day during
            2009, 204 MMcf per day during 2010, 182 MMcf per day during 2011, 122 MMcf per day

The Uinta Basin transportation commitments commenced during June 2007
            and averaged approximately 5 MMcf of gross gas volumes per day during the second half
            of 2007, including fuel commitments, and will average approximately 8 MMcf per day
            during 2008, 13 MMcf per day during 2009 and 15 MMcf per day thereafter. The Uinta

NOTE J.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses financial derivative contracts to manage exposures to
            commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company generally
            does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
            purposes. The Company also may enter physical delivery contracts to effectively provide
            commodity price hedges. Because these contracts are not expected to be net cash
            settled, they are considered to be normal sales contracts and not derivatives.
            Therefore, these contracts are not recorded in the financial statements.

All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at estimated fair
            value. Fair value is generally determined based on the present value difference between
            the fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date,
            and/or the value confirmed by the counterparty. Changes in the fair value of effective
            cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
            (loss), which is later transferred to earnings when the hedged transaction occurs.
            Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

hedges, as well as the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value
            of hedge derivatives, are recorded in earnings. The ineffective portion is calculated
            as the difference between the change in fair value of the derivative and the estimated
            change in cash flows from the item hedged.

Fair value hedges.

The Company
            monitors the debt capital markets and interest rate trends to identify opportunities to
            enter into and terminate interest rate swap contracts with the objective of reducing
            costs of capital.

As of December 31, 2007, the carrying value of the Company's long-term
            debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets included a $3.2 million reduction
            in the carrying value attributable to net deferred hedge losses on terminated fair
            value hedges that are being amortized as net increases to interest expense over the
            original terms of the terminated agreements. The amortization of net deferred hedge
            losses on terminated interest rate swaps increased the Company's reported interest
            expense by $434 thousand and $14 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2007 and
            2006, as compared to net deferred gains amortization, which reduced the Company's
            reported interest expense by $4.1 million during the year ended December 31,
            2005.

The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2007, the scheduled
            amortization of net deferred hedge losses on terminated interest rate hedges (including
            terminated fair value and cash flow hedges) that will be recognized as increases to the
            Company's future interest expense:

Cash flow hedges.

The Company
            utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts to (i) reduce the effect of price
            volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support the
            Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity
            price risk associated with certain capital projects. As of December 31, 2007, all of
            the Company's open commodity hedges are designated as hedges of United States
            forecasted sales. The Company also, from time to time, utilizes interest rate contracts
            to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company's indebtedness and
            forward currency exchange agreements to reduce the effect of exchange rate
            volatility.

Gas prices.

The Company employs a policy of
            hedging a portion of its gas production based on the index price upon which the gas is

                            respectively.

Interest rate.

During March 2007, the
            Company entered into treasury lock contracts and designated the contracts as cash flow
            hedges of the forecasted interest rate risk associated with the coupon rate on the
            Company's 6.65% Notes, which were issued in March 2007. The Company terminated these
            contracts for a loss of $1.5 million, which was recorded in accumulated other
            comprehensive income (loss) – net deferred hedge losses, net of tax ("AOCI
            – Hedging"). The Company did not realize any ineffectiveness in connection with
            the treasury lock contracts. See Note F for information regarding the 6.65%
            Notes.

During January 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap
            contracts and designated the contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest
            rate risk associated with a portion of the Company's credit facility indebtedness. The
            interest rate swap contracts are variable-for-fixed-rate swaps on $400 million notional
            amount of debt at a weighted average fixed annual rate of 2.87 percent, excluding any
            applicable margins. The interest rate swaps have an effective start date during
            February 2008, $200 million of which terminate during February 2010 and $200 million
            during February 2011.

Hedge ineffectiveness

.

The Company recognized ineffectiveness amounts related to (i) hedged
            volumes that exceeded revised forecasts of production volumes due to delays in the
            start up of production in certain fields and (ii) reduced correlations between the
            indexes of the financial hedge derivatives and the indexes of the hedged forecasted
            production for certain fields. Ineffectiveness can be associated with closed contracts
            (i.e. realized) or can be associated with open positions (i.e. unrealized). The
            following table sets forth the hedge ineffectiveness income (loss) attributable to
            continuing operations recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the

AOCI - Hedging.

As of December 31,
            2007 and 2006, AOCI - Hedging represented net deferred losses of $228.3 and $167.2
            million, respectively. The AOCI - Hedging balance as of December 31, 2007 was comprised
            of $246.4 million of net deferred losses on the effective portions of open cash flow
            hedges, $114.7 million of net deferred losses on terminated cash flow hedges (including

flow
            interest rate hedges) and $132.8 million of associated net deferred tax benefits. The
            AOCI - Hedging balance as of December 31, 2006 was comprised of $71.0 million of net
            deferred losses on the effective portions of open cash flow hedges, $193.7 million of
            net deferred losses on terminated cash flow hedges (including $1.7 million of net
            deferred losses on terminated cash flow interest rate hedges) and $97.5 million of
            associated net deferred tax benefits. The increase in AOCI - Hedging during the year
            ended December 31, 2007 was primarily attributable to increases in future commodity
            prices relative to the commodity prices stipulated in the hedge contracts, partially
            offset by the reclassification of net deferred hedge losses to net income as
            derivatives matured by their terms. The net deferred losses associated with open cash
            flow hedges remain subject to market price fluctuations until the positions are either
            settled under the terms of the hedge contracts or terminated prior to settlement. The
            net deferred losses on terminated cash flow hedges are fixed.

During the year ending December 31, 2008, based on current estimates of
            future commodity prices, the Company expects to reclassify $157.2 million of net
            deferred losses associated with open commodity hedges and $98.9 million of net deferred
            losses on terminated commodity hedges from AOCI - Hedging to oil and gas revenues. The
            Company also expects to reclassify approximately $94.7 million of net deferred income
            tax benefits associated with commodity hedges during the year ending December 31, 2008
            from AOCI - Hedging to income tax benefit.

Terminated commodity hedges.

At
            times, the Company terminates open commodity hedge positions when the underlying
            commodity prices reach a point that the Company believes will be the high or low price
            of the commodity prior to the scheduled settlement of the open commodity position. This
            allows the Company to maximize gains or minimize losses associated with the open hedge
            positions. At the time of termination of the hedges, the amounts recorded in AOCI -
            Hedging are maintained and amortized to earnings over the periods the production was
            scheduled to occur.

The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2007, the scheduled
            amortization of net deferred losses on terminated commodity hedges that will be
            recognized as decreases to the Company's future oil and gas revenues:

Non-hedge derivatives.

During
            December 2007, the Company entered into foreign exchange rate swaps of Canadian dollars
            ("CND") for U.S. dollars ("USD"). The foreign exchange rate swaps are economic hedges
            of a CND-denominated escrow account balance that was funded during November 2007
            associated with the sale of Canadian assets (see Note V for additional information
            regarding the sale of the Company's Canadian assets); however, uncertainty regarding
            the matching of cash flow timing between the foreign exchange rate swaps and the
            liquidation of the CND-denominated escrow account caused the Company not to designate
            the foreign exchange rate swaps as hedges. The foreign exchange rate swaps mature
            during May 2008 and are for a notional amount of approximately $131.0 million USD. The
            Company recognized a loss of $1.5 million associated with these derivatives, which
            amount is included in discontinued operations in the Company's accompanying
            Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2007.

            purchaser would not have an adverse effect on the ability of the Company to sell its
            oil and gas production.

The following United States purchasers individually accounted for ten
            percent or more of the consolidated oil, NGL and gas revenues, including the revenues

            and to select, counterparties to its derivative instruments. Although the Company does
            not obtain collateral or otherwise secure the fair value of its derivative instruments,
            associated credit risk is mitigated by the Company's credit risk policies and
            procedures. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had no derivative counterparties with
            significant credit risks.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company's asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the
            future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities. The Company does not
            provide for a market risk premium associated with asset retirement obligations because
            a reliable estimate cannot be determined. The Company has no assets that are legally
            restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. The following table
            summarizes the Company's asset retirement obligation transactions during the years
            ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Asset Divestitures

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
            completed asset divestitures for net proceeds of $553.7 million, $1.6 billion and $1.2
            billion, respectively. Associated therewith, the Company recorded gains (losses) on
            disposition of assets in continuing operations of $(2.2) million, $(6.5) million and
            $60.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
            and gains of $100.2 million, $731.8 million and $166.5 million in discontinued
            operations in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following represent the
            significant divestitures:

Canadian divestiture.

In November
            2007, the Company completed the sale of its Canadian subsidiaries for net proceeds of
            $525.7 million, resulting in a gain of $101.3 million. The net proceeds from the sale
            of the Canadian subsidiaries includes $132.8 million of proceeds that were deposited by
            the purchaser into the Company's Canadian escrow account pending receipt from the
            Canada Revenue Agency of appropriate tax certifications, which were received in January
            2008. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year
            ended December 31, 2007, includes only $392.9 million of proceeds from disposition of
            assets, net of cash sold pertaining to the sale of the Canadian subsidiaries. As a
            result of this divestiture, the Company has reclassified the historic results of
            operations, comprehensive income and cash flows of its Canadian assets to discontinued
            operations in accordance with SFAS 144.

Nigeria.

In June 2007, the Company
            entered into an agreement to divest its interest in a subsidiary (owned 59 percent by
            the Company, the "Nigeria Subsidiary") that held an interest in the deepwater Nigerian
            Block 320. The agreement was subject to governmental approval. The governmental
            approval was not obtained by the deadline and as a result, Pioneer terminated the
            agreement. Also, as a result of due diligence efforts that emerged as part of the
            Company's compliance efforts, and with assistance from outside counsel, the Company
            determined that it could not, consistent with its legal obligations, fund or approve
            future operations in connection with Block 320. As a


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

result, during the third quarter of 2007 the Company engaged in a
            process to withdraw from the production sharing contract relating to Block 320 and
            related agreements. As a part of this process the Company disposed of its shares in the
            Nigeria Subsidiary to an unaffiliated third party. As a result, the Company no longer
            owns any interest in the Nigeria Subsidiary or Block 320 and will not fund or
            participate in any future operations in connection with Block 320. See Note S for
            additional information regarding the Nigerian impairment.

Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine
            divestitures.

During 2006, the Company sold its interests
            in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of
            $1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of $725.3 million and its Argentine assets for net
            proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9 million. Pursuant to SFAS 144,
            the gain and the results of operations from these assets have been reclassified to
            discontinued operations. See Note V for additional information.

Volumetric production payments.

During 2005, the Company sold three VPPs for proceeds of $892.6 million.
            No gain or loss was recognized. See Note T for additional information.

Canadian and Gulf of Mexico Shelf divestitures.

During 2005, the Company sold its interests in the Martin Creek, Conroy
            Black and Lookout Butte areas in Canada for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting
            in a gain of $138.3 million and certain assets on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net
            proceeds of $59.2 million, resulting in a gain of $27.9 million. Pursuant to SFAS 144,
            the gain and the results of operations from these assets have been reclassified to
            discontinued operations. See Note V for additional information.

East Texas divestiture.

During the
            year ended December 31, 2005, the Company sold its interests in certain East Texas
            properties for $25.3 million of net cash proceeds with no corresponding gain or loss
            recognized.

Gabon divestiture.

In 2005, the
            Company closed the sale of the shares in a Gabonese subsidiary that owned the Company's
            interest in the Olowi block for $47.9 million of net proceeds. A $47.5 million gain was
            recognized with no associated income tax effect either in Gabon or the United States.
            During 2007, Pioneer relinquished its rights to receive additional payments for
            production discovered from deeper reservoirs on the block in consideration for a
            release of certain obligations.

__________

(a)

The Company's operations in Argentina, Canada and Africa
                            periodically recognize monetary assets and liabilities in currencies
                            other than their functional currencies (see Note B for information
                            regarding the functional currencies of subsidiary entities). Associated
                            therewith, the Company realizes foreign currency remeasurement and
                            transaction gains and losses.

NOTE P.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions
            of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). The Company and its
            eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated United States federal income tax return.
            Certain subsidiaries are not eligible to be included in the consolidated United States
            federal income tax return and separate provisions for income taxes have been determined
            for these entities or groups of entities. The tax returns and the amount of taxable
            income or loss are subject to examination by United States federal, state, local and
            foreign taxing authorities. Current and estimated tax payments of $57.0 million, $153.2
            million and $41.4 million were made during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
            2005, respectively.

SFAS 109 requires that the Company continually assess both positive and
            negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax
            assets can be realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company-specific,
            oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and assesses the likelihood that
            the Company's net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") and other deferred tax
            attributes in the United States, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions will be
            utilized prior to their expiration. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company's
            valuation allowances (relating primarily to foreign tax jurisdictions) were $24.8
            million and $94.7 million, respectively.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,
            "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48") on January 1, 2007. In
            conjunction with the implementation of FIN 48, the Company analyzed its filing
            positions for open tax years in all of the foreign, federal and state jurisdictions
            where it has material tax attributes and is required to file income tax returns. Upon
            adoption, the Company believed that its income tax filing positions and deductions
            would be substantially sustained on audit and did not anticipate any significant
            adjustments. Consequently, the Company's adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material
            impact on the Company.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction,
            and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company believes
            that it is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for years before 2002.
            In December 2007, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed an examination of the
            Company's 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. The Company agreed to proposed IRS
            adjustments that resulted in a $0.6 million deferred tax benefit and a $1.8 million
            reduction of current income taxes receivable. Subsequent amendments of federal and
            state returns relating to these audit adjustments are not expected to have a
            significant effect on the Company's future results of operations or financial
            position.

In addition, the Company's 2003 through 2005 state
            income tax returns in Colorado are currently under audit and the Tunisian government is
            concluding an audit of the Company's 2002 through 2005 income tax returns for the Adam
            Concession. No significant adjustments have been proposed in Colorado or
            Tunisia.

In February 2007, the Republic of South Africa passed legislation that
            included significant new tax benefits for oil and gas activities. Effective January 1,
            2007, the Company is allowed a deduction from oil and gas income equal to 200 percent
            of exploration expenditures and 150 percent of development expenditures. Pursuant to
            the new tax legislation, the Company recorded a $15.7 million tax benefit for 2007
            associated with capital expenditures incurred after the effective date, primarily
            related to the South Coast Gas project.

Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 23
            "Accounting for Income Taxes – Special Areas," the Company historically treated
            the undistributed earnings in South Africa as permanently reinvested and did not
            provide for a U.S. tax on such earnings. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company
            made the determination that it no longer had identifiable plans to reinvest these
            earnings in South Africa and accordingly

recorded $18.9 million of U.S.
            deferred tax expense in 2007 associated with the results of operations of its South
            African subsidiaries.

During the second quarter of 2007, the Company announced actions to exit Nigeria.
            During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Company completed its disposal of the
            subsidiary holding Block 320 and relinquished


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

all its
            rights in Block 256. This exit from Nigeria allows the Company to deduct in the U.S.
            the cumulative expenditures associated with its past Nigerian activities and
            accordingly the Company has recognized a $40.9 million tax benefit in 2007.
            Additionally, the Company has relinquished all remaining rights in Gabon and has
            written off costs associated with Block H in Equatorial Guinea generating a $13.8
            million tax benefit in 2007.

The Company's income tax provision (benefit) and amounts separately
            allocated were attributable to the following items for the years ended December 31,

NOTE Q.

Income Per Share From Continuing
                            Operations

Basic income per share from continuing operations is computed by
            dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of common
            shares outstanding for the period. The computation of diluted income per share from
            continuing operations reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or
            other contracts to issue common stock that are dilutive to income from continuing
            operations were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of
            common stock that would then share in the earnings of the Company.

NOTE
            R.

Geographic Operating
            Segment Information

The Company has operations in only one industry segment, that being the
            oil and gas exploration and production industry; however, the Company is
            organizationally structured along geographic operating segments or regions. The Company
            has reportable continuing operations in the United States, South Africa, Tunisia and
            Other. Other is primarily comprised of operations in Equatorial Guinea and
            Nigeria.

During 2007, the Company sold its Canadian assets having a carrying
            value of $424.4 million. During 2006, the Company sold certain oil and gas properties
            in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and all of its Argentine assets, which had carrying
            values of $430.6 million and $658.7 million, respectively, on their dates of sale.
            During 2005, the Company sold certain Canadian and United States oil and gas properties
            having carrying values of $58.9 million and $31.4 million, respectively, on their dates
            of sale. The results of operations of those properties have been reclassified as
            discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS 144 and, aside from costs incurred for
            oil and gas activities, are excluded from the geographic operating segment information
            provided below. See Note V for information regarding the Company's discontinued
            operations.

The following tables provide the Company's geographic operating segment
            data required by SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
            Information," as well as results of operations of oil and gas producing activities
            required by SFAS No. 69, "Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities" as of and
            for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Geographic operating segment
            income tax benefits (provisions) have been determined based on statutory rates existing
            in the various tax jurisdictions where the Company has oil and gas producing
            activities. The "Headquarters" table column includes income and expenses that are not
            routinely included in the earnings measures internally reported to management on a
            geographic operating segment basis.

NOTE S.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used, including
            oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
            value of those assets may not be recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2007
            and 2005, the Company recognized aggregate impairment charges of $26.2 million and $644
            thousand, respectively.

Nigerian impairment.

In June 2007,
            the Company entered into an agreement to divest its interest in a subsidiary (owned 59
            percent by the Company, the "Nigeria Subsidiary") that held an interest in the
            deepwater Nigerian Block 320. The agreement was subject to governmental approval. The
            governmental approval was not

obtained by the deadline and as a result, Pioneer terminated the
            agreement. Based on the terms of the agreement, which established the Company's
            estimate of fair value, the Company recorded a $12.2 million noncash impairment charge
            in the second quarter of 2007 to reduce the net basis to the estimated fair value.
            Also, as a result of due diligence efforts that emerged as part of the Company's
            compliance efforts, and with assistance from outside counsel, the Company determined
            that it could not, consistent with its legal obligations, fund or approve future
            operations in connection with Block 320. As a result, during the third quarter of 2007
            the Company engaged in a process to withdraw from the production sharing contract
            relating to Block 320 and related agreements. As a part of this process, the Company
            disposed of its shares in the Nigeria Subsidiary to an unaffiliated third party and
            associated therewith, the Company recorded a reduction of $2.0 million to the previous
            noncash impairment charge. As a result, the Company no longer owns any interest in the
            Nigeria Subsidiary or Block 320 and will not fund or participate in any future
            operations in connection with Block 320.

Equatorial Guinea impairment.

During
            the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a noncash charge of $10.3 million to
            write off the Company's remaining basis in Block H in Equatorial Guinea. The charge was
            recorded in connection with the ongoing arbitration among the parties participating in
            the Block H prospect. See Note I for additional information regarding the Block H
            arbitration.

United States impairment.

During the
            second quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $5.7 million noncash impairment
            provision to reduce the carrying values of certain proved oil and gas properties
            located in Louisiana. The impairment provision was determined in accordance with SFAS
            144, and reduced the carrying values of the assets to their estimated fair
            value.

Gabon impairment.

During 2005, the
            Company recognized noncash impairment charges of $644 thousand to reduce the carrying
            value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets as development of the discovery was
            canceled.

Piceance/Uinta Basins.

During 2007,
            events and circumstances indicated that approximately $130.9 million of net assets in
            the Company's Piceance/Uinta area may have been partially impaired. However, the
            Company's estimate of undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying amounts were
            expected to be recovered. Nonetheless, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of
            undiscounted cash flows may change in the future resulting in the need to write down
            those assets to fair value.

NOTE T.

Volumetric Production Payments

During 2005, the Company sold 27.8 MMBOE of proved reserves by means of
            three VPP agreements for net proceeds of $892.6 million, including the assignment of
            the Company's obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the
            VPPs were initially used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. The first VPP sold 58 Bcf
            of gas volumes over an expected five-year term that began in February 2005. The second
            VPP sold 10.8 million barrels ("MMBbls") of oil volumes over an expected seven-year
            term that began in January 2006. The third VPP sold 6.0 Bcf of gas volumes over an
            expected 32-month term that began in May 2005 and 6.2 MMBbls of oil volumes over an
            expected five-year term that began in January 2006.

The Company's VPPs represent limited-term overriding royalty interests
            in oil and gas reserves that: (i) entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes
            over a period of time from specific lease interests; (ii) are free and clear of all
            associated future production costs and capital expenditures; (iii) are nonrecourse to
            the Company (i.e., the purchaser's only recourse is to the reserves acquired); (iv)
            transfer title to the purchaser; and (v) allow the Company to retain the remaining
            reserves after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered.

Under SFAS No. 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas
            Producing Companies," a VPP is considered a sale of proved reserves. As a result, the
            Company (i) removed the proved reserves associated with the VPPs; (ii) recognized the
            VPP proceeds as deferred revenue which are being amortized on a unit-of-production
            basis to oil and gas revenues over the terms of the VPPs; (iii) retained responsibility
            for 100 percent of the production costs and capital costs related to VPP interests; and
            (iv) no longer recognizes production associated with the VPP volumes.

Insurance Claims

Fain Plant.

During May 2005, the
            Company sustained damages as a result of a fire at its Fain gas plant in the West
            Panhandle field. The damages interrupted production from mid-May through mid-July of
            2005. The Company maintained business interruption and physical damage insurance
            coverage for such circumstances. The Company recognized a total of $17.9 million in
            business interruption recoveries and $4.4 million in physical damage recoveries
            associated with the Fain gas plant fire. The Company recognized $14.2 million of the
            business interruption recoveries in 2005 and the remaining $3.7 million in 2006, which
            is included in other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
            Operations.

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

During
            August and September 2005, the Company sustained damages as a result of Hurricanes
            Katrina and Rita at various facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Other than the East
            Cameron facility discussed further below, the damages to the facilities were covered by
            physical damage insurance.

The Company filed a business interruption claim with its insurance
            provider related to its Devils Tower field resulting from its inability to sell
            production as a result of damages to third-party facilities. During 2006, the Company
            settled its business interruption claim with its insurance provider for $18.5 million,
            which is included in income from discontinued operations in the accompanying
            Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As a result of Hurricane Rita, the Company's East Cameron facility,
            located in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, was destroyed. The Company currently estimates
            that it will cost approximately $185 million to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron
            facility. The operations to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facilities began in
            January 2007. The estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility is based
            upon an analysis prepared by a third party engineering firm for a majority of the work,
            an estimate by the Company for the remaining work that was not covered by the
            third-party analysis and actual abandonment activity to date. During 2007, 2006 and
            2005, the Company recorded additional abandonment obligation charges for changes in
            estimates of $66.0 million, $75.0 million and $39.8 million, respectively, which
            amounts are included in hurricane activity, net in the accompanying Consolidated
            Statements of Operations.

The $185 million estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron
            facilities contains a number of assumptions that could cause the ultimate cost to be
            higher or lower as there are many uncertainties when working offshore and underwater
            with damaged equipment and wellbores. The Company currently believes costs
            could


PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

range from $185 million to $205 million; however, at this point no
            better estimate than any other amount within the range can be determined, thus the
            Company has recorded the estimated provision of $185 million.

The Company filed a claim with its insurance providers regarding the
            loss at East Cameron. Under the Company's insurance policies, the East Cameron facility
            had the following coverages: (a) $14 million of scheduled property value for the
            platform, (b) $4 million of scheduled business interruption insurance after a
            deductible waiting period, (c) $100 million of well restoration and safety, in total,
            for all assets per occurrence and (d) $400 million for debris removal coverage for all
            assets per occurrence.

In December 2005, the Company received the $14 million of scheduled
            property value for the East Cameron assets and recognized a gain of $9.7 million
            associated therewith. The Company received the $4 million of business interruption
            recoveries in 2006, which is reflected in interest and other income in the accompanying
            Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
            recorded estimated insurance recoveries of $43 million, which is reflected in other
            current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet and in hurricane
            activity, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, related to the
            estimated costs for the debris removal portion of the claim as the Company believes
            that it is probable that it will be successful in asserting coverage under the debris
            removal part of its insurance coverage. During 2007, the Company received $5 million,
            reflected in hurricane activity, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, from
            one of its insurance providers related to debris removal. At the present, no recoveries
            have been reflected related to certain costs associated with plugging and abandonment
            and the well restoration and safety coverages, as the Company is working to resolve
            coverage issues regarding coverage under this section of the insurance policies. In the
            third quarter of 2007, the Company commenced legal actions against its insurance
            carriers regarding policy coverage issues, primarily related to debris removal, certain
            costs associated with plugging and abandonment, and the well restoration and safety
            coverages. However, the Company continues to expect that a substantial portion of the
            loss will be recoverable from insurance.

NOTE V.

Discontinued Operations

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company sold its
                            interests in the following significant oil and gas assets:

__________

(a)

Net proceeds do not reflect the cash payment of $164.3

(b)

In November 2007, the Company did not receive $132.8
                            million of the proceeds which was deposited in a Canadian escrow
                            account pending receipt from the Canada Revenue Agency of appropriate
                            tax certifications which were received in January 2008. See Note E for

Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. Initial Public
                            Offering (unaudited)

On January 8, 2008, Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. ("Pioneer
            Southwest"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed an amendment to its registration
            statement (subject to completion) with the SEC to sell limited partner interests. If
            the offering is completed, Pioneer Southwest would own interests in certain oil and gas
            properties currently owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin
            of West Texas. Pioneer Southwest's registration statement contemplates an offering of
            7,500,000 common units representing a 35.3 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer
            Southwest. If the offering is completed, the Company would own a 0.1 percent general
            partner interest and a 64.6 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. The
            underwriters would be granted a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional
            common units. The Company's limited partner interest would be reduced to 61.4 percent
            if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. In February 2008, the
            Company announced that the initial public offering of common units of Pioneer Southwest
            has been postponed due to market conditions and timing of the offering remains
            uncertain. There can be no assurance that Pioneer Southwest will complete the offering,
            or if completed, that the offering will be structured as described above.

Results of Operations

Information about the Company's results of operations for oil and gas
            producing activities by geographic operating segment is presented in Note R of the

Reserve Quantity Information

The estimates of the Company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2007,
            2006 and 2005, which were located in the United States, Argentina, Canada, South Africa
            and Tunisia, were based on evaluations prepared by the Company's engineers and audited
            by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Company's major properties and
            prepared by the Company's engineers with respect to all other properties. Reserves were
            estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the United States Securities and
            Exchange Commission and the FASB, which require that reserve estimates be prepared
            under existing economic and operating conditions with no provision for price and cost
            escalations except by contractual arrangements. The Company reports all reserves held
            under production sharing arrangements and concessions utilizing the "economic interest"
            method, which excludes the host country's share of proved reserves. Estimated
            quantities for production sharing arrangements reported under the "economic interest"
            method are subject to fluctuations in the commodity prices of and recoverable operating
            expenses and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to
            recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. The reserve
            estimates as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 utilized respective oil prices of
            $95.45, $60.54 and $59.62 per Bbl (reflecting adjustments for oil quality), respective
            NGL prices of $56.13, $29.82 and $36.34 per Bbl, and respective gas prices of $6.12,
            $5.13 and $6.36 per Mcf (reflecting adjustments for Btu content, gas processing and
            shrinkage).

Proved reserve quantity estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties
            inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of
            future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of
            such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and
            geological interpretation and judgment. Results of subsequent drilling, testing and
            production may cause either upward or downward revision of previous estimates. Further,
            the volumes considered to be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in prices
            and operating costs. The Company emphasizes that proved reserve estimates are
            inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than
            those of currently producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are
            expected to change as additional information becomes available in the
            future.

The following table provides a rollforward of total proved reserves by
            geographic area and in total for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, as
            well as proved developed reserves by geographic area and in total as of the beginning
            and end of each respective year. Oil and NGL volumes are expressed in MBbls, gas
            volumes are expressed in MMcf and total volumes are expressed in thousands of barrels
            of oil equivalent ("MBOE").

Production for 2007, 2006 and 2005 includes
                            approximately 17,347 MMcf, 17,364 MMcf, and 14,452 MMcf of field fuel,
                            respectively. Also, for 2007, 2006 and 2005, production includes 2,950
                            MBOE, 9,735 MBOE and 31,195 MBOE of production associated with
                            discontinued operations. See Note V for additional

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash
            Flows

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed
            by applying year-end commodity prices (with consideration of price changes only to the
            extent provided by contractual arrangements) to the estimated future production of
            proved reserves less estimated future expenditures (based on year-end costs) to be
            incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, discounted using a rate of
            ten percent per year to reflect the estimated timing of the future cash flows. Future
            income taxes are calculated by comparing undiscounted future cash flows to the tax
            basis of oil and gas properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying
            the current tax rates to the difference. The discounted future cash flow estimates do
            not include the effects of the Company's commodity hedging contracts. Utilizing
            December 31, 2007, commodity prices held constant over each hedge contract's term, the
            net present value of the Company's hedge obligations, less associated estimated income
            taxes and discounted at ten percent, was a liability of approximately $139.1 million at
            December 31, 2007.

Discounted future cash flow estimates like those shown below are not
            intended to represent estimates of the fair value of oil and gas properties. Estimates
            of fair value should also consider probable reserves, anticipated future commodity
            prices, interest rates, changes in development and production costs and risks
            associated with future production. Because of these and other considerations, any
            estimate of fair value is necessarily subjective and imprecise.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company elected to not pursue the
            development of the Clipper project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Associated
            therewith, the Company's income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of
            2007 includes a pretax exploration and abandonment charge of $72.1 million.

During November 2007, the Company sold its Canadian assets. During March
            and April 2006, the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties
            in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and its Argentine assets, respectively. These
            divestitures qualified as discontinued operations pursuant to SFAS 144. In accordance
            with SFAS 144, the Company reclassified the results of operations and gains on the
            sales of the divested assets from continuing operations to discontinued operations in
            the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note V of Notes to
            Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these
            divestitures that gave rise to the adjustments in the tables above.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

The Company's management, with the participation of its principal
            executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated, as required by Rule
            13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as
            defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this
            Report. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal
            financial officer concluded that the design and operation of the Company's disclosure
            controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be
            disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
            is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
            the SEC's rules and forms.

Changes in internal control over financial
            reporting.

There have been no changes in the Company's
            internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
            Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company's last fiscal quarter that have
            materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's
            internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
            REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
            maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal
            control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the
            Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable
            assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
            Company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
            accepted accounting principles.

As of December 31, 2007, management assessed the effectiveness of the
            Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective
            internal control over financial reporting established in "Internal Control —
            Integrated Framework", issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
            Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, management determined that the Company
            maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
            based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm
            that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this
            Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of
            the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. The
            report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
            internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, is included in this
            Item under the heading "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
            Internal Control Over Financial Reporting".


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
            REPORTING

The
            Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Pioneer
            Natural Resources Company:

We have audited Pioneer Natural Resources Company's internal control
            over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
            Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
            Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Pioneer Natural Resources
            Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
            financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
            over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal
            Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
            Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
            Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
            plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
            internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
            audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
            assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
            and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
            performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
            believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process
            designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
            reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
            accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
            over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
            maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
            transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
            assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
            financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
            that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
            authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
            assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
            disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
            statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
            reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
            of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
            inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
            policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Pioneer Natural Resources Company maintained, in all
            material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
            31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
            Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
            Pioneer Natural Resources Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the related
            consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and
            comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007,
            and our report dated February 19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion
            thereon.
