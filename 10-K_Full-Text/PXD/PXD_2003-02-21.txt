assurances  can be  given  that  the  actual  events  and  results  will  not be
materially  different  than the  anticipated  results  described  in the forward
looking statements. See "Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulation"
and  "Item 1.  Business  - Risks  Associated  with  Business  Activities"  for a
description  of various  factors  that could  materially  affect the  ability of
Pioneer Natural Resources  Company to achieve the anticipated  results described
in the forward looking statements.

Definitions of Oil and Gas Terms and Conventions Used Herein

       Within this Report,  the following oil and gas terms and conventions have
specific  meanings:  "Bbl" means a standard  barrel  containing 42 United States
gallons;  "Bcf"  means  one  billion  cubic  feet;  "BOE"  means a barrel of oil
equivalent and is a standard convention used to express oil and gas volumes on a
comparable  oil  equivalent  basis;  "Btu" means  British  thermal unit and is a
measure of the amount of energy  required to raise the  temperature of one pound
of water one degree  Fahrenheit;  "LIBOR" means London  Interbank  Offered Rate,
which is a market rate of  interest;  "MMBtu"  means one million  Btu's;  "MBbl"
means one  thousand  Bbls;  "MBOE"  means one thousand  BOE;  "MMBOE"  means one
million BOE; "Mcf" means one thousand cubic feet and is a measure of natural gas
volume;  "MMcf" means one million  cubic feet;  "NGL" means  natural gas liquid;
"NYMEX"  means The New York  Mercantile  Exchange;  "proved  reserves"  mean the
estimated  quantities  of crude oil,  natural gas and natural gas liquids  which
geological and engineering  data  demonstrate  with  reasonable  certainty to be
recoverable in future years from known  reservoirs  under existing  economic and
operating  conditions,  i.e.,  prices and costs as of the date the  estimate  is
made.  Prices include  consideration of changes in existing prices provided only
by  contractual   arrangements,   but  not  on  escalations  based  upon  future
conditions.
       (i)  Reservoirs  are  considered  proved  if  economic  producibility  is
supported by either actual production or conclusive  formation test. The area of
a reservoir  considered proved includes (A) that portion  delineated by drilling
and  defined  by  gas-oil  and/or  oil-water  contacts,  if  any;  and  (B)  the
immediately  adjoining  portions  not yet drilled,  but which can be  reasonably
judged as  economically  productive  on the basis of  available  geological  and
engineering  data. In the absence of information on fluid  contacts,  the lowest
known structural  occurrence of hydrocarbons  controls the lower proved limit of
the reservoir.
       (ii)  Reserves which can be  produced economically through application of
improved  recovery  techniques  (such as fluid  injection)  are  included in the
"proved"  classification  when  successful  testing by a pilot  project,  or the
operation of an installed  program in the  reservoir,  provides  support for the
engineering analysis on which the project or program was based.
       (iii) Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following:  (A) oil
that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified  separately as
"indicated  additional  reserves";  (B) crude oil,  natural gas, and natural gas
liquids,  the  recovery  of which is  subject  to  reasonable  doubt  because of
uncertainty as to geology, reservoir  characteristics,  or economic factors; (C)
crude oil,  natural gas,  and natural gas  liquids,  that may occur in undrilled
prospects;  and (D) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, that may be
recovered from oil shales, coal, gilsonite and other such sources.

       "Standardized  Measure"  means  the  after-tax present value of estimated
future net revenues of proved reserves,  determined in accordance with the rules
and  regulations of the United States  Securities and Exchange  Commission  (the
"SEC"),  using prices and costs in effect at the specified date and a 10 percent
discount rate; "acquisition and finding cost per BOE" means total costs incurred
divided  by the  summation  of proved  reserves  attributable  to  revisions  of
previous  estimates,  purchases  of  minerals in place and new  discoveries  and
extensions;   and  "reserve  replacement   percentage"  means,  expressed  as  a
percentage,   the  summation  of  annual  proved  reserves,   on  a  BOE  basis,
attributable to revisions of previous estimates,  purchases of minerals in place
and new discoveries and extensions divided by annual production of oil, NGLs and
gas, on a BOE basis.

       Gas equivalents  are determined under the  relative energy content method
by using the ratio of 6.0 Mcf of gas to 1.0 Bbl of oil or NGL.

       With respect  to information  on the working interest in wells,  drilling
locations and acreage,  "net" wells, drilling locations and acres are determined
by multiplying  "gross" wells,  drilling  locations and acres by Pioneer Natural
Resources Company's working interest in such wells, drilling locations or acres.
Unless otherwise  specified,  wells,  drilling  locations and acreage statistics
quoted  herein  represent  gross wells,  drilling  locations or acres;  and, all
currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars.






                                     PART I


ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

General

       Pioneer Natural Resources Company  ("Pioneer",  or  the  "Company")  is a
Delaware  corporation  whose  common  stock is listed and traded on the New York
Stock Exchange.  Pioneer is an oil and gas  exploration  and production  company
with ownership interests in oil and gas properties located in the United States,
Argentina, Canada, Gabon, South Africa and Tunisia.

       The Company's  executive offices  are located at  5205 N. O'Connor Blvd.,
Suite  1400,  Irving,  Texas  75039.  The  Company's  telephone  number is (972)
444-9001.  The Company maintains other offices in Midland,  Texas; Buenos Aires,
Argentina;  Calgary,  Canada;  Capetown,  South Africa; and Tunis,  Tunisia.  At
December 31, 2002, the Company had 979  employees,  491 of whom were employed in
field and plant operations.

Available Information

       Pioneer files annual,  quarterly,  and current reports, proxy statements,
and other documents with the SEC under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934. The
public may read and copy any  materials  that Pioneer  files with the SEC at the
SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20549. The

regarding issuers, including Pioneer, that file electronically with the SEC. The
public  can  obtain  any   documents   that  Pioneer   files  with  the  SEC  at
http://www.sec.gov.

       The Company  also  makes  available  free of  charge  on or  through  its
Internet  website  (http://www.pioneernrc.com)  its Annual  Report on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable,
amendments to those reports filed or furnished  pursuant to Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act as soon as reasonably  practicable  after it  electronically  files
such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

Mission and Strategies

       The Company's mission is to provide shareholders with superior investment
returns through strategies that maximize Pioneer's  long-term  profitability and
net asset value. The strategies  employed to achieve this mission are predicated
on  maintaining  financial   flexibility  and  capital  allocation   discipline.
Historically,  these  strategies have been anchored by the Company's  long-lived
Spraberry  oil field and Hugoton and West  Panhandle  gas fields'  reserves  and
production.  Underlying  these  fields  are  approximately  65  percent  of  the
Company's proved oil and gas reserves which have a remaining  productive life in
excess of 40 years. The stable base of oil and gas production from these fields,
combined  with:  (i)  production  from the Company's  Canyon Express gas project
which began  production in September 2002; (ii) the initial  production from the
Company's Falcon gas discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Sable oil
discovery in South Africa  expected during the second quarter of 2003; and (iii)
initial  production  from  the  Company's  Devils  Tower  oil  discovery  in the
deepwater  Gulf of Mexico  expected  during  the  first  quarter  of 2004,  will
generate  the  operating  cash flows that will provide  Pioneer  with  continued
financial flexibility.  These exploration successes represent the results of the
Company's ability to selectively reinvest capital from the long-lived Spraberry,
Hugoton and West Panhandle fields to areas offering superior investment returns.
Similarly, the Company will continue to: (a) selectively explore for and develop
proved  reserve  discoveries  in areas that offer  superior  reserve  growth and
profitability potential; (b) invest in the personnel and technology necessary to
maximize the Company's  exploration and development  successes;  and (c) enhance
liquidity,  allowing  the  Company  to take  advantage  of  future  exploration,
development  and  acquisition   opportunities.   The  Company  is  committed  to
continuing to enhance shareholder  investment returns through adherence to these
strategies.







Business Activities

       The Company  is an  independent  oil and  gas exploration and development
company.  Pioneer's  purpose is to  competitively  and  profitably  explore for,
develop and produce oil, NGL and gas  reserves.  In so doing,  the Company sells
homogenous  oil, NGL and gas units which,  except for  geographic and relatively
minor qualitative  differentials,  cannot be significantly  differentiated  from
units offered for sale by the Company's  competitors.  Competitive  advantage is
gained in the oil and gas exploration and development  industry through superior
capital  investment  decisions,  technological  innovation  and  price  and cost
management.

      Petroleum industry.  The  petroleum  industry  has  been  characterized by
fluctuating  oil, NGL and gas commodity  prices and relatively  stable  supplier
costs during the three years ended  December 31, 2002.  During and just prior to
2000, the  Organization of Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  ("OPEC") and certain
other oil exporting  nations reduced their oil export volumes.  Those reductions
in oil export volumes had a positive impact on world oil prices,  as did overall
gas supply and demand  fundamentals  on North American gas prices.  During 2001,
world oil and  North  American  gas  supply  and  demand  fundamentals  shifted,
primarily  as a result  of an  economic  recession  curtailing  demand,  causing
reductions in world oil and North  American gas prices.  During 2002,  world oil
prices increased in response to political  unrest and supply  disruptions in the
Middle East and Venezuela.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2002,  North
American gas prices improved as market fundamentals strengthened.  The Company's
outlook for 2003 commodity  prices is uncertain.  Significant  factors that will
impact 2003 commodity  prices include the final  resolution of issues  currently
impacting Iraq and Venezuela;  the extent to which members of OPEC and other oil
exporting  nations  are able to manage oil supply  through  export  quotas;  and
overall  North  American  gas supply and demand  fundamentals.  To mitigate  the
impact of volatile  commodity  prices on the Company's net asset value,  Pioneer
periodically  enters  into  commodity  hedge  contracts.  See Note J of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" for information regarding the impact to oil and gas revenues
during  2002,  2001  and 2000  from the  Company's  hedging  activities  and the
Company's open hedge positions at December 31, 2002.

      The Company.  The  Company's  asset base is  anchored by the Spraberry oil
field located in West Texas,  the Hugoton gas field located in Southwest  Kansas
and the West Panhandle gas field located in the Texas  Panhandle.  Complementing
these areas,  the Company has exploration and development  opportunities  and/or
oil and gas  production  activities in Alaska,  the United States Gulf of Mexico
and onshore Gulf Coast areas, and internationally in Argentina,  Canada,  Gabon,
South Africa and Tunisia. Combined, these assets create a portfolio of resources
and  opportunities  that are well balanced among oil, NGLs and gas, and that are
also well balanced between long-lived, dependable production and exploration and
development  opportunities.  Additionally,  the Company has a team of  dedicated
employees that  represent the  professional  disciplines  and sciences that will
allow  Pioneer to  maximize  the  long-term  profitability  and net asset  value
inherent in its physical assets.

      The Company provides administrative,  financial and  management support to
United  States and foreign  subsidiaries  that explore for,  develop and produce
oil,  NGL  and gas  reserves.  Production  operations  are  principally  located
domestically  in  Texas,   Kansas,   Louisiana  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and
internationally in Argentina and Canada.

      Production. The Company focuses its efforts towards maximizing its average
daily production of oil, NGL and gas through  development  drilling,  production
enhancement activities and acquisitions of producing properties while minimizing
the controllable costs associated with the production  activities.  During 2002,
the Company's average daily oil, NGL and gas production  decreased primarily due
to normal production  declines,  reduced Argentine demand for gas, the Company's
curtailment of Argentine  drilling  activities during the first half of 2002 and
the December  2001 sale of the Company's  Rycroft/Spirit  River field in Canada.
During 2001 and 2000,  the Company's  average daily oil, NGL and gas  production
decreased  primarily as a result of oil and gas property  divestitures that were
supportive of the Company's  debt  reduction  goal.  Production,  price and cost
information with respect to the Company's  properties for each of 2002, 2001 and
2000 is set forth under "Item 2. Properties - Selected Oil and Gas Information -
Production, Price and Cost Data".

       Drilling  activities.  The Company  seeks to  increase  its  oil  and gas
reserves,  production and cash flow through exploratory and development drilling
and  by  conducting  other  production  enhancement  activities,  such  as  well
recompletions.  During the five years  ended  December  31,  2002,  the  Company
drilled 1,810 gross (1,279.7 net) wells, 88.5 percent of which were successfully
completed  as productive wells,  at a total drilling cost  (net to the Company's







interest) of $1.6  billion.  During 2002,  the Company  drilled 229 gross (153.2
net) wells.  Drilling and facility costs (net to the Company's interest) totaled
$439.3  million  during  2002,  79  percent  of which was  spent on  development
activities  including  $221.6 million  towards  completing  the Canyon  Express,
Falcon and Devils Tower  deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects and the Sable project
offshore South Africa. The Company's current 2003 capital  expenditure budget is
expected to range from $450 million to $550  million.  Excluding the 2002 Falcon
field  and  West  Panhandle  field  acquisitions,  the  Company's  2003  capital
expenditure  budget  is  comparable  to  2002  costs  incurred  for  oil and gas
producing  activities.  Development  expenditures to complete the Falcon, Devils
Tower and Sable projects will decline to approximately  $35 million during 2003,
while aggressive  development  drilling programs in the Company's core Spraberry
oil field,  Hugoton and West Panhandle gas fields, the United States Gulf Coast,
Argentina  and  Canada  will  resume  with  approximately  twice  as many  wells
anticipated  in 2003 versus 2002.  The Company has  allocated  the budgeted 2003
capital expenditures as follows: 65 percent to development drilling and facility
activities and 35 percent to exploration activities.

      The Company believes that its current property base provides a substantial
inventory of prospects for future reserve,  production and cash flow growth. The
Company's  proved  reserves as of December 31, 2002 include  proved  undeveloped
reserves and proved  developed  reserves  that are behind pipe of 154.2  million
Bbls of oil and NGLs and 647.7 Bcf of gas.  Development  of those  reserves will
require  future  capital  expenditures.  The timing of the  development of these
reserves will be dependent upon the commodity price  environment,  the Company's
expected operating cash flows and the Company's financial condition. The Company
believes that its current portfolio of undeveloped prospects provides attractive
development  and exploration  opportunities  for at least the next three to five
years.

      Exploratory activities.  Since  1998,  the Company has devoted significant
efforts and  resources  on hiring and  developing a highly  skilled  exploration
staff  as  well  as  acquiring   and   drilling  a  portfolio   of   exploration
opportunities.   The  Company's   commitment  to  exploration  has  resulted  in
significant  discoveries  during  this time  period,  such as the 1998 Sable oil
field  discovery in South Africa;  the 1999 Aconcagua,  2000 Devils Tower,  2001
Falcon and 2003 Harrier  discoveries in the deepwater  Gulf of Mexico;  the 2001
Olowi permit discovery located in the Southern Gabon basin; and the 2002 Borj El
Khadra permit  discovery in the Ghadames  basin onshore  Southern  Tunisia.  The
Company  currently  anticipates  that  its  2003  exploration  efforts  will  be
approximately  35 percent of total 2003  expenditures  and will be  concentrated
domestically  in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico,  and  internationally  in Gabon,
South Africa and Tunisia.  Exploratory  drilling  involves  greater risks of dry
holes or failure to find commercial  quantities of hydrocarbons than development
drilling  or  enhanced  recovery  activities.  See  "Item  1.  Business  - Risks
Associated with Business Activities - Drilling activities" below.

      Asset divestitures.  The Company regularly  reviews its asset base for the
purpose of identifying  non-core assets, the disposition of which would increase
capital resources  available for other activities and create  organizational and
operational efficiencies. While the Company generally does not dispose of assets
solely for the purpose of reducing debt, such  dispositions  can have the result
of furthering the Company's  objective of financial  flexibility through reduced
debt levels.

      During 2002, 2001 and 2000,  the Company's  divestitures  consisted of the
early  termination  of derivative  hedge  contracts and the sales of oil and gas
properties and other assets for net proceeds of $118.9  million,  $113.5 million
and $102.7  million,  respectively,  which  resulted in 2002,  2001 and 2000 net
divestiture gains of $4.4 million, $7.7 million and $34.2 million, respectively.
The Company's 2002 net proceeds from asset  divestitures  were primarily derived
from the early termination of interest rate and commodity hedges and the sale of
certain gas  properties  in  Oklahoma.  The  Company's  2001  divestitures  were
primarily  derived from the early  termination  of interest  rate and  commodity
hedges, the sale of the Company's remaining  investment in the common stock of a
non-affiliated  entity and the sale of certain  oil  properties  in Canada.  The
assets that the Company  divested  during 2000 were  primarily  comprised  of an
investment in a non-affiliated  entity and  non-strategic  United States oil and
gas  properties  located in  Oklahoma,  New Mexico and  Louisiana.  The net cash
proceeds from the 2002, 2001 and 2000 asset  dispositions were primarily used to
fund additions to oil and gas properties or to reduce the Company's  outstanding
indebtedness.  See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
in  "Item  8.  Financial   Statements  and  Supplementary   Data"  for  specific
information regarding the Company's asset divestitures.

      The Company  anticipates  that it  will  continue  to  sell  non-strategic
properties  or other  assets  from time to time to  increase  capital  resources
available  for  other  activities,   to  achieve  operating  and  administrative
efficiencies and to improve profitability.








      Acquisition activities.  The Company regularly seeks to acquire properties
that   complement  its   operations,   provide   exploration   and   development
opportunities  and  potentially  provide  superior  returns  on  investment.  In
addition, the Company pursues strategic acquisitions that will allow the Company
to expand into new  geographical  areas that feature  producing  properties  and
provide  exploration/exploitation   opportunities.   During  2002,  the  Company
expended $195.5 million of acquisition capital to purchase additional  interests
in, and other assets  associated with, its Falcon field  development  project in
the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico  and its West  Panhandle  gas field and  unproved
property  interests in the Gulf of Mexico,  the Alaskan North Slope, the Borj El
Khadra  permit in Tunisia and other areas.  The Company  purchased,  through two
transactions,  an  additional  30 percent  working  interest in the Falcon field
development  and a 25 percent  working  interest  in  associated  acreage in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico for a combined  purchase  price of $61.1 million.  As a
result of these transactions, the Company owns a 75 percent working interest and
operates the Falcon field development and related exploration blocks.

      The Company also completed the purchase of the remaining 23 percent of the
rights that the Company did not already own in its core area West  Panhandle gas
field,  100 percent of the West Panhandle  reserves  attributable to field fuel,
100 percent of the related West Panhandle field gathering  system and ten blocks
surrounding  the  Company's  deepwater  Gulf  of  Mexico  Falcon  discovery.  In
connection  with these  transactions,  the  Company  recorded  a $100.4  million
increase to proved oil and gas properties,  a $3.8 million  increase to unproved
oil and gas  properties  and $1.9  million of assets held for resale;  retired a
capital cost obligation for $60.8 million; settled a $20.9 million gas balancing
receivable;  assumed  trade  and  environmental  obligations  amounting  to $5.8
million in the aggregate; and paid $140.2 million of cash.

      During 2001,  the Company  expended  $170.8 million  of capital to acquire
proved and unproved oil and gas  properties.  Excluding  cash and other  working
capital acquired, the Company paid $92.9 million, through the issuance of common
stock,  to complete  the  agreement  and plan of merger among  Pioneer,  Pioneer
Natural   Resources   USA,   Inc.  and  42  affiliated   limited   partnerships.
Additionally,  $77.9 million was spent during 2001 to acquire additional working
interests  in the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico  Aconcagua  discovery,  the related
Canyon Express gathering system and the Devils Tower project;  21 deepwater Gulf
of Mexico blocks; 250,000 acres in the Anticlinal  Campamento,  Dos Hermanas and
La Calera areas of the Neuquen Basin in Argentina;  and a 30 percent interest in
the Anaguid permit in the Ghadames basin onshore Southern Tunisia.

      During 2000,  the  Company  expended  $67.2  million to acquire proved and
unproved oil and gas properties.  Strategic  acquisitions  of proved  properties
during 2000 included  incremental  working  interests in the  deepwater  Gulf of
Mexico discovery at Devils Tower and the Company's Canadian Chinchaga gas field.
The Company  also  acquired an interest in the Camden  Hills  deepwater  Gulf of
Mexico discovery and the related Canyon Express gathering system during 2000.

      See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item
8. Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for  additional  information
regarding the Company's acquisitions.

      The Company  periodically evaluates  and pursues acquisition opportunities
(including opportunities to acquire particular oil and gas properties or related
assets;  entities  owning  oil  and  gas  properties  or  related  assets;  and,
opportunities   to  engage  in  mergers,   consolidations   or  other   business
combinations  with such entities) and at any given time may be in various stages
of  evaluating  such  opportunities.  Such  stages may take the form of internal
financial analysis, oil and gas reserve analysis, due diligence,  the submission
of an indication of interest, preliminary negotiations,  negotiation of a letter
of intent or negotiation of a definitive agreement.

Operations by Geographic Area

      The Company operates in one industry segment.  During 2002, 2001 and 2000,
the Company had oil and gas producing activities in the United States, Argentina
and Canada,  and had  exploration  and/or  development  activities in the United
States Gulf Coast area,  the Gulf of Mexico,  Argentina,  Canada,  Gabon,  South
Africa and Tunisia.  See Note P of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for geographic
operating  segment  information,  including  results of  operations  and segment
assets.







Marketing of Production

      General.  Production  from  the  Company's  properties is  marketed  using
methods that are consistent with industry  practices.  Sales prices for oil, NGL
and gas production are negotiated  based on factors  normally  considered in the
industry,  such as the spot  price for gas or the  posted  price for oil,  price
regulations,  distance from the well to the pipeline,  well pressure,  estimated
reserves, commodity quality and prevailing supply conditions.

      Significant purchasers.  During 2002,  the Company's primary purchasers of
oil were ExxonMobil Corporation ("ExxonMobil") and Plains Marketing LP
("Plains"), the Company's primary purchaser of NGLs was Williams Energy Services
("Williams") and the Company's primary  purchaser of gas was Anadarko  Petroleum
Corporation  ("Anadarko").  Approximately  seven percent of the  Company's  2002
combined  oil,  NGL and gas  revenues  were  attributable  to  sales  to each of
ExxonMobil,  Plains,  Williams and Anadarko.  The Company is of the opinion that
the loss of any one purchaser would not have an adverse effect on its ability to
sell its oil, NGL and gas production.

      Hedging  activities.   The  Company  periodically  enters  into  commodity
derivative  contracts  (swaps and  collars) in order to (i) reduce the effect of
the  volatility of price  changes on the  commodities  the Company  produces and
sells, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans
and (iii) lock in prices to protect  the  economics  related to certain  capital
projects.  See  "Item 7.  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" for a description of the Company's  hedging
activities,  "Item 7A.  Quantitative  and Qualitative  Disclosures  About Market
Risk" and Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item
8. Financial  Statements and Supplementary Data" for information  concerning the
impact to oil and gas  revenues  during 2002,  2001 and 2000 from the  Company's
commodity hedging activities and the Company's open commodity hedge positions at
December 31, 2002.

Competition, Markets and Regulation

      Competition.  The oil  and gas  industry is  highly  competitive.  A large
number  of  companies  and  individuals   engage  in  the  exploration  for  and
development of oil and gas properties, and there is a high degree of competition
for oil and gas properties suitable for development or exploration. Acquisitions
of oil and gas  properties  have  been an  important  element  of the  Company's
growth.  The Company  intends to continue to acquire oil and gas properties that
complement its operations, provide exploration and development opportunities and
potentially  provide  superior return on investment.  The principal  competitive
factors in the acquisition of oil and gas properties  include the staff and data
necessary  to  identify,  investigate  and  purchase  such  properties  and  the
financial resources necessary to acquire and develop them. Many of the Company's
competitors  are  substantially  larger and have  financial and other  resources
greater than those of the Company.

      Markets.  The  Company's  ability  to  produce  and  market  oil  and  gas
profitably depends on numerous factors beyond the Company's control.  The effect
of these factors  cannot be accurately  predicted or  anticipated.  Although the
Company  cannot  predict  the  occurrence  of events that may affect oil and gas
prices or the degree to which oil and gas prices  will be  affected,  the prices
for any oil or gas that the Company produces will generally  approximate current
market prices in the geographic region.

      Governmental  regulation.  Enterprises  that  sell  securities  in  public
markets  are subject to  regulatory  oversight  by  agencies  such as the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission.  This regulatory oversight imposes on
the Company the  responsibility  for  establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure
controls and procedures that will ensure that material  information  relating to
the Company and its  consolidated  subsidiaries  is made known to the  Company's
management  and that the financial  statements and other  financial  information
included in this Report do not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact,
or omit to state a material fact,  necessary to make the statements made in this
Report not misleading.

      Oil and gas  exploration  and  production  operations  are also subject to
various  types of  regulation  by local,  state,  federal and foreign  agencies.
Additionally,  the Company's  operations are subject to state  conservation laws
and regulations,  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and
gas properties,  the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells and
the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of wells. States and foreign
governments  generally  impose a  production  or  severance  tax with respect to







production and sale of oil and gas within their  respective  jurisdictions.  The
regulatory  burden on the oil and gas industry  increases the Company's  cost of
doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability.

      Additional  proposals and  proceedings that  might affect  the oil and gas
industry  are  considered  from time to time by  Congress,  the  Federal  Energy
Regulatory   Commission,   state  regulatory  bodies,  the  courts  and  foreign
governments.  The Company  cannot  predict when or if any such  proposals  might
become effective or their effect, if any, on the Company's operations.

      Environmental and health controls. The Company's operations are subject to
numerous  federal,  state,  local and foreign laws and  regulations  relating to
environmental and health protection.  These laws and regulations may require the
acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the type, quantities
and  concentration  of  various   substances  that  can  be  released  into  the
environment  in connection  with drilling and  production  activities,  limit or
prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness,  wetlands
and other  protected  areas and impose  substantial  liabilities  for  pollution
resulting  from oil and gas  operations.  These  laws and  regulations  may also
restrict  air  emissions or other  discharges  resulting  from the  operation of
natural gas processing  plants,  pipeline  systems and other facilities that the
Company owns.  Although the Company believes that compliance with  environmental
laws and regulations  will not have a material  adverse effect on its results of
operations or financial  condition,  risks of substantial  costs and liabilities
are  inherent  in oil and gas  operations,  and there can be no  assurance  that
significant costs and liabilities,  including potential criminal penalties, will
not be  incurred.  Moreover,  it is possible  that other  developments,  such as
stricter environmental laws and regulations or claims for damages to property or
persons  resulting  from the Company's  operations,  could result in substantial
costs and liabilities.

      The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability, without regard
to fault or the legality of the original conduct,  on certain classes of persons
with respect to the release of a  "hazardous  substance"  into the  environment.
These persons  include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where
the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of
hazardous  substances  released at the site. Persons who are or were responsible
for  releases of hazardous  substances  under CERCLA may be subject to joint and
several  liability  for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous  substances  that
have been released into the  environment  and for damages to natural  resources,
and it is not uncommon for  neighboring  landowners  and other third  parties to
file claims for personal  injury and  property  damage  allegedly  caused by the
hazardous substances released into the environment.

      The Company generates wastes, including hazardous wastes, that are subject
to the federal  Resource  Conservation  and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable
state statutes.  The United States  Environmental  Protection Agency and various
state  agencies  have  limited  the  approved  methods of  disposal  for certain
hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the
Company's oil and gas  operations  that are currently  exempt from  treatment as
hazardous  wastes may in the  future be  designated  as  hazardous  wastes,  and
therefore  be  subject  to more  rigorous  and  costly  operating  and  disposal
requirements.

      The Company currently owns or leases, and has in the past owned or leased,
properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production
of oil and gas.  Although the Company has used operating and disposal  practices
that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may
have been disposed of or released on or under the properties  owned or leased by
the Company or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for
disposal.  In addition,  some of these  properties  have been  operated by third
parties whose  treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes
was not under the Company's  control.  These  properties and the wastes disposed
thereon may be subject to CERCLA,  RCRA and  analogous  state  laws.  Under such
laws, the Company could be required to remove or remediate  previously  disposed
wastes or property  contamination or to perform remedial plugging  operations to
prevent future contamination.

      Federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that
store or otherwise  handle oil,  such as the Company,  to prepare and  implement
spill prevention control plans, countermeasure plans and facility response plans
relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution
Prevention Act of 1990 ("OPA")  amends  certain  provisions of the federal Water
Pollution  Control  Act of 1972,  commonly  referred  to as the Clean  Water Act
("CWA"), and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to
oil spills into  navigable  waters.  The OPA subjects  owners of  facilities  to
strict joint and several  liability  for all  containment  and cleanup costs and







certain other damages arising from a spill,  including,  but not limited to, the
costs of  responding  to a release of oil to surface  waters.  The CWA  provides
penalties for any discharges of petroleum products in reportable  quantities and
imposes  substantial  liability for the costs of removing a spill.  OPA requires
responsible   parties  to   establish   and   maintain   evidence  of  financial
responsibility  to cover removal costs and damages  resulting from an oil spill.
OPA calls for a  financial  responsibility  of $35  million  to cover  pollution
cleanup for offshore  facilities.  State laws for the control of water pollution
also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of
releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground.
The Company  does not believe  that the OPA,  CWA or related  state laws are any
more  burdensome  to it than they are to other  similarly  situated  oil and gas
companies.

      Many states in which the  Company operates have recently begun to regulate
naturally  occurring  radioactive  materials  ("NORM")  and NORM wastes that are
generated in connection with oil and gas exploration and production  activities.
NORM wastes  typically  consist of very low-level  radioactive  substances  that
become concentrated in pipe scale and in production equipment. State regulations
may require the testing of pipes and  production  equipment  for the presence of
NORM, the licensing of NORM-contaminated facilities and the careful handling and
disposal of NORM wastes.  The Company  believes  that the growing  regulation of
NORM will have a minimal effect on the Company's  operations because the Company
generates only a very small quantity of NORM on an annual basis.

      The Company does not believe that  its environmental  risks are materially
different  from  those  of  comparable  companies  in the oil and gas  industry.
Nevertheless, no assurance can be given that environmental laws will not, in the
future,  result in a  curtailment  of  production  or  processing  or a material
increase in the costs of production,  development,  exploration or processing or
otherwise  adversely  affect the Company's  results of operations  and financial
condition.

      The Company employs an environmental manager and environmental specialists
charged with monitoring  environmental  and regulatory  compliance.  The Company
performs an environmental  review as part of the due diligence work on potential
acquisitions,  including acquisitions of oil and gas properties.  The Company is
not aware of any material  environmental legal proceedings pending against it or
any material environmental liabilities to which it may be subject.

Risks Associated with Business Activities

      The nature of the business activities conducted by the Company subjects it
to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material
risks relating to the Company's business activities.

      Commodity prices.  The Company's  revenues,  profitability,  cash flow and
future rate of growth are highly  dependent on prices of oil and gas,  which are
affected by numerous  factors beyond the Company's  control.  Oil and gas prices
historically have been very volatile.  A significant downward trend in commodity
prices  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  revenues,
profitability and cash flow and could, under certain circumstances,  result in a
reduction in the carrying  value of the Company's oil and gas  properties and an
increase in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance.

      Drilling activities.  Drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk
that no commercially  productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.  The
cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and drilling
operations  may be  curtailed,  delayed or  canceled as a result of a variety of
factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in
formations,  equipment  failures or accidents,  adverse  weather  conditions and
shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.  The Company's future drilling
activities may not be successful and, if  unsuccessful,  such failure could have
an adverse  effect on the Company's  future  results of operations and financial
condition.  While all drilling,  whether developmental or exploratory,  involves
these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure
to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.  Because of the percentage of the
Company's  capital budget  devoted to higher risk  exploratory  projects,  it is
likely that the Company will continue to experience  exploration and abandonment
expense.

      Unproved properties.  At December 31,  2002 and 2001,  the Company carried
unproved  property  costs of $219.1  million and $187.8  million,  respectively.
United  States  generally  accepted   accounting   principles  require  periodic
evaluation of these costs on a  project-by-project  basis in comparison to their
estimated  value.   These  evaluations  will  be  affected  by  the  results  of
exploration  activities,  commodity  price  outlooks,  planned  future  sales or







expiration of all or a portion of the leases,  contracts and permits appurtenant
to such  projects.  If the quantity of  potential  reserves  determined  by such
evaluations  is not  sufficient  to  fully  recover  the cost  invested  in each
project,  the Company will recognize  noncash  charges in the earnings of future
periods.

      Acquisitions. Acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have been a
key element of the Company's  growth.  The Company's  growth  following the full
development  of its existing  property  base could be impeded if it is unable to
acquire  additional oil and gas properties on a profitable basis. The success of
any  acquisition  will depend on a number of factors,  including  the ability to
estimate  accurately  the  recoverable  volumes  of  reserves,  rates of  future
production  and future net revenues  attainable  from the reserves and to assess
possible  environmental  liabilities.  All of these  factors  affect  whether an
acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows sufficient to provide a suitable
return  on  investment.  Even  though  the  Company  performs  a  review  of the
properties  it seeks to acquire  that it believes is  consistent  with  industry
practices, such reviews are often limited in scope.

      Divestitures.  The  Company  regularly reviews its  property  base for the
purpose of  identifying  non-strategic  assets,  the  disposition of which would
increase   capital   resources   available  for  other   activities  and  create
organizational  and operational  efficiencies.  Various factors could materially
affect the ability of the Company to dispose of non-strategic assets,  including
the availability of purchasers  willing to purchase the non-strategic  assets at
prices acceptable to the Company.

      Operation of natural gas processing plants.  As of December 31,  2002, the
Company owns  interests in 11 natural gas  processing  plants and five  treating
facilities.  The  Company  operates  seven of the plants  and all five  treating
facilities. There are significant risks associated with the operation of natural
gas processing  plants.  Gas and NGLs are volatile and explosive and may include
carcinogens.  Damage to or  misoperation  of a natural gas  processing  plant or
facility  could result in an explosion  or the  discharge of toxic gases,  which
could result in significant  damage claims in addition to interrupting a revenue
source.

      Operating hazards  and uninsured  losses.  The  Company's  operations  are
subject to all the risks normally  incident to the oil and gas  exploration  and
production business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and
other  environmental  damage, any of which could result in substantial losses to
the Company due to injury or loss of life,  damage to or  destruction  of wells,
production facilities or other property,  clean-up responsibilities,  regulatory
investigations and penalties and suspension of operations.  Although the Company
currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers  reasonable and that is
similar to that maintained by comparable  companies in the oil and gas industry,
it is not fully  insured  against  certain of these risks,  either  because such
insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs  associated with
obtaining such insurance.

      Environmental.  The  oil  and  gas  business  is subject  to environmental
hazards,  such as oil spills,  gas leaks and  ruptures and  discharges  of toxic
substances or gases that could expose the Company to  substantial  liability due
to pollution and other  environmental  damage.  A variety of federal,  state and
foreign laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of the oil and gas
business.  Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject the Company
to penalties, damages or other liabilities, and compliance may increase the cost
of the Company's operations. Such laws and regulations may also affect the costs
of acquisitions.  See "Item 1. Business - Competition,  Markets and Regulation -
Environmental and health controls".

      The Company does not believe  that its environmental  risks are materially
different  from  those  of  comparable  companies  in the oil and gas  industry.
Nevertheless,  no assurance can be given that future environmental laws will not
result in a curtailment  of  production or processing or a material  increase in
the costs of  production,  development,  exploration  or processing or otherwise
adversely affect the Company's operations and financial condition. Pollution and
similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.

      Debt restrictions and availability.  The Company is a borrower under fixed
term senior notes and a corporate  credit  facility.  The terms of the Company's
borrowings  under the senior notes and the  corporate  credit  facility  specify
scheduled  debt  repayments  and  require  the  Company to comply  with  certain
associated covenants and restrictions.  The Company's ability to comply with the
debt repayment  terms,  associated  covenants and  restrictions is dependent on,
among other  things,  factors  outside the  Company's  direct  control,  such as
commodity  prices,  interest rates and competition for available debt financing.
See Note E of Notes  to Consolidated  Financial Statements included in  "Item 8.







Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for  information  regarding the
Company's outstanding debt and the terms associated therewith.

      Competition.  The oil and gas industry is highly competitive.  The Company
competes with other  companies,  producers and operators for acquisitions and in
the exploration,  development,  production and marketing of oil and gas. Some of
these competitors have substantially  greater financial and other resources than
the Company. See "Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulation".

      Government regulation. The Company's business is regulated by a variety of
federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations.  There  can be no
assurance  that  present or future  regulations  will not  adversely  affect the
Company's business and operations. See "Item 1. Business - Competition,  Markets
and Regulation".

      International operations.  At December 31, 2002,  approximately 20 percent
of the Company's  proved  reserves of oil, NGLs and gas were located outside the
United States (16 percent in Argentina,  three percent in Canada and one percent
in South Africa). The success and profitability of international  operations may
be  adversely  affected  by  risks  associated  with  international  activities,
including  economic  and  labor  conditions,  political  instability,  tax  laws
(including  host-country export, excise and income taxes and United States taxes
on foreign  subsidiaries) and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
local  currencies in which oil and gas producing  activities may be denominated.
To the extent that the Company is involved in international activities,  changes
in  exchange  rates can  adversely  affect  the  Company's  future  consolidated
financial position, results of operations and liquidity. See Critical Accounting
Estimates included in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and  Results  of  Operations"  and Note B of  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for information specific to Argentina's economic and political situation.

      Estimates of  reserves  and future  net revenues.  Numerous  uncertainties
exist in  estimating  quantities  of proved  reserves  and future  net  revenues
therefrom.  The estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues set
forth in this  Report are based on  various  assumptions,  which may  ultimately
prove to be inaccurate.  Therefore,  such  estimates  should not be construed as
accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company's proved reserves.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

      The information included in this  Report about the Company's oil,  NGL and
gas  reserves as of December  31, 2002 was based on reserve  reports  audited by
Netherland,  Sewell &  Associates,  Inc. for the Company's  major  properties in
Canada, South Africa and the United States,  reserve reports audited by Gaffney,
Cline &  Associates,  Inc. for the Company's  properties  located in the Neuquen
Basin in Argentina,  and reserve reports prepared by the Company's engineers for
all other  properties.  The reserve  audits  conducted by  Netherland,  Sewell &
Associates,   Inc.  and  Gaffney,  Cline  &  Associates,   Inc.,  in  aggregate,
represented 71 percent of the Company's  estimated proved quantities of reserves
as of December 31, 2002. The information in this Report about the Company's oil,
NGL and gas  reserves  as of  December  31,  2001 and 2000 was  based on  proved
reserves as determined by the Company's engineers.

      Numerous uncertainties exist  in estimating  quantities of proved reserves
and  in  projecting  future  rates  of  production  and  timing  of  development
expenditures,  including many factors beyond the Company's control.  This Report
contains  estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves and the related
future net revenues,  which are based on various  assumptions,  including  those
prescribed by the SEC. Actual future production,  oil and gas prices,  revenues,
taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, geologic success and quantities
of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in
the estimates and could materially  affect the estimated  quantities and related
Standardized  Measure of proved reserves set forth in this Report.  In addition,
the Company's  reserves may be subject to downward or upward  revisions based on
production  performance,  purchases  or sales of  properties,  results of future
development,  prevailing  oil and  gas  prices  and  other  factors.  Therefore,
estimates of the Standardized Measure of proved reserves should not be construed
as  accurate  estimates  of the current  market  value of the  Company's  proved
reserves.

      Standardized Measure  is a  reporting  convention  that  provides a common
basis for comparing oil and gas companies  subject to the rules and  regulations
of the SEC. It requires the use of oil and gas spot prices  prevailing as of the
date of  computation.  Consequently,  it may not reflect  the prices  ordinarily
received  or that will be received  for oil and gas  because of  seasonal  price
fluctuations or other varying market conditions. Standardized Measures as of any








date  are  not   necessarily   indicative  of  future   results  of  operations.
Accordingly,  estimates included herein of future net revenues may be materially
different from the net revenues that are ultimately received.

      The Company did not provide estimates of total proved oil and gas reserves
during 2002,  2001 or 2000 to any federal  authority  or agency,  other than the
SEC.

Proved Reserves

      The Company's proved reserves totaled  736.7 million  BOE at  December 31,
2002,  671.4  million BOE at December 31, 2001 and 628.2 million BOE at December
31,  2000,   representing   $4.1   billion,   $2.5  billion  and  $5.6  billion,
respectively,  of  Standardized  Measure or $5.1 billion,  $2.5 billion and $7.0
billion,  respectively,  on a pre-tax basis. The ten percent increase in reserve
volumes  and 65  percent  increase  in  Standardized  Measure  during  2002 were
attributable  to an increase in commodity  prices,  the purchase of  incremental
interests in two core assets and the Company's  successful capital  investments.
The seven percent  increase in proved reserve  volumes during 2001 was primarily
attributable  to the  Company's  successful  capital  investments,  while the 56
percent  decrease  in  Standardized  Measure  during 2001 was  primarily  due to
decreases in commodity prices.

      On a  BOE basis,  67  percent of the  Company's  total proved  reserves at
December 31, 2002 were proved developed  reserves.  Based on reserve information
as of December 31, 2002,  and using the  Company's  production  information  for
2002,  the  reserve-to-production  ratio  associated  with the Company's  proved
reserves was 18 years on a BOE basis.  The following table provides  information
regarding  the  Company's  proved  reserves  and  average  daily  production  by
geographic area as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002:

            PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND AVERAGE DAILY PRODUCTION


Finding Cost and Reserve Replacement

       The Company's  acquisition and  finding costs per BOE for 2002,  2001 and
2000 were $6.30, $7.49 and $4.66 per BOE, respectively.  The average acquisition
and finding cost for the three-year  period from 2000 to 2002 was $6.24 per BOE,
representing  a 32 percent  increase  over the 2001  three-year  average rate of
$4.74 per BOE. This increase was largely  attributable  to the $221.6 million of
development  capital  that the Company  spent  during 2002 to develop its Canyon
Express,  Falcon and Devils Tower development  projects in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico and its Sable development project offshore South Africa.

       During 2002, the Company replaced 258 percent of its annual production on
a BOE basis (384 percent for oil and NGLs and 144 percent for gas). During 2001,
the Company  replaced 208 percent of its annual  production  on a BOE basis (169
percent  for oil and NGLs and 245  percent for gas).  During  2000,  the Company
replaced  167 percent of its annual  production  on a BOE basis (196 percent for
oil and NGLs and 140 percent for gas).  The Company's  2002 reserve  replacement
percentage  was the result of  revisions  of previous  estimates  and  revisions
related to changes in commodity prices,  asset purchases and new discoveries and
field  extensions.   The  Company's  2001  reserve  replacement  percentage  was







primarily  impacted by asset purchases and new discoveries and field  extensions
while  the  2000  reserve  replacement  percentage  was  primarily  impacted  by
revisions related to changes in commodity prices.

Description of Properties

       As of December 31,  2002,  the Company  has production and/or development
and exploration operations in the United States, Argentina, Canada, South Africa
and Tunisia, and exploration opportunities in Gabon.

       Domestic.  The Company's  domestic  operations are located in the Permian
Basin, Mid Continent,  Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast areas of the United
States.  The Company also has unproved  properties in Alaska.  Approximately  82
percent of the Company's  domestic proved reserves are located in the Spraberry,
Hugoton  and West  Panhandle  fields.  The mature  Spraberry,  Hugoton  and West
Panhandle fields generate  substantial  operating cash flow and have a portfolio
of low risk infill drilling  opportunities.  The cash flows generated from these
fields  provide  funding for the Company's  other  development  and  exploration
activities  both  domestically  and  internationally.  During 2002,  the Company
expended  $533.6 million in domestic  acquisition,  exploration  and development
drilling  activities.  The Company has budgeted  approximately  $300 million for
domestic  acquisition,  exploration and development  drilling  expenditures  for
2003.

       Spraberry  field.   The  Spraberry  field  was  discovered  in  1949  and
encompasses  eight counties in West Texas. The field is approximately  150 miles
long and 75 miles  wide at its  widest  point.  The oil  produced  is West Texas
Intermediate  Sweet,  and the gas  produced  is  casinghead  gas with an average
energy  content of 1,400 Btu per Mcf.  The oil and gas are  produced  from three
formations,  the upper and lower  Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from
6,700 feet to 9,200 feet. The center of the Spraberry  field was unitized in the
late 1950's and early 1960's by the major oil companies; however, until the late
1980's there was very limited development activity in the field. Since 1989, the
Company has focused its development  drilling activities in the unitized portion
of the  Spraberry  field due to the dormant  condition  of the  properties.  The
Company believes the area offers excellent  opportunities to enhance oil and gas
reserves because of the hundreds of undeveloped infill drilling locations,  many
of which are reflected in the Company's  proved  undeveloped  reserves,  and the
ability to reduce operating expenses through economies of scale.

       During 2002, the Company placed 89 Spraberry wells on production, drilled
one developmental dry hole and, at December 31, 2002, had two wells in progress.
The Company plans to drill  approximately 150 development wells in the Spraberry
field during 2003.

       Hugoton field.  The Hugoton  field in  southwest  Kansas  is  one  of the
largest  producing  gas  fields in the  continental  United  States.  The gas is
produced  from the Chase and Council  Grove  formations  at depths  ranging from
2,700  feet  to  3,000  feet.  The  Company's   Hugoton   properties   represent
approximately  13 percent of the proved reserves in the field and are located on
approximately  257,000 gross acres (237,000 net acres),  covering  approximately
400 square miles. The Company has working interests in approximately 1,200 wells
in the Hugoton  field,  about 1,000 of which it  operates,  and partial  royalty
interests in approximately 500 wells. The Company owns  substantially all of the
gathering and processing  facilities,  primarily the Satanta plant, that service
its  production  from the Hugoton field.  Such  ownership  allows the Company to
control the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and associated
NGLs.

       The   Company's  Hugoton   operated  wells  are   capable  of   producing
approximately  97 MMcf of wet gas per day (i.e.,  gas production at the wellhead
before   processing  and  before  reduction  for  royalties),   although  actual
production  in  the  Hugoton  field  is  limited  by  allowables  set  by  state
regulators.  The  Company  estimates  that it and other major  producers  in the
Hugoton  field  produced at or near capacity in 2002.  During 2002,  the Company
completed four development wells in the Hugoton field and plans for 2003 include
approximately 30 wells to be drilled.

       The Company is continuing  to evaluate the feasibility of infill drilling
into the Council  Grove  Formation and may submit an  application  to the Kansas
Corporation  Commission  to allow  infill  drilling.  Such infill  drilling  may
increase  production from the Company's Hugoton  properties.  However,  until an
application  has been  approved,  the Company will not reflect any of the infill
drilling  locations as proved  undeveloped  reserves.  There can be no assurance
that the  application  will be filed or  approved,  or as to the  timing of such
approval if granted.

       West Panhandle field.  The West Panhandle  properties are  located in the
panhandle  region of Texas where  initial  production  commenced in 1918.  These
stable,  long-lived  reserves are  attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite,








Granite Wash and  fractured  Granite  formations at depths no greater than 3,500
feet.  The  Company's  gas in the West  Panhandle  field has an  average  energy
content of 1,300 Btu per Mcf and is  produced  from  approximately  600 wells on
more than 241,000 acres covering over 375 square miles.  The Company's  wellhead
gas produced  from the West  Panhandle  field  contains a high quantity of NGLs,
yielding  relatively  greater NGL volumes than realized from the Company's 1,025
Btu per Mcf content  wellhead  gas in its Hugoton  field.  In 2002,  the Company
purchased  the  remaining  rights it did not already own in the field as well as
the gathering system. The Company now controls the wells,  production equipment,
gathering system and gas processing plant for the field.

       During 2002, the Company placed 40 new wells on production, drilled three
developmental dry holes and had four wells in progress at December 31, 2002. The
Company  plans to drill  approximately  100  wells in the West  Panhandle  field
during 2003.

       Gulf of Mexico area.  In the  Gulf of  Mexico,  the Company is focused on
reserve  and  production  growth  through a  portfolio  of shelf  and  deepwater
development projects,  high-impact,  higher-risk deepwater exploration drilling,
shelf  exploration  drilling  and  exploitation  opportunities  inherent  in the
properties the Company currently has producing on the shelf. To accomplish this,
the Company has devoted  most of its domestic  exploration  efforts to these two
areas, as well as its investment in and  utilization of 3-D seismic  technology.
During  2002,  the  Company   successfully  drilled  six  development  and  four
exploratory wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and one successful exploratory
well and one successful  development well on the shelf. The Company also drilled
two  exploratory  dry holes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and one  exploratory
dry hole on the shelf during 2002.

       In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,  the Company has  sanctioned three major
development  projects,  one of which is now on  production  and two that were in
progress at December 31, 2002:

o    Canyon   Express   -   The   TotalFinaElf-operated    Aconcagua   and   the
     Marathon-operated  Camden  Hills  discoveries  in  Mississippi  Canyon were
     jointly  developed as part of the Canyon  Express gas  project.  Production
     start-up  occurred in late  September;  however,  several  operational  and
     mechanical  difficulties were encountered which has resulted in the Company
     not reaching its estimated net  production  level of 110 to 120 MMcf of gas
     per day until late January 2003.

o    Devils Tower - At the Dominion-operated Devils Tower development project in
     Mississippi Canyon, the Company  successfully  drilled two wells to explore
     for new reserves in previously  undrilled  reservoirs and to further extend
     the previously tested zones and three development  wells.  During 2001, the
     project  was  sanctioned  as a spar  development  project  with the  owners
     leasing a spar from a third  party for the life of the field.  Construction
     of the spar is in progress,  the eight producing wells on Devils Tower have
     been drilled and are awaiting  completion  and production is anticipated to
     begin  during  the first  quarter  of 2004.  The wells  will be  brought on
     sequentially  with peak production  expected to reach 12,000 to 15,000 BOEs
     per day net to the Company's 25 percent working interest.

o    Falcon - The Company-operated Falcon project is on pace to be on production
     in April 2003. Two development wells were drilled and completed during 2002
     and the final stages of the facilities  fabrication  and  installation  are
     currently underway.  Peak production from Falcon is anticipated at rates of
     approximately  130  MMcf of gas per day  net to the  Company's  75  percent
     working interest.

       During 2002,  the Company  also  participated in  two appraisal sidetrack
wells on the Marathon-operated  deepwater Gulf of Mexico Ozona Deep prospect, of
which one was a discovery.  The 2002 discovery  sidetrack appraisal well further
extended the 2001 Ozona Deep discovery that originally encountered approximately
345 feet of net oil pay in two  intervals.  The Company is currently  evaluating
possible  tie-back  opportunities  to  existing  facilities  in  the  area,  the
economics  of  which  will  determine  future   activities.   The  Company  also
successfully  drilled its  Dominion-operated  Triton prospect near Devils Tower.
Proved  reserves  were  recorded for this prospect and it will be completed as a
subsea tieback to Devils Tower.  Exploration  drilling near the Falcon discovery
began in December  2002 with the  Lightning  prospect and in January 2003 on the
H2.5 and  Harrier  prospects.  The  Lightning  and H2.5  exploratory  wells were
unsuccessful; however, the Harrier prospect was announced as a discovery in late
January 2003. It is  anticipated  that the Harrier well will be completed with a
subsea tieback to Falcon within nine to 15 months. During 2003, the Company also
plans to drill its Buff prospect, which is also near the Falcon discovery.







       During January 2003,  the Company announced a joint exploration agreement
with Woodside  Energy (USA) Inc.  ("Woodside"),  a subsidiary of Woodside Energy
Ltd. of Australia, for a two-year drilling program over the shallow- water Texas
shelf region of the Gulf of Mexico. Under the agreement, Woodside has taken a 50
percent  working  interest in 47  offshore  exploration  blocks  operated by the
Company.  The  agreement  covers eight  prospects and 19 leads and includes five
exploratory  wells to be drilled in 2003 and three in 2004. Most of the wells to
be drilled  under the  agreement  will target gas plays below 15,000  feet.  The
eight  wells to be  drilled  by the  parties  in 2003 and 2004 are on  prospects
generated  and leased by the Company since 1997.  Additionally,  the Company and
Woodside will evaluate for potential inclusion in the drilling program shallower
gas prospects on the Gulf of Mexico shelf on other blocks covered by the leases.

       Onshore Gulf Coast area.  The Company has focused its drilling efforts in
this area on the Pawnee  field in the  Edwards  Reef trend in South  Texas.  The
Company  drilled six  development  wells at Pawnee during 2002,  had one well in
progress at year end and plans to drill seven wells in 2003.

       Alaska area.  During the  fourth quarter  of 2002,  the Company signed an
agreement with Armstrong Resources LLC under which the Company was assigned a 70
percent working  interest and operatorship in ten state leases on Alaska's North
Slope.  The leases cover  approximately  14,000  undeveloped  acres  between the
Kuparuk  River unit and Thetis  Island.  The Company  plans to drill up to three
exploratory  wells during the first quarter of 2003. The wells will test an area
that the  Company  believes  is  prospective  for oil in the  same  sands as the
offsetting  Kuparuk River unit eight to ten miles to the southeast.  The Kuparuk
River unit was  discovered in 1969 and is estimated to hold 2.5 billion  barrels
of  recoverable  oil. No wells have been  drilled on the acreage  covered by the
Company's  leases to date,  but wells  drilled just outside the perimeter of the
acreage  have  encountered  the  primary  target  Kuparuk  "C"  sands  and  were
oil-bearing. The acreage is offshore in approximately five to ten feet of water.
Drilling plans call for grounded sea ice pad locations that will be accessed via
ice roads from Oliktok  Point dock.  All sea ice  operations  are expected to be
completed by the end of March 2003.

       International.  The Company's international operations are located in the
Neuquen and Austral  Basins areas of Argentina and the  Chinchaga,  Martin Creek
and Lookout Butte areas of Canada. Additionally, the Company's other significant
development  projects,  the Sable oil field  located in shallow  water  offshore
South Africa and the Adam discovery in southern Tunisia, are scheduled for first
production in mid-2003.  The Company has also entered into agreements to explore
for oil and gas reserves in South Africa,  Gabon and Tunisia. As of December 31,
2002,  approximately 16 percent, three percent, one percent and one tenth of one
percent of the Company's proved reserves are located in Argentina, Canada, South
Africa and Tunisia, respectively.

       Argentina. The  Company's  share  of  Argentine  production  during  2002
averaged  21.7  MBOE per day,  or  approximately  19  percent  of the  Company's
equivalent  production.  The  Company's  operated  production  in  Argentina  is
concentrated  in the Neuquen Basin which is located about 925 miles southwest of
Buenos  Aires and to the east of the Andes  Mountains.  Oil and gas are produced
primarily  from the Al Norte de la Dorsal,  the Al Sur de la Dorsal,  the Dadin,
the Loma Negra, the Anticlinal Campamento and the Estacion Fernandez Oro blocks,
in each of which the Company has a 100 percent working interest. Most of the gas
produced from these blocks is processed in the Company's recently completed Loma
Negra gas  processing  plant.  The Company  also  operates  and has a 50 percent
working  interest  in the Lago Fuego field which is located in Tierra del Fuego,
an island in the extreme  southern  portion of  Argentina,  approximately  1,500
miles south of Buenos Aires.

       Most of the Company's non-operated  production in Argentina is located in
Tierra del Fuego where oil, gas and NGLs are produced  from six separate  fields
in which the Company has a 35 percent working  interest.  The Company also has a
14.4 percent working  interest in the Confluencia  field which is located in the
Neuquen Basin.

       During 2002,  the Company expended $35.1 million on Argentine development
and  exploration  activities.  The Company  drilled 14 development  wells and 17
extension/exploratory   wells,   of  which  13   development   wells   and  nine
extension/exploratory  wells were  successful.  Also  during  2002,  the Company
completed  its gas  processing  plant at Loma Negra and  completed a 35 mile gas
pipeline that connects the Loma Negra plant to a main gas transmission line that
accesses the Buenos Aires gas market.  The Company plans to spend  approximately
$45  million  on oil  and  gas  development  and  exploration  opportunities  in
Argentina during 2003.







       Canada. The Company's Canadian producing properties are located primarily
in Alberta and British  Columbia,  Canada.  Production  during 2002 averaged 9.1
MBOE per  day,  or  approximately  eight  percent  of the  Company's  equivalent
production.  The Company  continues to focus its  development,  exploration  and
acquisition  activities  in the core areas of  northeast  British  Columbia  and
southwest  Alberta.   The  Canadian  assets  are  geographically   concentrated,
predominantly  shallow  gas and more than 95 percent  operated by the Company in
the following areas: Chinchaga, Martin Creek and Lookout Butte.

       Production  from the  Chinchaga  area in  northeast  British  Columbia is
relatively dry gas from  formation  depths  averaging  3,400 feet. In the Martin
Creek area of British  Columbia,  production is relatively  dry gas from various
reservoirs  ranging  from 3,700 feet to 4,300 feet.  The  Lookout  Butte area in
southwest  Alberta  produces gas and condensate  from the  Mississippian  Turner
Valley formation at approximately 12,000 feet.

       During 2002,  the Company expended $33.5 million on Canadian development,
exploration and acquisition activities. The Company drilled 17 development wells
and 12 exploratory wells,  primarily in the Chinchaga and Martin Creek areas, of
which 13  development  wells and 9 exploratory  wells were  successful.  Most of
these  wells  were  drilled  during the first  quarter  as these  areas are only
accessible  for drilling  during the winter  months.  The Company plans to spend
approximately   $45  million  on  oil  and  gas   development   and  exploration
opportunities in Canada during 2003.

       Africa. In Africa, the Company has entered into agreements to explore for
oil and gas in South  Africa,  Gabon and  Tunisia.  The  amended  South  African
agreements  cover over five  million  acres  along the  southern  coast of South
Africa, generally in water depths less than 650 feet. The Gabon agreement covers
313,937  acres off the coast of Gabon,  generally  in water depths less than 100
feet. The Tunisian  agreements can be separated into two  categories:  the first
includes three permits covering 2.9 million acres onshore southern Tunisia which
the Company  operates with a 50 percent working interest and the second includes
the Anadarko-operated Anaguid permit covering 1.2 million acres onshore southern
Tunisia  in which  the  Company  has a 38.7  percent  working  interest  and the
AGIP-operated  Borj El Khadra permit covering 1.2 million acres onshore southern
Tunisia in which the Company has a 40 percent working interest. During 2002, the
Company  expended  $70.3 million of  acquisition,  development  and  exploration
drilling and seismic capital in South Africa, Gabon and Tunisia.

       South Africa.  In  South  Africa,  the  Company  spent  $37.1  million of
drilling and seismic capital to drill four successful  development  wells on its
Petro SA-operated Sable development  project.  During 2003, the Company plans to
complete its Sable  development  project with  production  anticipated  to begin
during the second quarter of 2003.  Production for the first year is expected to
average approximately 12,100 Bbls of oil per day net to the Company's 40 percent
working  interest.  In  addition,  the  Company  currently  plans to drill three
exploration wells in South Africa during 2003.

         Gabon.  In Gabon,  the  Company  spent  $23.6  million of  drilling and
seismic  capital to drill and test  three  additional  exploratory  wells on its
Bigorneau  South prospect,  located  offshore in the Southern Gabon Basin on its
Olowi permit.  Pioneer is the operator of the permit with a 100 percent  working
interest.  To date, the Company has drilled and tested four successful  offshore
wells which have established  significant oil in place.  Full development of the
field is expected to involve  substantial  capital  investment  underscoring the
importance of confirming reservoir characteristics and productivity.  Pioneer is
currently  seeking  bids  for the  development  of an  early  production  system
covering a limited  field area which would allow the Company to gain  additional
information  needed to design a full field development plan. The Company is also
seeking improved fiscal terms from the government.

       Tunisia.  In Tunisia,  the  Company  spent  $8.2  million of acquisition,
drilling and seismic capital  primarily to acquire a 40 percent  interest in and
drill an exploration well on the AGIP-operated Borj El Khadra permit.  This well
encountered several oil and gas productive zones that tested up to 6,000 Bbls of
oil per day. The Company  plans to complete the  construction  of a 15 kilometer
flowline  from the  discovery  to an  AGIP-operated  facility  during  the third
quarter of 2003,  allowing  production  to begin from the initial  well  shortly
thereafter.  A development well is scheduled to be drilled in the fourth quarter
of 2003.  In addition  to this  development  project,  plans for Tunisia in 2003
include an exploration well to be drilled on the  Company-operated  Jorf permit,
two exploration wells to be drilled on the Anadarko-operated  Anaguid permit and
an additional exploration well to be drilled on the AGIP-operated Borj El Khadra
permit.








Selected Oil and Gas Information

       The following tables  set forth  selected oil and gas information for the
Company as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000.
Because  of  normal  production   declines,   increased  or  decreased  drilling
activities and the effects of past and future acquisitions or divestitures,  the
historical  information  presented  below  should  not be  interpreted  as being
indicative of future results.

was $24.25 per share.

       As of  February  14,  2003,  the  Company's  common  stock  was  held  by
approximately 30,951 holders of record.







ITEM 6.     SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

       The following selected consolidated financial data for the Company should
be read in  conjunction  with "Item 7.  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data".








ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
            RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2002 Financial and Operating Performance

       The year ended December 31,  2002 was  highlighted by favorable commodity
prices and  continued  strengthening  of North  American gas  fundamentals;  the
issuance of 11.5 million shares of common stock to fund  strategic  acquisitions
in the  Company's  core  areas of the West  Panhandle  gas field and the Gulf of
Mexico Falcon field  development  project;  initial  production  from the Canyon
Express gas  project;  continued  development  of the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico
Devils Tower and Falcon  fields and the Sable oil field  offshore  South Africa;
indications  that  the  Argentine  economy  and  currency  may  be  stabilizing;
continued  evaluation of the Gabon discovery;  an oil discovery in Tunisia;  the
acquisition of  undeveloped  property  interests in Alaska;  the completion of a
public  offering of $150 million of 7-1/2 percent  senior notes that will mature
in 2012;  and  repurchases  of $61.0 million of higher  yielding  funded debt to
reduce the Company's future costs of capital.

       During the years ended December 31,  2002,  2001  and  2000,  the Company
recorded net income of $26.7  million,  $100.0 million and $152.2 million ($.23,
$1.00  and  $1.53  per  diluted  share),  respectively.  Compared  to 2001,  the
Company's 2002 total revenues and other income  decreased by $159.0 million,  or
18 percent,  including a $145.2  million  decrease in oil and gas revenues.  The
decrease  in oil and gas  revenues  was due to  decreases  of five  percent,  19
percent  and 23  percent  in  average  oil,  NGL and gas  prices,  respectively,
including the effects of commodity price hedges.

       Compared to 2001,  the Company's 2002 total  costs and expenses decreased
by $105.4 million,  or 14 percent.  The decrease in total costs and expenses was
primarily reflective of a $42.0 million decrease in exploration and abandonments
expense, primarily due to the allocation of a larger percentage of the Company's
2002 capital budget to the development of the Company's Canyon Express,  Falcon,
Devils Tower and Sable projects;  a $36.1 million decrease in interest  expense,
primarily due to declining  underlying  market interest rates,  interest savings
associated with the replacement of higher yielding senior notes and capital cost
obligations  with lower  yielding  senior notes and  corporate  credit  facility
indebtedness,  interest rate hedge gains and increased  interest  capitalized on
significant  capital  projects;  and a $22.3 million  decrease in other expense,
primarily due to declines in derivative mark-to-market provisions, gas marketing
losses and bad debt expense.

       During the year ended December 31,  2002, the Company's net cash provided
by  operating  activities  decreased  to $332.2  million,  as compared to $475.6
million  during 2001 and $430.1  million  during 2000.  The decrease in net cash
provided by operating  activities  during 2002 was  primarily due to declines in
oil, NGL and gas prices as discussed above.

       During 2002,  successful  capital  investment  activities  increased  the
Company's  proved  reserves to 736.7 MMBOE,  reflecting the effects of strategic
acquisitions  of  properties  in  the  Company's  core  operating  areas  and  a
successful  drilling program which resulted in the replacement of 258 percent of
production at an acquisition and finding cost per BOE of $6.30. During the three
years ended December 31, 2002, Pioneer has replaced 210 percent of production at
an  acquisition  and finding cost per BOE of $6.24.  Costs incurred for the year
ended  December 31, 2002 totaled  $672.5  million,  including  $195.5 million of
proved and unproved property  acquisitions and $477.0 million of exploration and
development drilling and seismic expenditures.

       During the year ended December 31, 2002,  the Company purchased,  through
two transactions,  an additional 30 percent working interest in the Falcon field
development  and a 25 percent  working  interest  in  associated  acreage in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico for a combined  purchase  price of $61.1 million.  As a
result of these transactions,  the Company owns a 75 percent working interest in
and operates the Falcon field development and related  exploration  blocks. Also
during 2002,  the Company  completed the purchase of the remaining 23 percent of
the rights that the Company did not already own in its core area West  Panhandle
gas field,  100 percent of the West  Panhandle  reserves  attributable  to field
fuel, 100 percent of the related West Panhandle field  gathering  system and ten
blocks surrounding the Company's  deepwater Gulf of Mexico Falcon discovery.  In
connection  with these  transactions,  the Company  recorded  $100.4  million to
proved oil and gas  properties,  $3.8 million to unproved oil and gas properties
and $1.9 million to assets held for resale;  retired a capital  cost  obligation
for $60.8  million;  settled a $20.9 million gas balancing  receivable;  assumed
trade and environmental  obligations amounting to $5.8 million in the aggregate;
and paid $140.2 million of cash.








       See "Results of Operations" and  "Capital Commitments,  Capital Resources
and Liquidity",  below, for more  in-depth  discussions of the Company's oil and
gas  producing  activities,  including  discussions  pertaining  to oil  and gas
production  volumes,  prices,  hedging activities,  costs and expenses,  capital
commitments, capital resources and liquidity.

2003 Outlook

       Commodity  prices.   During   2001,   commodity   prices  declined   from
historically  high levels at the beginning of the year to historically  moderate
levels by year end.  World oil  prices  increased  during  2002 in  response  to
political unrest and supply disruptions in the Middle East and Venezuela. During
the third and fourth  quarters of 2002,  North  American gas prices  improved as
market  fundamentals  strengthened.  The  Company's  outlook for 2003  commodity
prices is uncertain.  Significant factors that will impact 2003 commodity prices
include the final resolution of issues  currently  impacting Iraq and Venezuela,
the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
and other oil  exporting  nations are able to manage oil supply  through  export
quotas and overall North  American gas supply and demand  fundamentals.  Pioneer
will continue to moderate its debt levels,  follow cost management  measures and
strategically  hedge  oil and gas price  risk to  mitigate  the  impact of price
volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues.

       As of December 31,  2002,  the Company had  hedged 22,236 barrels per day
("Bblpd") of 2003 oil production  under swap  contracts with a weighted  average
fixed  price to be  received  of $24.45 per Bbl.  The  Company  had also  hedged
230,000 Mcf per day of 2003 gas production  under swap contracts with a weighted
average fixed price to be received of $3.76 per MMBtu.  During January 2003, the
Company  increased  its 2003  commodity  hedge  positions by entering into 6,000
Bblpd of March oil swap  contracts  with average per Bbl fixed prices of $33.51.
Additionally,  at December 31, 2002 the Company has deferred oil hedge losses of
$.5 million that will be recognized as reductions to oil revenue during the last
eight  months  of 2003  and  $72.5  million  of gas  hedge  gains  that  will be
recognized  as  increases  to gas revenue  during  2003.  See Note J of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data" for  additional  information  regarding the Company's  open
hedge  positions  at December  31,  2002.  Also see "Item 7A.  Quantitative  and
Qualitative  Disclosures  About Market Risk" for disclosures about the Company's
commodity related derivative financial instruments.

       First quarter 2003.  Based on current estimates, the Company expects that
its first  quarter  worldwide  production  will average 120 to 128 MBOE per day.
Included in the mid-point of the estimate is 95 MMcf per day, net to the Company
from Canyon  Express.  First  quarter  production  costs are expected to average
$5.10 to $5.40 per BOE  based on  recent  NYMEX  strip  prices  for oil and gas.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is expected to average $5.75 to
$6.00 per BOE, and total  exploration and abandonment  expense is expected to be
$20 million to $50 million. General and administrative expense is expected to be
$16 million to $17 million  during the first  quarter of 2003,  $2 million to $3
million of which relates to estimated additional performance-based  compensation
costs.  Interest expense is expected to be $24 million to $26 million.  Interest
capitalized  during the first  quarter of 2003 will be  significantly  less than
interest  capitalized  during the first three  quarters of 2002 as the Company's
largest  capital  project for which interest was being  capitalized,  the Canyon
Express  development  project,  was put into production  during  September 2002.
Additionally,  during February 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap
contracts  to hedge a  portion  of the fair  value of its 9-5/8  percent  senior
notes.  Under the terms of the interest  rate swap  contracts,  the Company will
receive a fixed annual rate of 9-5/8 percent on $250 million notional amount and
will pay the  counterparties a variable rate on the notional amount equal to the
six-month LIBOR,  reset  semi-annually,  plus a weighted average margin of 566.4
basis  points.  Income  taxes,  principally  in  Argentina,  are  expected to be
approximately  $2 million as the Company  benefits from the  carryforward of net
operating losses in the United States and Canada.

       Production growth.  The Company  expects  that its  annual 2003 worldwide
production  will be  approximately  165 MBOE per day,  an increase of 45 percent
over 2002  levels.  The  growth  in  production  during  2003  includes  initial
production during the second quarter from the Company's deepwater Gulf of Mexico
Falcon gas project and the Sable oil project in South Africa,  coupled with peak
rates of production  from Canyon  Express and  increases in production  from the
Company's core  properties in the United States,  Argentina and Canada due to an
aggressive  development  drilling program with approximately twice as many wells
anticipated in 2003 versus 2002.

       Capital expenditures.  During 2003,  the Company's budget for oil and gas
producing  activities is expected to range from $450 million to $550 million, of
which  approximately  35 percent has been budgeted for exploration  expenditures
and 65 percent has been budgeted for  development  drilling and facility  costs.
The Company's 2003  capital budget is  allocated approximately 60 percent to the






United  States,  nine percent to Argentina  and Canada and 22 percent to Africa.
The Company's 2003 capital budget includes $35 million of remaining  development
capital to  complete  the Falcon and Devils  Tower  development  projects in the
deepwater  Gulf of Mexico  and the  Sable oil  project  offshore  South  Africa.
Aggressive  development  drilling  programs in the Company's  core Spraberry oil
field,  Hugoton and West  Panhandle  gas fields,  the United  States Gulf Coast,
Argentina  and  Canada  will  resume  with  approximately  twice  as many  wells
anticipated  in  2003  versus  2002.   During  2003,  the  Company  has  planned
exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, the onshore Gulf Coast area, Alaska,
Canada,  Gabon,  Tunisia and South Africa.  During the years ended  December 31,
2004 and 2005, the Company expects to expend approximately $172 million and $151
million,  respectively,  of capital for development  drilling and facility costs
related to its proved undeveloped reserves.

Critical Accounting Estimates

       The Company prepares its consolidated financial  statements for inclusion
in this Report in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  that are  generally
accepted  in the United  States  ("GAAP").  See Note B of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for a  comprehensive  discussion of the Company's  significant  accounting
policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules
and requirements,  the application of which requires  management  judgements and
estimates including,  in certain circumstances,  choices between acceptable GAAP
alternatives.   Following  is  a  discussion  of  the  Company's  most  critical
accounting  estimates,  judgements  and  uncertainties  that are inherent in the
Company's application of GAAP:

       Accounting for oil and gas  producing activities.  The accounting for and
disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the Company's management
to choose between GAAP  alternatives  and to make judgements  about estimates of
future uncertainties.

       Successful  efforts  method  of  accounting.  The  Company  utilizes  the
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing  activities as
opposed to the alternate  acceptable full cost method.  In general,  the Company
believes that, during periods of active  exploration,  net assets and net income
are  more  conservatively  measured  under  the  successful  efforts  method  of
accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method.
The critical  difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and
the full  cost  method  is as  follows:  under the  successful  efforts  method,
exploratory  dry holes and  geological  and  geophysical  exploration  costs are
charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas,  under
the full cost method of accounting,  such costs and expenses are  capitalized as
assets,  pooled  with the costs of  successful  wells and  charged  against  the
earnings of future  periods as a component  of depletion  expense.  During 2002,
2001 and 2000, the Company recognized exploration,  abandonment,  geological and
geophysical  expense  of  $85.9  million,  $127.9  million  and  $87.6  million,
respectively, under the successful efforts method.

       Proved reserve estimates.  Estimates  of the  Company's  proved  reserves
included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines.
The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:

       o      the quality and quantity of available data;
       o      the interpretation of that data;
       o      the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and
       o      the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.

       The Company's  proved reserve  information  included in this Report as of
December  31, 2002 was based on  evaluations  audited by  independent  petroleum
engineers  with respect to the Company's  major  properties  and prepared by the
Company's  engineers with respect to all other properties.  The Company's proved
reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was
based on evaluations prepared by the Company's engineers.  Estimates prepared by
other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein.

       Because  these  estimates  depend on  many assumptions,  all of which may
substantially  differ from future  actual  results,  reserve  estimates  will be
different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately  recovered.  In
addition,  results of  drilling,  testing  and  production  after the date of an
estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate.

       The Company's  stockholders should not  assume that the present value of
future net cash flows is the current  market  value of the  Company's  estimated






proved  reserves.  In accordance  with SEC  requirements,  the Company based the
estimated  discounted  future net cash flows from proved  reserves on prices and
costs on the  date of the  estimate.  Actual  future  prices  and  costs  may be
materially  higher  or lower  than the  prices  and  costs as of the date of the
estimate.

       The Company's  estimates of  proved reserves  materially impact depletion
expense.  If the  estimates of proved  reserves  decline,  the rate at which the
Company  records  depletion  expense will increase,  reducing future net income.
Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic
to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition,  the decline in proved
reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Company's  assessment of its oil
and gas producing properties for impairment.

       Impairment of  proved  oil and gas  properties.  The  Company reviews its
long-lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management judges that
events  or  circumstances  indicate  that  the  recorded  carrying  value of the
properties  may  not  be  recoverable.  Management  assesses  whether  or not an
impairment  provision is  necessary  based upon  management's  outlook of future
commodity  prices and net cash flows that may be  generated  by the  properties.
Proved oil and gas properties  are reviewed for  impairment by depletable  pool,
which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated.

       Impairment  of unproved  oil and gas properties.  Management periodically
assesses   individually   significant   unproved  oil  and  gas  properties  for
impairment,  on a  project-by-project  basis.  Management's  assessment  of  the
results of exploration  activities,  commodity  price  outlooks,  planned future
sales or expiration  of all or a portion of such projects  impact the amount and
timing of impairment provisions.

       Assessments  of   functional   currencies.    Management  determines  the
functional  currencies of the Company's  subsidiaries  based on an assessment of
the  currency  of the  economic  environment  in  which a  subsidiary  primarily
realizes and expends its operating revenues, costs and expenses. The U.S. dollar
is the  functional  currency of all of the  Company's  international  operations
except Canada.  The  assessment of functional  currencies can have a significant
impact on periodic results of operations and financial position.

       Argentine  economic  and  currency  measures.   The  accounting  for  and
remeasurement of the Company's  Argentine balance sheets as of December 31, 2002
and 2001 reflect management's assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to
Argentina's  current  economic  situation.  See Note B of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for a description of the assumptions  utilized in the preparation of these
financial  statements.  The Argentine economic and political situation continues
to evolve and the Argentine  government may enact future regulations or policies
that, when finalized and adopted,  may materially impact, among other items, (i)
the realized  prices the Company  receives for the  commodities  it produces and
sells;  (ii) the timing of  repatriations  of excess cash flow to the  Company's
corporate   headquarters  in  the  United  States;  (iii)  the  Company's  asset
valuations; and (iv) peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.

       Deferred tax  asset  valuations.  Management  periodically  assesses  the
probability of recovery of recorded  deferred tax assets based on its assessment
of future earnings outlooks by tax  jurisdiction.  Such estimates are inherently
imprecise. Many assumptions are utilized in the assessments that may prove to be
materially incorrect in the future.

New Accounting Pronouncements

       During June 2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")
issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 143,  "Accounting  for
Asset  Retirement  Obligations" ("SFAS  143").  SFAS  143  amends  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 19, "Financial  Accounting and Reporting by
Oil and Gas Producing Companies" ("SFAS 19") to require that the fair value of a
liability  for an asset  retirement  obligation  be  recognized in the period in
which it is incurred if a reasonable  estimate of fair value can be made.  Under
the provisions of SFAS 143, asset retirement obligations are capitalized as part
of the carrying value of the long-lived asset.  Under the provisions of SFAS 19,
asset retirement obligations are recognized using a cost-accumulation  approach.
The Company currently records  significant asset retirement  obligations through
the unit-of-production  method, except for such liabilities that were assumed in
business  combinations,  which were recorded at their estimated fair values. The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003.

       The adoption of SFAS 143 resulted in a January 1,  2003 cumulative effect
adjustment  to record (i) a $13.8  million  increase in the  carrying  values of







proved  properties,  (ii) a $26.3 million decrease in accumulated  depreciation,
depletion,  and  amortization  of property,  plant and  equipment,  (iii) a $1.0
million  increase in current  abandonment  liabilities  and (iv) a $22.4 million
increase  in  noncurrent  abandonment  liabilities.  The net impact of items (i)
through (iv) was to record a gain of $16.7 million,  net of tax, as a cumulative
effect  adjustment  of  a  change  in  accounting  principle  in  the  Company's
consolidated statements of operations upon adoption on January 1, 2003.

       During April 2002,  the FASB  issued  Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of
FASB  Statement No. 13 and  Technical  Corrections"  ("SFAS 145").  Prior to the
adoption  of  the  provisions  of  SFAS  145,  gains  or  losses  on  the  early
extinguishment  of debt were required to be  classified in a company's  periodic
consolidated  statements of operations as extraordinary  gains or losses, net of
associated  income  taxes,  after  the  determination  of  income  or loss  from
continuing  operations.  SFAS 145  requires,  except  in the case of  events  or
transactions of a highly unusual and infrequent nature, gains or losses from the
early  extinguishment  of debt to be  classified  as  components  of a company's
income or loss from continuing operations. The Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS 145 on January 1, 2003.  The adoption of the  provisions of SFAS 145 is not
expected to affect the Company's  future financial  position or liquidity.  Upon
adoption  of the  provisions  of SFAS  145,  gains  or  losses  from  the  early
extinguishment  of debt recognized in the Company's  consolidated  statements of
operations  for the  years  ended  December  31,  2002,  2001 and  2000  will be
reclassified   to  other   revenues  or  other   expense  and  included  in  the
determination of the income (loss) from continuing operations of those periods.

Results of Operations

       Oil and gas revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations totaled $701.8
million  during  2002,  as  compared  to $847.0  million  during 2001 and $852.7
million during 2000,  representing a 17 percent  decrease from 2001 to 2002. The
revenue  decrease from 2001 to 2002 was due to  year-on-year  worldwide  average
gas,  NGL and oil price  declines  of 23 percent,  19 percent and five  percent,
respectively,  including the effects of gas and oil price  hedges;  and an eight
percent  decline in worldwide  oil  production,  offset by worldwide NGL and gas
production increases of four percent and two percent,  respectively. The revenue
decrease from 2000 to 2001 was due to a four percent  decline in BOE  production
and a 15 percent decline in NGL price, partially offset by a 15 percent increase
in gas price,  including  the effects of gas hedges.  The declines in 2001 sales
volumes were primarily attributable to normal well production declines.







       The following  table provides  production and  price data relevant to the
analysis of the Company's revenues from oil and gas operations:


       Hedging activities.  The  commodity  prices that the  Company reports are
based on the market price received for the  commodities  adjusted by the results
of the Company's hedging activities.  The Company utilizes commodity  derivative
contracts  (swaps  and  collars)  in order to (i)  reduce  the  effect  of price
volatility on the commodities the Company  produces and sells,  (ii) support the
Company's  annual  capital  budgeting  and  expenditure  plans and (iii)  reduce
commodity price risk associated  with certain  capital  projects.  The effective
portions of changes in the fair values of the  Company's  commodity  price hedge
derivatives are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders' equity until
the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective
portions of commodity  price hedge  derivatives  add volatility to the Company's
reported   stockholders'  equity  until  the  hedge  derivative  matures  or  is
terminated. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information concerning
the impact to oil and gas revenues during 2002, 2001 and 2000 from the Company's
hedging activities,  the Company's open hedge positions at December 31, 2002 and
descriptions of the Company's hedge and non-hedge  commodity  derivatives.  Also
see "Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures  About Market Risk" for
additional disclosure about the Company's commodity related derivative financial
instruments.

       Interest and other revenue.  The  Company  recorded  interest  and  other
income  totaling  $11.2 million,  $21.8 million and $25.8 during 2002,  2001 and
2000,  respectively.  The  Company's  interest and other income was comprised of
revenue that was not directly  attributable to oil and gas producing  activities
or oil and gas  property  divestitures.  See  Note L of  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for additional information regarding interest and other income.







       Gain (loss) on disposition of assets.  During the year ended December 31,
2002,  the  Company   realized  $118.9  million  of  cash  proceeds  from  asset
divestitures and, associated therewith,  recorded net gains of $4.4 million. The
proceeds derived from asset divestitures during 2002 included $91.3 million from
the  early  termination  of  hedge  derivatives,  $20.9  million  from  the cash
settlement of a gas balancing receivable,  $4.7 million from the sale of certain
gas  properties  located in  Oklahoma  and $2.0  million  from the sale of other
corporate  assets.  The Company recorded a gain of $2.8 million  associated with
the sale of the gas  properties  in Oklahoma and a gain of $1.6 million from the
sale of other corporate assets. The proceeds from the early termination of hedge
derivatives represent deferred hedge gains and losses that will be recognized as
increases  or  decreases  to future  interest  expenses  or  future  oil and gas
revenues.  See Note J of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements included in
"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information  regarding
the amortization of deferred hedge gains and losses.

       During the year ended  December 31,  2001,  the  Company  realized $113.5
million of cash  proceeds from asset  divestitures  and,  associated  therewith,
recorded net gains of $7.7 million. The proceeds derived from asset divestitures
during   2001 included  $85.4  million  from  the  early  termination  of  hedge
derivatives,  $12.7 million from the sale of the Company's remaining holdings in
the common  stock of a  non-affiliated  entity,  $12.0  million from the sale of
certain  oil  properties  in  Canada  and  $3.4  million  from the sale of other
corporate  assets.  The Company recorded a gain of $8.1 million from the sale of
the remaining holdings in the common stock of the non-affiliated  entity, a loss
of $1.1  million  from  the  sales of oil and gas  properties  and a gain of $.7
million from the sale of other corporate assets.

       During 2000,  the Company completed the divestiture of certain assets for
proceeds of $102.7 million.  Associated  therewith,  the Company  recorded a net
gain on disposition of assets of $34.2 million.  The 2000 divestitures  included
the sale of common  stock of a  non-affiliated  entity for net proceeds of $59.7
million,  from which the Company  recognized a gain on  disposition of assets of
$34.3  million.  The Company also sold certain oil and gas producing  properties
and other  assets  during  2000 for  proceeds of $43.0  million,  from which the
Company recognized a loss on disposition of assets of $.1 million.

       The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2002,  2001 and 2000
were used,  together with net cash flows  provided by operating  activities,  to
fund additions to oil and gas properties and to reduce outstanding indebtedness.
See Note M of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in "Item 8.
Financial   Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for  additional   information
regarding asset divestitures.

       Production costs.  Total production  costs per  BOE  decreased in 2002 by
four percent and increased in 2001 by 16 percent.  In general,  lease  operating
expenses and workover expenses represent the components of production costs over
which the Company has management  control,  while  production  taxes, ad valorem
taxes and field fuel expenses are directly  related to commodity  price changes.
The decrease in  production  costs during 2002 was primarily due to decreases in
field fuel  expense and  production  taxes as a result of lower  North  American
average gas prices and lower Argentine lease operating  expenses  resulting from
lower  Argentine  expenses  on  a  U.S.  dollar  equivalent  basis  due  to  the
devaluation of the Argentine peso versus the U.S.  dollar,  partially  offset by
moderately higher workover expenses,  ad valorem taxes (which are computed using
prior year average annual commodity  prices) and declines in the third party gas
processing  and  treating  margin  component  of lease  operating  expense.  The
increase in production costs during 2001 was primarily due to increases in field
fuel expense as a result of higher North American average gas prices,  higher ad
valorem  taxes and to declines in the third party gas  processing  and  treating
margin component of lease operating  expenses.  The following table provides the
components of the Company's production costs during the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000:









       Depletion,  depreciation and  amortization expense.  The  Company's total
depletion,  depreciation and amortization  expense per BOE was $5.22,  $5.35 and
$4.93  for the years  ended  December  31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.
Depletion  expense,  the  largest  component  of  depletion,   depreciation  and
amortization, was $5.01, $5.02 and $4.57 per BOE during the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,  respectively,  and  depreciation  and  amortization of
other property and equipment was $.21,  $.33 and $.36 per BOE during each of the
respective  years.  The  decrease  in  depreciation  and  amortization  of other
property  and  equipment  during  2002  was  primarily  comprised  of  decreases
associated with fully amortized information  technology assets. During 2001, the
increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily associated with decreases in
United  States  production,  which had a lower cost basis  relative  to combined
Argentine and Canadian per BOE cost basis,  and to downward  revisions to proved
reserves as a result of lower commodity prices.

       Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs. Exploration,
abandonments,  geological and  geophysical  costs totaled $85.9 million,  $127.9
million and $87.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.  The  following  table sets forth the  components of the Company's
2002,  2001 and 2000  exploration  and  abandonments/geological  and geophysical
costs:


       The   decrease  in   2002  exploration,   abandonments,   geological  and
geophysical costs reflected a decline in Argentine exploration activities as the
Company  monitored and assessed the economic  environment  and risks  associated
with  Argentina;   a  decline  in  exploratory  dry  holes  and  geological  and
geophysical costs in Africa,  as the Company assessed its exploratory  successes
in Gabon and Tunisia; and the allocation of a larger percentage of the Company's
2002 capital  budget to the  development of its  significant  discoveries in the
Gulf of Mexico and  offshore  South  Africa.  The  increase in 2001  exploration
costs,  as compared to 2000,  was  primarily  due to  increased  geological  and
geophysical  costs  that were  supportive  of  exploratory  drilling,  increased
exploratory  drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Argentina and an exploratory dry
hole drilled in Tunisia.  Approximately  20 percent of the Company's  2002 costs
incurred for oil and gas producing activities were exploration costs as compared
to 34 percent in 2001 and 38 percent in 2000.

       General  and   administrative  expenses.    The   Company's  general  and
administrative  expenses  totaled $48.4 million  ($1.17 per BOE),  $37.0 million
($.89 per BOE) and $33.3 million ($.76 per BOE) during the years ended  December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The increase in administrative  expense
during  2002 as  compared  to  2001  was  primarily  due to the  elimination  of
operating   overhead   being  charged  by  the  Company  to  the  42  affiliated
partnerships  that were merged  into a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of the Company
during  December 2001 (see "Financial and Operating  Performance"  and Note D of
Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  "Item 8.  Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the 2001
merger). Additionally, the Company awarded 645,445 shares of restricted stock to
directors,  officers  and key  employees as part of the  Company's  compensation
program. The Company recorded $16.2 million of deferred compensation  associated
with the restricted stock awards, which amount will be amortized to compensation
expense during the vesting  periods of the awards.  Amortization of the deferred
costs of the restricted stock increased general and  administrative  expenses by
$1.9 million in 2002. See Note G of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements
included  in   "Item  8.   Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for






information regarding the restricted stock awards and their vesting periods. The
increase in general and administrative expense during 2001, as compared to 2000,
was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense.

         Interest expense.  Interest expense was  $95.8 million,  $132.0 million
and  $162.0  million  for the years  ended  December  31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.  The decline in 2002  interest  expense as  compared to 2001,  was
primarily  due to  incremental  interest  savings  of  $18.0  million  from  the
Company's  interest rate hedging  program;  a $6.3 million  increase in interest
capitalized;  interest savings from the retirement of the Company's  outstanding
11-5/8  percent and 10-5/8 percent  senior  subordinated  notes during the third
quarter of 2001 and $38.7 million of the  Company's  9-5/8 percent  senior notes
during the fourth quarter of 2001; interest savings from the repurchase of $47.1
million of 9-5/8 percent  senior notes and $13.9 million of 8-7/8 percent senior
notes during 2002; interest savings from the repayment of the $45.2 million West
Panhandle  gas field  capital  obligation in July 2002 which bore interest at an
annual rate of 20 percent;  and interest  savings from  reductions in underlying
market interest rates.  The decrease in interest expense for 2001 as compared to
2000 was primarily due to incremental  interest savings of $7.0 million from the
Company's  interest rate hedging  program;  a $6.0 million  increase in interest
capitalized;  and  interest  savings  associated  with  the  redemption  of  the
Company's  outstanding  11-5/8 percent and 10-5/8  percent  senior  subordinated
notes and $38.7 million of the Company's 9-5/8 percent senior notes.

       As is  discussed in  "2003  Outlook"  above,  capitalized  interest  will
decline during 2003, as compared to 2002 levels, primarily due to the completion
of the  Canyon  Express  development  project  during  September  2002  and  the
anticipated  completion of the Falcon and Sable development  projects during the
second quarter of 2003. Additionally,  2003 interest expense will be impacted by
fair  value  hedges  of the  Company's  9-5/8  percent  senior  notes  that were
initiated  by the  Company  during  February  2003 and for which  more  detailed
information  is provided in "2003  Outlook"  and in "Item 7A.  Quantitative  and
Qualitative  Disclosures About Market Risk". See Note E of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for additional  information about the Company's  long-term debt,  interest
expense and extraordinary items.

       Other expenses.  Other  expenses  were  $17.3  million  during  2002,  as
compared to $39.6  million  during 2001 and $67.2  million  during  2000.  Other
expenses during 2002 were primarily  comprised of a $6.9 million charge from the
remeasurement of the Company's  Argentine  peso-denominated  net monetary assets
and liabilities  and $2.5 million of marketing  losses incurred to transport and
sell purchased  Canadian gas to a Chicago,  Illinois sales point. See Note B and
Note I of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in "Item 8.
Financial   Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for  additional   information
regarding currency remeasurement and gas transportation commitments.

       Other expenses in  2001  include  $11.4  million of  commodity derivative
settlements  that  did not  qualify  for  hedge  treatment  under  Statement  of
Financial Accounting  Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging Activities";  $9.9 million of marketing losses incurred to transport
and sell purchased Canadian gas to a Chicago, Illinois sales point; $7.7 million
of losses from the remeasurement of the Company's Argentine peso-denominated net
monetary  assets and an  adjustment  to reduce the  carrying  value of Argentine
lease and well  equipment  inventory to market  value;  $6.0 million of bad debt
expense related to derivative  contracts with Enron North America Corp. and $4.6
million of other expenses.

       The primary  component of other  expense during 2000 was $58.5 million of
mark-to-market  losses on  derivative  contracts  that did not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment,  including $43.9 million of losses on derivative contracts
that  matured  during  2000 and  $14.6  million  of losses  associated  with the
Company's Btu swap  agreements  that mature at the end of December 2004.  During
2001, the Company  entered into  offsetting  swap  agreements that had fixed the
prices  that are to be  received  and  paid by the  Company  under  the Btu swap
agreements.  Consequently,  the Btu swap  agreements are no longer  sensitive to
changes in oil or gas commodity prices.

       Income tax provisions (benefits).  The  Company  recognized  consolidated
income tax  provisions  of $5.1 million and $4.0  million  during 2002 and 2001,
respectively, and a consolidated income tax benefit of $6.0 million during 2000.
The Company's  consolidated  tax provision for the year ended  December 31, 2002
was  comprised  of current U.S.  state and local taxes of $.2  million,  current
foreign  taxes of $2.1  million  and  deferred  foreign tax  provisions  of $2.8
million.  The Company's  consolidated  tax provision for the year ended December
31, 2001 was  comprised of current U.S.  state and local taxes of $1.1  million,
current foreign taxes of $10.5 million and deferred foreign tax benefits of $7.6
million. The Company's consolidated tax benefit in 2000 was comprised of a $10.6
million  deferred tax benefit in Argentina,  partially offset by $4.6 million of
current taxes paid in Argentina.






       Due to uncertainties  regarding the  Company's ability to realize certain
of its net operating loss  carryovers and tax credit  carryovers  prior to their
scheduled  expirations,  the Company has  established  a valuation  allowance of
$277.2 million  against those  carryovers.  Although the Company  believes it is
more likely than not that the  carrying  values of its  remaining  deferred  tax
assets will be realized  through  future  taxable  earnings or  alternative  tax
planning strategies, the net deferred tax assets could be reduced further if the
Company's estimate of taxable income in future periods is significantly  reduced
or alternative tax planning strategies are no longer viable. As a result of this
situation,  it is likely that the  Company's  effective tax rate in 2003 will be
minimal  in the  United  States  and  Canada  and  approximately  35  percent in
Argentina.  See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information  regarding
the  Company's  income  tax,  deferred  tax  asset  valuation  reserves  and net
operating loss carryforward expirations.

       Extraordinary items.  During 2002,  the Company repurchased $47.1 million
of its 9-5/8  percent  senior notes,  $13.9 million of its 8-7/8 percent  senior
notes and repaid a $45.2 million West Panhandle  field capital cost  obligation.
Associated  with  the 2002  debt  extinguishments,  the  Company  recognized  an
extraordinary  loss, net of taxes,  of $22.3  million.  During 2001, the Company
redeemed the remaining  $22.5 million of its  outstanding  11-5/8 percent senior
subordinated  notes,  $6.8  million of its  outstanding  10-5/8  percent  senior
subordinated  notes and  repurchased  $38.7 million of its 9-5/8 percent  senior
notes.  Associated with these debt  extinguishments,  the Company  recognized an
extraordinary  loss,  net of taxes,  of $3.8 million.  During 2000,  the Company
replaced  its prior  credit  facility,  which was  scheduled to mature in August
2002, with a new $575 million  corporate  credit facility due March 1, 2005 (the
"Credit  Agreement").  Associated  therewith,  the  Company  recognized  a $12.3
million  extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt. See "New Accounting
Pronouncements",   above,  for  information  regarding  future  changes  in  the
classification of the Company's extraordinary gains and losses.

Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity

       Capital  commitments.  The  Company's  primary  needs  for  cash  are for
exploration,  development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties,  repayment
of  contractual  obligations  and  working  capital  obligations.   Funding  for
exploration,  development  and  acquisitions  of  oil  and  gas  properties  and
repayment  of  contractual  obligations  may be provided by any  combination  of
internally-generated  cash flow,  proceeds from the disposition of non-strategic
assets or  alternative  financing  sources as discussed  in "Capital  resources"
below.  Funding for the Company's  working  capital  obligations  is provided by
internally-generated cash flow.

       Oil and gas properties.  The Company's cash expenditures for additions to
oil and gas properties during 2002, 2001 and 2000 totaled $614.7 million, $529.7
million and $299.7 million,  respectively.  The Company's 2002  expenditures for
additions to oil and gas  properties  were funded by $332.2  million of net cash
provided  by  operating   activities,   $118.9  million  of  proceeds  from  the
disposition  of assets and a portion of the  proceeds  from the issuance of 11.5
million  shares of the Company's  common stock during April 2002.  The Company's
2001  expenditures were internally funded by $475.6 million of net cash provided
by  operating  activities  and a portion  of the  Company's  $113.5  million  of
proceeds from  disposition of assets.  The Company's  2000 capital  expenditures
were internally funded by net cash provided by operating activities.

       The Company strives to  maintain its indebtedness at reasonable levels in
order to provide  sufficient  financial  flexibility to take advantage of future
opportunities.  The Company's  capital budget for 2003 is expected to range from
$450 million to $550  million.  The Company  believes  that net cash provided by
operating  activities  during 2003 will be  sufficient  to fund the 2003 capital
expenditures budget.

       Contractual obligations,  including  off-balance  sheet obligations.  The
Company's contractual  obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, Btu
swap agreements,  terminated commodity hedges and other contracts.  From time to
time, the Company enters into  off-balance  sheet  arrangements and transactions
that can give rise to material off- balance sheet obligations of the Company. As
of  December  31,  2002,  the  material   off-balance  sheet   arrangements  and
transactions  that the  Company has entered  into  include (i) $27.2  million of
undrawn  letters of credit  issued under the  Company's  $575 million  corporate
credit  facility and (ii) operating lease  agreements  under which the Company's
future minimum lease commitments are summarized in the table below and in Note I
of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in "Item 8. Financial
Statements  and  Supplementary  Data".  Contractual  obligations  for  which the
ultimate  settlement  amounts are not fixed and determinable  include derivative
contracts  that are sensitive to future  changes in commodity  prices,  currency
exchange rates and interest rates and gas transportation commitments.  See "Item






7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About Market Risk" for a table of
changes  in the fair  value of the  Company's  derivative  contract  assets  and
liabilities  during  the year  ended  December  31,  2002 and Note I of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data" for  additional  information  regarding gas  transportation
commitments. The following table summarizes the Company's payments due by period
for fixed and determinable contractual obligations:


     Capital resources.  The Company's  primary capital  resources  are net cash
provided  by  operating  activities,  proceeds  from  financing  activities  and
proceeds  from sales of  non-strategic  assets.  The Company  expects that these
resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments in 2003.

     Operating activities.  Net cash  provided by  operating  activities  during
2002,  2001 and 2000 were $332.2  million,  $475.6  million and $430.1  million,
respectively.  Net cash provided by operating  activities  in 2002  decreased by
$143.4 million, or 30 percent, as compared to that of 2001. The decrease in 2002
net cash provided by operating  activities  was  principally  due to declines in
commodity  prices,  offset partially by declines in interest  expense.  Net cash
provided by  operating  activities  in 2001  increased by $45.5  million,  or 11
percent,  as compared to that of 2000. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to
higher commodity prices as compared to 2000, declines in interest expense and an
increase in trade receivable collections.

     Financing  activities.  During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2002,  the
Company's  financing  activities  provided $170.9 million of cash,  comprised of
$236.0 million of proceeds, net of issuance costs, from the sale of 11.5 million
shares of the  Company's  common  stock;  $48.0  million  of net  borrowings  of
long-term  debt;  and $14.4  million of proceeds  from the exercise of long-term
incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases.  Partially offsetting
these cash proceeds from financing activities were $124.2 million of payments of
noncurrent  liabilities  and $3.3 million of debt issuance costs during 2002. In
contrast,  during the years ended  December 31, 2001 and 2000,  the Company used
$64.0  million  and  $244.1  million,  respectively,  of net  cash in  financing
activities.  During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company used
$5.1 million and $177.3 million of cash, respectively,  to repay long-term debt;
$53.4 million and $29.8 million,  respectively, to repay noncurrent liabilities;
$13.0 million and $27.3 million,  respectively, to purchase treasury stock; and,
during the year ended  December 31, 2000,  $13.8  million for deferred  loan and
debt issuance costs. Partially offsetting the above described net cash uses from
financing  activities  were $7.5 million and $4.2  million of net cash  provided
from the exercise of long-term  incentive  plan stock options and employee stock
purchases during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Over the three year period ended December 31,  2002,  the  Company has used
$134.4  million  of cash for net  reductions  in  long-term  borrowings  and has
reduced  its ratio of debt to book  capitalization  to 55 percent as of December
31, 2002, from 69 percent as of December 31, 1999. Additionally, the Company has
entered  into  financing  transactions  with the intent of reducing its costs of
capital and increasing liquidity through the extension of debt maturities.

     During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company entered into
interest rate swap contracts to hedge the fair value of its 6-1/2 percent senior
notes,  its 8-7/8 percent senior notes and its 8-1/4 percent  senior notes.  The
Company also entered into interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of its interest
rate risk under the Credit Agreement.  In 2002 and 2001, the Company  terminated
its open interest rate swap portfolios to lock in the substantial  fair value of
the  derivatives.  As of December  31,  2002,  the Company had $35.7  million of







deferred gains associated with the interest rate swap  terminations  recorded as
an increase in the carrying value of the Company's  long-term  debt.  During the
years ended  December  31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  net gains from the  Company's
interest rate swaps have reduced interest expense by $25.3 million, $7.3 million
and $.3 million,  respectively.  See Note J of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements included in "Item 8. Financial  Statements and Supplemental Data" and
"Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About Market Risk" for more
information about the Company's interest rate hedging activities.

     As is further described in  "Results of Operations" above,  during the year
ended  December 31, 2002,  the Company  repurchased  $47.1  million of its 9-5/8
percent senior notes, $13.9 million of its 8-7/8 percent senior notes and repaid
a $45.2 million West Panhandle gas field capital cost obligation.  Additionally,
during the year ended  December 31,  2001,  the Company  redeemed its  remaining
11-5/8 percent and 10-5/8 percent senior subordinated notes and $38.7 million of
its 9-5/8 percent senior notes.

     At December 31,  2002,  the Company had a  $575.0 million  corporate credit
facility  with a syndicate of banks that  matures on March 1, 2005.  Outstanding
borrowings  under the corporate  credit  facility  totaled  $260.0 million as of
December 31, 2002.  In addition,  the Company has five  outstanding  senior note
issuances  at  December  31,  2002.  Such debt  issuances  consist of (i) $136.1
million  aggregate  principal  amount of 8-7/8 percent senior notes due in 2005;
(ii) $150 million  aggregate  principal amount of 8-1/4 percent senior notes due
in 2007; (iii) $350 million  aggregate  principal amount of 6-1/2 percent senior
notes due in 2008; (iv) $339.2 million aggregate  remaining  principal amount of
9-5/8 percent  senior notes due in 2010;  (v) $150 million  aggregate  principal
amount  of 7-1/2  percent  senior  notes  due in 2012;  and  (vi)  $250  million
aggregate principal amount of 7-1/5 percent senior notes due in 2028. Certain of
the obligations above contain restrictive  covenants,  each of which the Company
is in compliance.

     The weighted average  interest rate on the  Company's  indebtedness for the
year ended  December  31, 2002 was 5.74  percent as compared to 7.52 percent for
the year ended  December 31, 2001 and 8.68  percent for the year ended  December
31, 2000,  taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.  See Note E of
Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  "Item 8.  Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data" for more specific  information  regarding the
Company's long-term debt as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.

     As the Company  pursues  its strategy,  it may  utilize  various  financing
sources,  including  fixed  and  floating  rate  debt,  convertible  securities,
preferred  stock or common  stock.  The  Company  may also issue  securities  in
exchange for oil and gas  properties,  stock or other interests in other oil and
gas  companies  or  related  assets.  Additional  securities  may be of a  class
preferred  to common  stock  with  respect  to such  matters  as  dividends  and
liquidation  rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined
by the Company's Board of Directors.

       Sales of non-strategic assets.  During 2002, 2001 and 2000, proceeds from
the sale of  non-strategic  assets  totaled $118.9  million,  $113.5 million and
$102.7  million,   respectively.   The  Company's  2002,  2001  and  2000  asset
divestitures   were   comprised  of  hedge   derivatives,   common  stock  of  a
non-affiliated  entity, and non-strategic United States and Canadian oil and gas
properties,  gas plants and other assets.  The cash proceeds received from asset
divestitures  during 2002 and 2001 were used to fund a portion of the  Company's
2002 and 2001 capital  expenditures and for general corporate  obligations.  The
net cash  proceeds  from the 2000  asset  divestitures  were used to reduce  the
Company's outstanding indebtedness (see "Results of Operations", above, and Note
M of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in "Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data").

       Book capitalization  and liquidity.  The Company's  total debt was  $1.67
billion as of December 31, 2002,  as compared to total debt of $1.58  billion on
December 31, 2001 and 2000. The Company's total book  capitalization at December
31,  2002 was $3.04  billion,  consisting  of total  debt of $1.67  billion  and
stockholders'   equity  of  $1.37   billion.   The   Company's   debt  to  total
capitalization  was 55 percent at December  31,  2002.  The  Company's  ratio of
current assets to current  liabilities  was .54 at December 31, 2002 and 1.12 at
December  31,  2001.  The decline in the  Company's  ratio of current  assets to
current liabilities was primarily due to a $170.7 million difference in the fair
value of 2003 maturing  derivatives at December 31, 2002 as compared to the fair
value of 2002 maturing derivatives at December 31, 2001. Including $27.2 million
of undrawn and outstanding  letters of credit, the Company has $287.8 million of
unused  borrowing  capacity  available under its Credit Agreement as of December

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

       The following quantitative and qualitative  information is provided about
financial  instruments  to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2002
and 2001,  and from which the  Company  may incur  future  gains or losses  from
changes in market interest rates,  foreign  exchange rates or commodity  prices.
Although  certain  derivative  contracts  that the  Company is a party to do not
qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial
instruments for trading purposes.

       The fair value of the Company's derivative contracts are determined based
on  counterparties'  estimates and valuation models. The Company has not changed
its  valuation  method  during  2002.  During  2002,  the Company was a party to
forward foreign exchange  contracts,  commodity and interest rate swap contracts
and commodity collar  contracts.  See Note J of Notes to Consolidated  Financial
Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for
additional  information regarding the Company's derivative contracts,  including
deferred  gains and losses on  terminated  derivative  contracts.  The following
table  reconciles  the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Company's
open derivative contracts during 2002:


Quantitative Disclosures

       Interest rate sensitivity.  The following tables provide information,  in
U. S. dollar  equivalent  amounts,  about other financial  instruments  that the
Company  was a party to as of  December  31,  2002 and 2001 and that are or were
sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present
maturities  by  expected  maturity  dates  together  with the  weighted  average
interest rates expected to be paid on the debt, given current  contractual terms
and market  conditions.  For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate
represents  the  contractual  fixed  rates that the  Company  was  obligated  to
periodically pay on the debt as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. For variable rate
debt, the average  interest rate  represents the average rates being paid on the
debt  projected  forward  proportionate  to the  forward  yield  curves  for the
six-month London Interbank Offered Rate.








      The accompanying  Interest Rate  Sensitivity table as of December 31, 2001
also provides  information  about interest rate swap agreements that the Company
was a party  to as of that  date.  These  interest  rate  swap  agreements  were
terminated  during  the year ended  December  31,  2002 and no longer  represent
market risk to the Company. The interest rate swap agreements as of December 31,
2001 hedged (i) the fair value of the Company's 8-1/4 percent senior notes; (ii)
the fair value of the Company's 6-1/2 percent senior notes;  and (iii) a portion
of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's Credit Agreement.








       Foreign  exchange  rate   sensitivity.   The  following  tables   provide
information,  in U.S. dollar  equivalent  amounts,  about  derivative  financial
instruments that the Company was a party to as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and
that were sensitive to changes in foreign exchange rates.



       Commodity price sensitivity. The following tables provide information, in
U.S. dollar equivalent amounts,  about derivative financial instruments that the
Company was a party to as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and that were  sensitive
to changes in oil and gas prices.  As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  all of the
Company's derivative financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil
and gas prices qualified as hedges.

       Commodity hedge instruments. The Company hedges commodity price risk with
swap and collar  contracts.  Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional
amount of sales volumes.  Collar contracts provide minimum ("floor") and maximum
("ceiling")  prices  for the  Company  on a  notional  amount of sales  volumes,
thereby  allowing some price  participation  if the relevant  index price closes
above the floor price.

       See  Notes B, C and J  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
included  in  "Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for a
description of the  accounting  procedures  followed by the Company  relative to
hedge derivative financial  instruments and for specific  information  regarding
the terms of the Company's derivative  financial  instruments that are sensitive
to changes in oil and gas prices.

















Qualitative Disclosures

       Non-derivative  financial  instruments.  The Company is a  borrower under
fixed rate and variable  rate debt  instruments  that give rise to interest rate
risk. The Company's  objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is
to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing the Company's costs of capital.
To realize its  objectives,  the Company  borrows  under fixed and variable rate
debt  instruments,  based on the availability of capital,  market conditions and
hedge  opportunities.  See Note E of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements
included  in  "Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for a
discussion of the Company's debt instruments.

       Derivative financial  instruments.  The Company has,  from  time to time,
entered into interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative
contracts to hedge  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange rate and commodity  price
risks in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Company's board
of directors.  In accordance with those policies and  guidelines,  the Company's
executive  management  determines  the  appropriate  timing  and extent of hedge
transactions.  Although the Company is a party to certain  derivative  contracts
that do not qualify for hedge accounting  treatment,  the Company's policy is to
limit its participation in derivative contracts to those that, in the opinion of
management, reduce the Company's overall economic risk.

       As of December 31, 2002,  the Company's primary risk exposures associated
with  financial  instruments  to which it is a party  include  oil and gas price
volatility,  volatility  in the  exchange  rates  of  the  Canadian  dollar  and
Argentine  peso vis a vis the U.S.  dollar and  interest  rate  volatility.  The
Company's primary risk exposures associated with financial  instruments have not
changed significantly since December 31, 2002.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Pioneer Natural Resources Company:

       We have audited  the accompanying consolidated  balance sheets of Pioneer
Natural  Resources  Company as of December  31,  2002 and 2001,  and the related
consolidated  statements of  operations,  stockholders'  equity,  cash flows and
comprehensive  income  (loss) for each of the three  years in the  period  ended
December 31, 2002.  These  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

       We conducted  our audits in  accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

       In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Pioneer  Natural  Resources  Company  at  December  31,  2002 and 2001,  and the
consolidated  results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended  December  31, 2002,  in  conformity  with  accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

       As discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements,  in 2001
Pioneer  Natural  Resources  Company adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  133,   "Accounting   for  Derivative   Instruments  and  Hedging
Activities".

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000


NOTE A.     Organization and Nature of Operations

       Pioneer  Natural  Resources  Company   (the  "Company")   is  a  Delaware
corporation  whose  common  stock is listed  and  traded  on the New York  Stock
Exchange.  The Company is an oil and gas exploration and production company with
ownership  interests  in oil and gas  properties  located in the United  States,
Argentina, Canada, South Africa, Gabon and Tunisia.

NOTE B.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

       Principles  of  consolidation.   The  consolidated  financial  statements
include the  accounts of the Company  and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  since
their acquisition or formation, and the Company's interest in the affiliated oil
and gas  partnerships  for which it serves as general partner through certain of
its wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  The Company  proportionately  consolidates less
than 100  percent-owned  oil and gas  partnerships  in accordance  with industry
practice.  The Company  owns less than a 20 percent  interest in the oil and gas
partnerships that it  proportionately  consolidates.  All material  intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

       Investments  in non-affiliated  equity  securities  that  have  a readily
determinable  fair value are classified as "trading  securities" if management's
current intent is to hold them for only a short period of time; otherwise,  they
are accounted for as  "available-for-sale"  securities.  The Company reevaluates
the  classification of investments in  non-affiliated  equity securities at each
balance   sheet   date.   The   carrying   value  of  trading   securities   and
available-for-sale  securities  are  adjusted  to fair value as of each  balance
sheet date.

       Unrealized  holding  gains  are  recognized  for  trading  securities  in
interest and other  revenue,  and  unrealized  holding  losses are recognized in
other  expense  during the periods in which  changes in fair value occur.  As of
December 31, 2002, the Company had $.2 million of trading securities recorded to
other  assets.  The  Company  had no  investments  in trading  securities  as of
December 31, 2001.

       Unrealized holding gains and losses are recognized for available-for-sale
securities as credits or charges to stockholders' equity and other comprehensive
income (loss) during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.  Realized
gains  and  losses  on the  divestiture  of  available-for-sale  securities  are
determined  using  the  average  cost  method.  The  Company  did not  have  any
investments in available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2002 or 2001.

       Investments  in  non-affiliated  equity  securities  that  do not  have a
readily determinable fair value are measured at the lower of their original cost
or the net  realizable  value of the  investment.  The  Company did not have any
equity security  investments that did not have a readily determinable fair value
as of December 31, 2002 or 2001.

       Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements.  Preparation
of  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  the
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting  periods.  Depletion of oil and gas  properties  is  determined  using
estimates  of proved  oil and gas  reserves.  There are  numerous  uncertainties
inherent  in  the  estimation  of  quantities  of  proved  reserves  and  in the
projection  of  future  rates  of  production  and  the  timing  of  development
expenditures.  Similarly,  evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil
and gas  properties  are  subject to  numerous  uncertainties  including,  among
others,  estimates of future  recoverable  reserves;  commodity  price outlooks;
foreign laws,  restrictions  and currency  exchange rates; and export and excise
taxes.

       Early  in  January  2002,  the  Argentine  government  severed the direct
one-to-one U.S. dollar to Argentine peso  relationship that had existed for many
years.   The  following   bullet  points  disclose  the  significant   Argentine
assumptions  utilized  in  the  preparation  of  the  2002  and  2001  financial
statements:






                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000



o    As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  the Company used exchange  rates of 3.37
     pesos  to  $1  and  1.7  pesos  to  $1,  respectively,   to  remeasure  the
     peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of the Company's Argentine
     subsidiaries.

o    As part  of the  December  31,  2001  remeasurement  process,  the  Company
     estimated  that  the  recovery  or  settlement  values  to be  realized  on
     pre-devaluation,   peso-denominated   receivables  and  payables  would  be
     approximately 1.2 pesos to $1.

o    After  remeasuring  inventory at  historical  exchange  rates,  the Company
     reduced the carrying  value of its  Argentine  lease and well  equipment to
     market  values.  The market value of the  inventory  was estimated to be 15
     percent  higher  than the  historical  peso  balance,  but  lower  than the
     Company's  carrying cost on an equivalent  U.S. dollar basis as of December
     31, 2001.

o    The Company  reviewed  its  Argentine  proved and unproved  properties  for
     impairment as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. The Company's assessments were
     based on the  Company's  expectations  of  future  commodity  prices  to be
     received  and  expenses  to be paid in  Argentina.  The  December  31, 2002
     assumptions utilized to determine future net cash flows had oil and natural
     gas liquids  ("NGLs")  prices at world  market  prices  adjusted for export
     taxes and local  market  discounts.  Gas prices  were  assumed to return to
     predevaluation  U.S.  dollar  levels  after a period  of time to allow  for
     inflation.  Expenses  were  initially  assumed to be equivalent to reported
     expenses  in 2002,  but to  gradually  increase  to 15  percent  above 2002
     levels.  Based upon these  assumptions,  the  Company  determined  that the
     carrying value of its proved and unproved properties was fully recoverable.

       The remeasurement of  the  peso-denominated  monetary  net  assets of the
Company's Argentine subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 resulted in the Company
recognizing  a  $6.9  million   charge  during  2002.   The  December  31,  2001
remeasurement of the Company's Argentine subsidiaries' peso-denominated monetary
net assets and the  adjustment to reduce the  subsidiaries'  carrying  values of
lease and well  equipment  inventory  to market  values  resulted in the Company
recognizing  a  $7.7  million  charge  in  2001.  Numerous  uncertainties  exist
surrounding  the ultimate  resolution  of  Argentina's  economic  and  political
instability and actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions
utilized.

       The Argentine  economic and  political situation  continues to evolve and
the Argentine  government may enact future  regulations  or policies that,  when
finalized  and  adopted,  may  materially  impact,  among other  items,  (i) the
realized prices the Company  receives for the commodities it produces and sells;
(ii) the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the Company's  corporate
headquarters  in the United States;  (iii) the Company's asset  valuations;  and
(iv) peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.

       New accounting pronouncements. During June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No.
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 amends
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 19, "Financial  Accounting and
Reporting by Oil and Gas  Producing  Companies"  ("SFAS 19") to require that the
fair value of a liability  for an asset  retirement  obligation be recognized in
the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made.  Under  the  provisions  of SFAS 143,  asset  retirement  obligations  are
capitalized  as part of the carrying value of the  long-lived  asset.  Under the
provisions  of SFAS 19, asset  retirement  obligations  are  recognized  using a
cost-accumulation  approach.  The Company  currently  records  significant asset
retirement  obligations through the  unit-of-production  method, except for such
liabilities that were assumed in business  combinations,  which were recorded at
their  estimated fair values.  The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on
January 1, 2003.

       The adoption of SFAS 143  resulted in a January 1, 2003 cumulative effect
adjustment  to record (i) a $13.8  million  increase in the  carrying  values of
proved  properties,  (ii) a $26.3 million decrease in accumulated  depreciation,
depletion,





                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000


and amortization of property, plant and equipment, (iii) a $1.0 million increase
in  current  abandonment  liabilities  and  (iv) a  $22.4  million  increase  in
noncurrent abandonment liabilities. The net impact of items (i) through (iv) was
to record a gain of $16.7 million, net of tax, as a cumulative effect adjustment
of a change in accounting principle in the Company's consolidated  statements of
operations upon adoption on January 1, 2003.

       During April 2002,  the FASB  issued  Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of
FASB  Statement No. 13 and  Technical  Corrections"  ("SFAS 145").  Prior to the
adoption  of  the  provisions  of  SFAS  145,  gains  or  losses  on  the  early
extinguishment  of debt were required to be  classified in a company's  periodic
consolidated  statements of operations as extraordinary  gains or losses, net of
associated  income  taxes,  after  the  determination  of  income  or loss  from
continuing  operations.  SFAS 145  requires,  except  in the case of  events  or
transactions of a highly unusual and infrequent nature, gains or losses from the
early  extinguishment  of debt to be  classified  as  components  of a company's
income or loss from continuing operations. The Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS 145 on January 1, 2003.  The adoption of the  provisions of SFAS 145 is not
expected to affect the Company's  future financial  position or liquidity.  Upon
adoption  of the  provisions  of SFAS  145,  gains  or  losses  from  the  early
extinguishment  of debt recognized in the Company's  consolidated  statements of
operations  for the  years  ended  December  31,  2002,  2001 and  2000  will be
reclassified   to  other   revenues  or  other   expense  and  included  in  the
determination of the income (loss) from continuing operations of those periods.

       Cash equivalents.  Cash  and cash  equivalents  include  cash on hand and
depository accounts held by banks.

       Inventories - equipment.  Lease and well  equipment to be  used in future
production  and drilling  activities are carried at the lower of cost or market,
on a first-in,  first-out  basis.  The Company has established  lower of cost or
market allowances to reduce the carrying values of its equipment  inventories in
the amounts of $3.6  million and $6.8  million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

       Inventories - commodities.  Commodities  are  carried  at  the  lower  of
average cost or market.  When sold from inventory,  commodities are removed on a
first-in, first-out basis.

       Oil and gas properties.  The  Company  utilizes  the  successful  efforts
method of  accounting  for its oil and gas  properties.  Under this method,  all
costs associated with productive wells and  nonproductive  development wells are
capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological and geophysical
expenditures  are expensed.  The Company also expenses the costs associated with
exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves if a determination  that proved
reserves have been found cannot be made within one year of the exploration  well
being drilled.  The Company capitalizes interest on expenditures for significant
development projects until such projects are ready for their intended use.

       The Company  owns interests  in 11 natural gas processing plants and five
treating  facilities.  The  Company  operates  seven of the  plants and all five
treating  facilities.  The  Company's  ownership  in the natural gas  processing
plants  and  treating  facilities  is  primarily  to  accommodate  handling  the
Company's gas  production and thus are considered a component of the capital and
operating costs of the respective  fields that they service.  To the extent that
there is excess capacity at a plant or treating  facility,  the Company attempts
to  process  third  party gas  volumes  for a fee to keep the plant or  treating
facility at capacity.  All  revenues  and expenses  derived from third party gas
volumes  processed  through the plants and treating  facilities  are reported as
components of oil and gas production  costs. The third party revenues  generated
from the plant and treating  facilities  for the three years ended  December 31,
2002,  2001 and 2000 were  $28.4  million,  $32.7  million  and  $36.3  million,
respectively.  The third party expenses  attributable to the plants and treating
facilities  for those same  periods  were $9.3  million,  $9.7  million and $9.0
million,  respectively.  The  capitalized  costs  of  the  plants  and  treating
facilities  are included in proved oil and gas properties and are depleted using
the unit-of-production   method along  with the other  capitalized  costs of the
field that they service.






                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000


       Capitalized  costs  relating  to proved properties are depleted using the
unit-of-production  method  based  on  proved  reserves.  Costs  of  significant
nonproducing  properties,  wells in the process of being drilled and development
projects are excluded from depletion  until such time as the related  project is
completed and proved reserves are established or, if unsuccessful, impairment is
determined.

       Capitalized costs of individual  properties sold or abandoned are charged
to accumulated  depletion,  depreciation and amortization with the proceeds from
the sales of individual  properties  credited to property costs. No gain or loss
is recognized until the entire amortization base is sold. However,  gain or loss
is  recognized  from the sale of less  than an entire  amortization  base if the
disposition is significant enough to materially impact the depletion rate of the
remaining properties in the amortization base.

       If significant,  the Company accrues the  estimated future  costs to plug
and abandon wells under the unit-of-production   method.  The charge, if any, is
reflected  in  the  accompanying   Consolidated   Statements  of  Operations  as
abandonment  expense  while  the  liability  is  reflected  in the  accompanying
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets as other  liabilities.  Plugging  and  abandonment
liabilities  assumed in a business  combination  accounted for as a purchase are
recorded  at fair  value.  At  December  31,  2002 and  2001,  the  Company  has
recognized  plugging  and  abandonment  liabilities  of $34.7  million and $39.5
million,  respectively.  See "New accounting pronouncements" for a discussion of
the  provisions  of SFAS 143 that will be adopted  by the  Company on January 1,
2003.

       The Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used,  including
proved oil and gas properties  accounted for under the successful efforts method
of accounting, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of those assets may not be  recoverable.  An impairment loss is indicated if the
sum of the expected  future cash flows is less than the  carrying  amount of the
assets. In this circumstance,  the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the
amount by which the  carrying  amount of the asset  exceeds the  estimated  fair
value of the asset.

       Unproved  oil and gas  properties that  are individually  significant are
periodically  assessed for impairment by comparing their cost to their estimated
value on a  project-by-project  basis.  The  estimated  value is affected by the
results of exploration  activities,  commodity  price  outlooks,  planned future
sales or  expiration  of all or a portion of such  projects.  If the quantity of
potential  reserves  determined by such  evaluations  is not sufficient to fully
recover  the cost  invested  in each  project,  the Company  will  recognize  an
impairment loss at that time by recording an allowance.  The remaining  unproved
oil and gas  properties,  if  any,  are  aggregated  and an  overall  impairment
allowance is provided based on the Company's historical experience.

       Treasury stock.  Treasury  stock  purchases are  recorded  at cost.  Upon
reissuance,  the cost of treasury shares held is reduced by the average purchase
price per share of the aggregate treasury shares held.

       Environmental.  The Company's environmental  expenditures are expensed or
capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate
to an  existing  condition  caused  by past  operations  and that have no future
economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend the life of the related
property  or  mitigate  or  prevent  future   environmental   contamination  are
capitalized.  Liabilities  are recorded  when  environmental  assessment  and/or
remediation  is  probable  and  the  costs  can be  reasonably  estimated.  Such
liabilities  are  undiscounted  unless  the  timing  of  cash  payments  for the
liability are fixed or reliably determinable.

       Revenue  recognition.   The  Company  uses  the  entitlements  method  of
accounting  for oil,  NGL and gas  revenues.  Sales  proceeds  in  excess of the
Company's  entitlement are included in other liabilities and the Company's share
of sales  taken by  others  is  included  in other  assets  in the  accompanying
Consolidated   Balance  Sheets.  The  following  table  presents  the  Company's
entitlement  assets and entitlement  liabilities and their associated volumes as
of December 31, 2002 and 2001 (in millions):

                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000



       Derivatives and hedging. Prior to January 1, 2001, the following criteria
were  required to be met in order for the  Company to account  for a  derivative
instrument  as a hedge of an existing  asset or  liability,  or of a  forecasted
transaction:  an asset,  liability or forecasted  transaction  must have existed
that exposed the Company to price,  interest rate or foreign  exchange rate risk
that was not offset in another asset or  liability;  the  derivative  instrument
must have reduced that price,  interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk; and,
the derivative  instrument must have been designated as a hedge at the inception
of the instrument and  throughout  the hedge period.  Additionally,  in order to
qualify as a hedge,  there must have been clear  correlation  between changes in
the fair value or expected cash flows of the derivative  instrument and the fair
value or expected  cash flows of the hedged asset or  liability,  or  forecasted
transaction, such that changes in the derivative instrument offset the effect of
price, interest rate or foreign exchange rate changes on the exposed items.

       Prior to January 1,  2001,  gains  or  losses  realized  from  derivative
instruments  that  qualified  as hedges were  deferred as assets or  liabilities
until the underlying hedged asset, liability or transaction  monetized,  matured
or was otherwise recognized under generally accepted accounting principles. When
recognized  in net income  (loss),  hedge  gains and losses were  classified  as
components of the commodity prices,  interest or foreign exchange rates that the
derivative instrument hedged.  Derivative  instruments that were not hedges were
recorded at fair value, as assets or liabilities.  Changes in the fair values of
non-hedge  derivative  instruments  were  recognized  as other  income  or other
expense during the periods in which their fair values changed.

       In June 1998,  the Financial Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  133,   "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments and Hedging  Activities" ("SFAS 133") as amended,  the provisions of
which the Company adopted effective January 1, 2001.

       SFAS  133   requires  the   accounting  recognition   of  all  derivative
instruments  as  either  assets  or   liabilities  at  fair  value.   Derivative
instruments  that are not hedges  must be  adjusted  to fair value  through  net
income (loss).  Under the  provisions of SFAS 133,  changes in the fair value of
derivative  instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in
the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities,  or firm commitments,  through
net income (loss). Effective changes in the fair value of derivative instruments
that are cash flow hedges are  recognized  in  Accumulated  other  comprehensive
income ("AOCI") - deferred hedge gains, net in the stockholders'  equity section
of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets until such time as the hedged items
are  recognized  in net income  (loss).  Ineffective  portions  of a  derivative
instrument's  change in fair  value are  immediately  recognized  in net  income
(loss).

       The  adoption  of  SFAS 133  resulted  in a  January 1,  2001  transition
adjustment  to (i)  reclassify  $57.8  million of deferred  losses on terminated
hedge  positions  from other assets  (including  $11.6  million of other current
assets),  (ii)  increase  other current  assets,  other assets and other current
liabilities by $7.0 million, $6.2 million and $146.6 million,  respectively,  to
record the fair value of open hedge  derivatives,  (iii)  increase  the carrying
value of hedged  long-term  debt by $6.2  million and (iv) reduce  stockholders'
equity by $197.4  million for the net impact of items (i) through  (iii)  above.
The  $197.4  million  reduction  in  stockholders'  equity  was  reflected  as a
transition adjustment in other comprehensive income (loss) on January 1, 2001.

       Under the provisions of SFAS 133,  the Company may designate a derivative
instrument as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a
liability or an identified  portion thereof that is attributable to a particular
risk (a "fair  value  hedge") or as  hedging  the  exposure  to  variability  in
expected future cash flows that are  attributable to a particular risk  (a "cash

flow hedge").  Both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing  basis, a fair
value hedge must be  expected to be highly  effective  in  achieving  offsetting
changes in fair value  attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a
hedge is designated.  Similarly, a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly
effective in achieving  offsetting  cash flows  attributable  to the hedged risk
during the term of the hedge.  The  expectation of hedge  effectiveness  must be
supported  by matching the  essential  terms of the hedged  asset,  liability or
forecasted  transaction  to the derivative  hedge  contract or by  effectiveness
assessments  using statistical  measurements.  The Company's policy is to assess
actual hedge effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter.

       See  Note  J  for  a  description  of  the  specific  types of derivative
transactions in which the Company participates.

       Stock-based compensation. The Company has a long-term incentive plan (the
"Long-Term   Incentive  Plan")  under  which  the  Company  grants   stock-based
compensation.  The Long-Term  Incentive  Plan is described more fully in Note G.
The Company  accounts for stock-based  compensation  granted under the Long-Term
Incentive  Plan  using the  intrinsic  value  method  prescribed  by  Accounting
Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees"
("APB 25") and related  interpretations.  Stock-based compensation expenses were
not  recognized  in net  income,  as all  options  granted  under the  Long-Term
Incentive  Plan had exercise  prices equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the dates of grant.  The following table  illustrates the effect
on net income and  earnings  per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition  provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation"  ("SFAS 123") to stock-based employee
compensation:


     Foreign currency translation.  The  U.S.  dollar is the functional currency
for all of the Company's  international  operations except Canada.  Accordingly,
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured
to U.S.  dollars  at the  exchange  rate in effect at the end of each  reporting
period;  revenues and costs and expenses  denominated in a foreign  currency are
remeasured  at the average of the exchange  rates that were in effect during the
period  in which  the  revenues  and costs and  expenses  were  recognized.  The
resulting gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency denominated balances
into U.S.  dollars are recorded in other income or other expense,  respectively.
Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in a foreign  currency  are
remeasured at the historic exchange rates that were in effect when the assets or
liabilities were acquired or incurred.

     The  functional  currency  of the  Company's  Canadian  operations  is  the
Canadian dollar. The financial  statements of the Company's Canadian  subsidiary
entities are translated to U. S. dollars as follows:  all assets and liabilities
are  translated  using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each  reporting
period;  revenues and costs and expenses are translated using the average of the
exchange  rates that were in effect  during the period in which the revenues and
costs  and  expenses  were  recognized.  The  resulting  gains  or  losses  from
translating non-U.S. dollar denominated balances are

       Reclassifications.  Certain reclassifications have  been made to the 2001
and 2000 amounts to conform to the 2002 presentation.

NOTE C.     Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

       The following  table  presents  the  carrying amounts  and estimated fair
values of the Company's financial instruments as of December 31, 2002 and 2001:


       Cash and cash  equivalents,  accounts receivable,  other current  assets,
accounts payable,  interest payable and other current liabilities.  The carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

       Commodity  price swap  and collar  contracts,  interest  rate  swaps  and
foreign  currency  swap  contracts.  The fair value of commodity  price swap and
collar  contracts,  interest  rate  swaps and  foreign  currency  contracts  are
estimated  from  quotes  provided  by the  counterparties  to  these  derivative
contracts and  represent the estimated  amounts that the Company would expect to
receive  or pay to  settle  the  derivative  contracts.  During  the year  ended
December 31, 2002, the Company terminated all of its interest rate swaps and the
Company's foreign currency  contracts  matured.  See Note J for a description of
each of these derivatives,  including whether the derivative  contract qualifies
for  hedge  accounting  treatment  or is  considered  a  speculative  derivative
contract.

                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000


       Financial assets.  As of December 31, 2002, the Company had an investment
in bonds that were classified as trading  securities and a note receivable.  The
Company  divested the bonds  during  January  2003.  The fair value of the 5-1/2
percent note  receivable  was  determined  based on  underlying  market rates of
interest.

       Long-term debt.  The carrying amount  of borrowings outstanding under the
Company's  corporate  credit  facility  approximates  fair value  because  these
instruments  bear interest at variable market rates.  The fair values of each of
the senior note issuances were determined based on quoted market prices for each
of the issues.  See Note E for  additional  information  regarding the Company's
long-term debt.

NOTE D.     Acquisitions

       Falcon acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
purchased,  through two transactions,  an additional 30 percent working interest
in the Falcon field  development and a 25 percent working interest in associated
acreage in the deepwater  Gulf of Mexico for a combined  purchase price of $61.1
million.  As a result  of these  transactions,  the  Company  owns a 75  percent
working  interest  in and  operates  the Falcon  field  development  and related
exploration blocks.

       West Panhandle acquisitions.  During July 2002, the Company completed the
purchase  of the  remaining  23 percent of the rights  that the  Company did not
already own in its core area West  Panhandle gas field,  100 percent of the West
Panhandle  reserves  attributable to field fuel, 100 percent of the related West
Panhandle  field  gathering  system and ten  blocks  surrounding  the  Company's
deepwater   Gulf  of  Mexico  Falcon   discovery.   In  connection   with  these
transactions,  the  Company  recorded  $100.4  million  to  proved  oil  and gas
properties,  $3.8 million to unproved oil and gas properties and $1.9 million to
assets held for resale;  retired a capital cost  obligation  for $60.8  million;
settled  a  $20.9   million  gas   balancing   receivable;   assumed  trade  and
environmental  obligations amounting to $5.8 million in the aggregate;  and paid
$140.2 million of cash. The capital cost  obligation  retired by the Company for
$60.8 million  represented  an obligation  for West  Panhandle gas field capital
additions that was not able to be prepaid and bore interest at an annual rate of
20 percent. The portion of the purchase price allocated to the retirement of the
capital cost  obligation  was based on a discounted  cash flow analysis  using a
market  discount  rate for  obligations  with  similar  terms.  The capital cost
obligation had a carrying value of $45.2 million,  resulting in an extraordinary
loss of $15.6 million from the early extinguishment of this obligation.

       Affiliated partnership mergers.  During 2001,  the limited partners of 42
of the  Company's  affiliated  partnerships  approved an  agreement  and plan of
merger ("Plan of Merger") among the Company, Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc.
("Pioneer USA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the partnerships.
The Plan of Merger was  accounted  for as a purchase  business  combination.  In
consideration for the  partnerships'  net assets,  the limited partners received
5.7 million shares of the Company's  common stock valued at $18.35 per share. In
connection with this  transaction,  the Company recorded $92.9 million to proved
oil and gas  properties,  $13.6  million  to cash and $.3  million  to other net
assets.  The cash  acquired from the  partnerships,  net of $2.5 million of cash
transaction  costs, is included in "cash acquired in  acquisitions,  net of fees
paid" in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statement  of Cash  Flows for the year
ended  December  31,  2001.  Except  for the  cash  acquired,  this  transaction
represents  a noncash  investing  activity of the Company that was funded by the
issuance of common stock.

       During 2000,  the Company  received the  approval  of the  partners of 13
employee  partnerships  to merge with  Pioneer USA for a purchase  price of $2.0
million.  Of the  total  purchase  price,  $317  thousand  was  paid to  Company
employees.  Additionally,  during 2000, the Company  purchased all of the direct
oil and gas  interests  held by the  Company's  Chairman  of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer for $195 thousand.

       Other acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2002,  in addition
to the Falcon and West  Panhandle  acquisitions  referred to above,  the Company
spent  approximately $25.5 million to acquire additional unproved acreage in the
United States,  including 34 Gulf of Mexico shelf blocks,  six deepwater Gulf of
Mexico blocks, a 70 percent

working  interest  in ten state  leases on  Alaska's  North  Slope and  property
interests in other areas of the United  States.  Also during  2002,  the Company
acquired  unproved and proved oil and gas  property  interests in Canada for 2.3
million and $.5 million,  respectively,  and $1.8 million of additional unproved
property  interests in Tunisia.  During 2001, the Company spent $77.9 million to
acquire  additional  working  interests  in the  United  States  Gulf of  Mexico
Aconcagua discovery,  the related Canyon Express gathering system and the Devils
Tower  project;  21  deepwater  Gulf of  Mexico  blocks;  250,000  acres  in the
Anticlinal Campamento,  Dos Hermanas and La Calera areas of the Neuquen Basin in
Argentina; and a 30 percent interest in the Anaguid permit in the Ghadames basin
onshore  Southern  Tunisia.  During  2000,  the Company  spent $65.0  million to
acquire  additional  working  interests  in the  United  States  Gulf of  Mexico
discovery at Devils Tower and the Chinchaga gas field in Canada,  an interest in
the Camden  Hills  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico  discovery  and the Canyon  Express
gathering system.

NOTE E.     Long-term Debt

       Long-term debt, including the effects of fair value hedges and discounts,
consisted of the following components at December 31, 2002 and 2001:


       Maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2002 are as follows (in
thousands):


       Line of credit.  During  May 2000,  the  Company  entered  into a  $575.0
million corporate credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndication of
banks (the  "Banks")  that matures on March 1, 2005.  Advances  under the Credit
Agreement bear interest, at the option of the Company,  based on (a) a base rate
equal to the higher of the Bank of  America,  N.A.  prime rate (4.25  percent at
December  31,  2002) or a rate per annum  based on the  weighted  average of the
rates on  overnight  Federal  funds  transactions  with  members of the  Federal
Reserve System (1.16 percent at December 31, 2002), plus 50 basis points; plus a
eurodollar  margin  (the  "Eurodollar  Margin")  less 125  basis  points,  (b) a
Eurodollar  rate,  substantially  equal to the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate
("LIBOR")  (1.38  percent at December  31, 2002 for 90 day  borrowings),  plus a
Eurodollar Margin, or (c) a fixed rate (for aggregate advances not exceeding $50
million)  as quoted by the Banks  pursuant  to a  request  by the  Company.  The
Eurodollar  Margin is based on a grid of the Company's  debt rating and ratio of
total  debt to  earnings  before  gain or loss  on the  disposition  of  assets;
interest  expense;  income  taxes;  depreciation,   depletion  and  amortization
expense;  exploration  and  abandonment  expense and other  noncash  charges and
expenses (the "Total Leverage  Ratio").  As of December 31, 2002, the Eurodollar
Margin was 137.5 basis points.

                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000


       The  Credit  Agreement  imposes  certain  restrictive  covenants  on  the
Company,  including the maintenance of a Total Leverage Ratio not to exceed 3.75
to  1.00;  maintenance  of an  annual  ratio  of the net  present  value  of the
Company's  oil and gas  properties  to total  debt of at least  1.25 to 1.00;  a
limitation on the Company's total debt; and,  restrictions on certain  payments.
The Company was in compliance  with all of its debt covenants as of December 31,
2002.

       As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had $27.2 million and $27.9
million  of  undrawn  letters  of  credit  issued  under the  Credit  Agreement,
respectively,  and unused Credit Agreement  borrowing capacity of $287.8 million
and $253.1 million, respectively.

       Senior  notes.   The   Company's  senior  notes  are  general   unsecured
obligations  ranking equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured
indebtedness  of the Company and are senior in right of payment to all  existing
and future  subordinated  indebtedness of the Company.  The Company is a holding
company that conducts all of its operations through subsidiaries;  consequently,
the senior notes issuances are  structurally  subordinated to all obligations of
its   subsidiaries.   Interest  on  the   Company's   senior  notes  is  payable
semiannually.  Pioneer USA has fully and  unconditionally  guaranteed the senior
note  issuances.  See Note R for a discussion of Pioneer USA debt guarantees and
Consolidating Financial Statements.

       During  April 2002,  the Company  issued $150.0  million of 7-1/2 percent
senior notes due April 15, 2012 (the "7-1/2  percent senior  notes").  The 7-1/2
percent  senior  notes  were  issued at a price  equal to 100  percent  of their
principal amount and resulted in net proceeds to the Company, after underwriting
discounts,  commissions  and  costs of  issuance,  of  $146.7  million.  The net
proceeds from the issuance of the 7-1/2 percent senior notes were used to reduce
outstanding  borrowings  under the Credit  Agreement.  The 7-1/2 percent  senior
notes and 9-5/8 percent  senior notes  contain  various  restrictive  covenants,
including restrictions on the incurrence of additional  indebtedness and certain
payments defined within the associated indenture. The Company in compliance with
all of its senior note covenants as of December 31, 2002.

       Early extinguishment of debt and capital cost obligation. During the year
ended  December  31,  2002,  the  Company   repurchased  $47.1  million  of  its
outstanding  9-5/8 percent senior notes,  $13.9 million of its outstanding 8-7/8
percent  senior notes and repaid a $45.2 million  capital cost  obligation.  The
Company recognized extraordinary losses, net of taxes, of $6.7 million and $15.6
million associated with these debt extinguishments, respectively. See Note D for
additional  information  regarding the capital cost  obligation  that was repaid
during the year ended December 31, 2002.

       During  2001,  the  Company  redeemed  the  remaining  $22.5  million  of
outstanding 11-5/8 percent senior  subordinated  discount notes and $6.8 million
of outstanding  10-5/8  percent senior  subordinated  notes.  Additionally,  the
Company repurchased $38.7 million of its 9-5/8 percent senior notes during 2001.
Associated  with  these  debt   extinguishments,   the  Company   recognized  an
extraordinary loss, net of taxes, of $3.8 million during the year ended December
31, 2001.

       In  May 2000,  the Company  recognized an  extraordinary  loss  of  $12.3
million, net of tax, from the early extinguishment of its prior revolving credit
facility.

       See Note B for a discussion of the classification of gains  and losses on
the early extinguishment of debt after the adoption of SFAS 145 on January 1,
2003.

       Interest expense. The following amounts have been incurred and charged to
interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000:

NOTE F.     Related Party Transactions

       Activities  with  affiliated  partnerships.  Prior to 1992,  the Company,
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, sponsored 44 drilling partnerships, three
public income partnerships and 13 affiliated employee partnerships, all of which
were  formed  primarily  for the  purpose of drilling  and  completing  wells or
acquiring producing properties. During 2001, the Company completed the merger of
42 of the limited  partnerships  into  Pioneer  USA.  During  2000,  the Company
completed the merger of the 13 employee  partnerships into Pioneer USA. See Note
D for additional information regarding the mergers.

       During 1994,  1993 and  1992,  the  Company  formed a  Direct  Investment
Partnership  for the purpose of  permitting  selected  key  employees  to invest
directly,  on an unpromoted  basis,  in wells that the Company  drilled in those
years.  In  November  2000,  the  Company  exercised  its right under the Direct
Investment  Partnership  agreements to purchase each partner's interest in their
respective  Direct  Investment  Partnership.  The Company  paid $4.3  million to
complete the purchase, of which $887 thousand was paid to Company employees.

       The Company,  through a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  serves as operator of
properties  in  which  it and its  affiliated  partnerships  have  an  interest.
Accordingly,  the  Company  receives  producing  well  overhead,  drilling  well
overhead  and  other  fees  related  to the  operation  of the  properties.  The
affiliated  partnerships also reimburse the Company for their allocated share of
general and administrative charges.

       The  activities with  affiliated  partnerships  are  summarized  for  the
following related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000:

       Deferred compensation retirement plan.  In August 1997,  the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors approved a deferred compensation  retirement
plan for the officers and certain key employees of the Company. Each officer and
key employee is allowed to contribute up to 25 percent of their base salary. The
Company  will  then  provide  a  matching  contribution  of 100  percent  of the
officer's and key employee's contribution limited to the first 10 percent of the
officer's base salary and eight percent of the key employee's  base salary.  The
Company's matching contribution vests

immediately.  A trust fund has been established by the Company to accumulate the
contributions   made  under  this  retirement   plan.  The  Company's   matching
contributions were $805 thousand, $652 thousand and $611 thousand for 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

       401(k) plan.  The Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. 401(k) and Matching
Plan (the "401(k) Plan") is a defined  contribution  plan established  under the
Internal  Revenue  Code Section 401. The 401(k) Plan was formed by the merger of
the Pioneer  Natural  Resources  USA, Inc.  401(k) Plan and the Pioneer  Natural
Resources USA, Inc.  Matching Plan on January 1, 2002. All regular full-time and
part-time  employees  of Pioneer USA are eligible to  participate  in the 401(k)
Plan on the first day of the month  following  their date of hire.  Participants
may  contribute  an amount of not less than two percent nor more than 12 percent
of their annual salary into the 401(k) Plan. Matching  contributions are made to
the 401(k)  Plan in cash by Pioneer  USA in  amounts  equal to 200  percent of a
participant's  contributions  to the 401(k)  Plan that are not in excess of five
percent of the participant's  basic compensation (the "Matching  Contribution").
Each  participant's  account is credited with the  participant's  contributions,
their Matching  Contributions  and  allocations  of the 401(k) Plan's  earnings.
Participants  are fully  vested in their  account  balances  except for Matching
Contributions and their proportionate share of 401(k) Plan earnings attributable
to Matching  Contributions,  which  proportionately vest over a four year period
that begins with the participant's date of hire. During the years ended December
31, 2002,  2001 and 2000, the Company  recognized  compensation  expense of $4.1
million,  $3.4 million and $3.4 million,  respectively,  as a result of Matching
Contributions.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

       In  August  1997,  the  Company's  stockholders  approved  the  Long-Term
Incentive Plan,  which provides for the granting of incentive awards in the form
of stock options,  stock appreciation  rights,  performance units and restricted
stock to  directors,  officers  and  employees  of the  Company.  The  Long-Term
Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum number of shares of common
stock  equal to 10  percent  of the total  number  of  shares  of  common  stock
equivalents  outstanding less the total number of shares of common stock subject
to outstanding awards under any stock-based  plan for the directors, officers or
employees of the Company.

       The following table calculates the number of shares or  options available
for grant under the Company's  Long-Term Incentive Plan as of  December 31, 2002
and 2001:


       Stock option awards.  The Company has  a program of  awarding semi-annual
stock options to its officers and employees and gives its non-employee directors
a choice to receive (i) 100 percent  restricted  stock,  (ii) 100 percent  stock
options,  (iii) 100 percent cash, or (iv) a combination  of 50/50 of any two, as
their annual  compensation.  This program provides for stock option awards at an
exercise price based upon the closing sales price of the Company's  common stock
on the day prior to the date of grant. Employee stock option awards vest over an
18 month or three year  schedule  and provide a five year  exercise  period from
each vesting date.  Non-employee  directors'  stock  options vest  quarterly and
provide for a five year  exercise  period from each  vesting  date.  The Company
granted 1,643,212; 1,627,071 and 1,439,035 options under the Long-Term Incentive
Plan during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

       Restricted stock awards.  During  the year  ended December 31, 2002,  the
Company  issued 654,445  restricted  shares of the Company's  common stock.  The
restricted  awards were issued as  compensation  to directors,  officers and key
employees of the Company. The restricted share awards include 18,545 shares that
were granted to directors  of the Company on May 13, 2002.  Director  awards for
3,302  shares vest on a quarterly  pro-rata  basis during the year ended May 13,
2003 and director  awards for 15,243 shares vest on May 13, 2005.  The remaining
635,900  restricted  shares were  awarded to officers  and key  employees of the
Company on August 12, 2002 and vest on August 12,  2005.  The  Company  recorded
$16.2 million of deferred  compensation in the  stockholder's  equity section of
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet associated with the restricted stock
awards,  which amount will be amortized to compensation expense over the vesting
periods of the awards. During the year ended December 31, 2002,  amortization of
the restricted stock awards increased the Company's compensation expense by $1.9
million.

       The following table reflects the  outstanding restricted stock awards and
activity related thereto for 2002:


      There were no restricted stock awards to directors or employees during the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

       Other stock based plans.  Prior to the  formation of the Company in 1997,
the Company's  predecessor companies had long-term incentive plans in place that
allowed the  predecessor  companies  to grant  incentive  awards  similar to the
provisions of the Long-Term  Incentive Plan. Upon formation of the Company,  all
awards under these plans were assumed by the Company with the provision  that no
additional awards be granted under the predecessor plans.

       SFAS  123  disclosures.    The  Company  applies   APB  25  and   related
interpretations  in  accounting  for its stock option  awards.  Accordingly,  no
compensation  expense  has been  recognized  for its  stock  option  awards.  If
compensation expense for the stock option awards had been determined  consistent
with SFAS 123, the Company's net income and net income per share would have been
less than reported amounts.  See Note B comparisons of net income and net income
per share as reported and as adjusted for the pro forma  effects of  determining
compensation expense in accordance with SFAS 123.

       Under SFAS 123, the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on
the date of grant   using  the  Black-Scholes   option  pricing  model  with the
following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000:

       The following  table  summarizes  information  about the  Company's stock
options outstanding at December 31, 2002:


Employee Stock Purchase Plan

       The Company has an Employee Stock  Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") that allows
eligible  employees  to  annually  purchase  the  Company's  common  stock  at a
discounted price. Officers of the Company are not eligible to participate in the
ESPP.  Contributions  to the ESPP are limited to 15 percent of an employee's pay
(subject  to  certain  ESPP  limits)  during  the nine  month  offering  period.
Participants in the ESPP purchase the Company's  common stock at a price that is
15 percent below the closing sales price of the Company's common stock on either
the first day or the last day of each annual offering period,  whichever closing
sales price is lower.

NOTE H.     Issuance of Common Stock

       During  April 2002,  the  Company  completed a  public  offering of  11.5
million  shares of its common stock at $21.50 per share.  Associated  therewith,
the  Company  received  $236.0  million  of net  proceeds  after the  payment of
issuance  costs.  The Company used the net proceeds from the public  offering to
fund  the  acquisition  of the  Falcon  assets  and  associated  acreage  in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the West Panhandle gas field acquisitions. See Note
D for information regarding these acquisitions.

NOTE I.     Commitments and Contingencies

       Severance agreements.  The Company has  entered into severance agreements
with its  officers,  subsidiary  company  officers  and certain  key  employees.
Salaries  and bonuses for the  Company's  officers  are set by the  Compensation
Committee for the parent company  officers and by the  Management  Committee for
subsidiary  company  officers  and key  employees.  These  committees  can grant
increases or reductions to base salary at their  discretion.  The current annual
salaries for the parent company  officers,  the subsidiary  company officers and
key employees covered under such agreements total approximately $18.2 million.

       Indemnifications.  The Company has  indemnified its directors and certain
of its officers, employees and agents with respect to claims and damages arising
from  acts or  omissions  taken in such  capacity,  as well as with  respect  to
certain litigation.

       Legal actions.  The Company is  party to various legal actions incidental
to its business, including, but not limited to, the proceedings described below.
The majority of these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising from
oil and gas leases and ownership  interest  disputes.  The Company believes that
the ultimate disposition of these legal actions will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's  consolidated  financial  position,  liquidity,  capital
resources or future results of operations. The Company will continue to evaluate
its  litigation  matters  on a  quarter-by-quarter   basis  and will  adjust its
litigation  reserves  as  appropriate  to  reflect  the then  current  status of
litigation.

       Alford.  The Company is party to a 1993 class action lawsuit filed in the
26th Judicial District Court of Stevens County, Kansas by two classes of royalty
owners,  one for  each  of the  Company's  gathering  systems  connected  to the
Company's Satanta gas plant. The case was relatively inactive for several years.
In early 2000, the plaintiffs  amended their  pleadings to add claims  regarding
the field  compression  installed by the Company in the 1990's.  The lawsuit now
has two material claims.  First, the plaintiffs assert that the expenses related
to the field  compression are a "cost of production" for which plaintiffs cannot
be charged their  proportionate  share under the  applicable oil and gas leases.
Second,  the  plaintiffs  claim they are entitled to 100 percent of the value of
the helium extracted at the Company's  Satanta gas plant. If the plaintiffs were
to prevail on the above two claims in their  entirety,  it is possible  that the
Company's liability could reach $25 million, plus prejudgment interest. However,
the Company believes it has valid defenses to plaintiffs'  claims,  has paid the
plaintiffs  properly under their  respective oil and gas leases,  and intends to
vigorously defend itself.

       The Company  believes the cost of the field compression is not a "cost of
production",  but is rather an expense of transporting  the gas to the Company's
Satanta gas plant for processing,  where valuable hydrocarbon liquids and helium
are extracted from the gas. The plaintiffs benefit from such extractions and the
Company believes that charging the plaintiffs with their  proportionate share of
such  transportation and processing  expenses is consistent with Kansas law. The
Company has also vigorously  defended against  plaintiffs' claims to 100 percent
of the value of the helium  extracted,  and  believes  that in  accordance  with
applicable law, it has properly accounted to the plaintiffs for their fractional
royalty  share  of  the  helium  under  the  specified  royalty  clauses  of the
respective oil and gas leases.

       The factual  evidence  in the  case  was  presented to  the 26th Judicial
District Court without a jury in December 2001. Oral arguments were heard by the
court in April 2002,  and  although  the court has not yet entered a judgment or
findings,  it could do so at any time. The Company strongly denies the existence
of any material  underpayment  to  plaintiffs  and believes it presented  strong
evidence at trial to support its  positions.  The Company has not yet determined
the  amount of  damages,  if any,  that  would be  payable  if the  lawsuit  was
determined  adversely  to the  Company.  Although  the  amount of any  resulting
liability  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  results of
operations  for the  quarterly  reporting  period  in which  such  liability  is
recorded,  the  Company  does not  expect  that any such  liability  will have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated  financial position as a whole or on
its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations.

       Kansas ad valorem tax. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ("NGPA") allows
a "severance,  production or similar" tax to be included as an add-on,  over and
above the maximum  lawful price for gas.  Based on a Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") ruling that Kansas ad valorem tax was such a tax, one of the
Company's  predecessor  entities collected the Kansas ad valorem tax in addition
to the otherwise  maximum  lawful  price.  The FERC's ruling was appealed to the
United  States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  ("D.C.  Circuit"),
which held in June 1988 that the FERC failed to provide a reasoned basis for its
findings and remanded the case to the FERC for further consideration.

       On December 1, 1993, the FERC issued an order reversing its prior ruling,
but  limiting  the effect of its  decision to Kansas ad valorem  taxes for sales
made on or after June 28, 1988.  The FERC  clarified the  effective  date of its
decision by an order dated May 18, 1994. The order  clarified that the effective
date applies to tax bills  rendered  after June 28,  1988,  not sales made on or
after that date. Numerous parties filed appeals on the FERC's action in the D.C.
Circuit.  Various gas producers challenged the FERC's orders on two grounds: (1)
that  the  Kansas  ad  valorem  tax,  properly  understood,   does  qualify  for
reimbursement  under the NGPA; and (2) the FERC's ruling  should,  in any event,
have been applied  prospectively.  Other parties challenged the FERC's orders on
the grounds that the FERC's  ruling  should have been applied  retroactively  to
December 1, 1978,  the date of the  enactment of the NGPA and  producers  should
have been required to pay refunds accordingly.

       The D.C. Circuit issued its decision on August 2,  1996, which holds that
producers  must make refunds of all Kansas ad valorem tax collected with respect
to production since October 4, 1983, as opposed to June 28, 1988.  Petitions for
rehearing  were denied on November 6, 1996.  Various gas producers  subsequently
filed a petition  for writ of  certiori  with the United  States  Supreme  Court
seeking to limit the scope of the potential  refunds to tax bills rendered on or
after  June 28,  1988 (the  effective  date  originally  selected  by the FERC).
Williams  Natural Gas Company  filed a  cross-petition  for certiori  seeking to
impose refund  liability back to December 1, 1978. Both petitions were denied on
May 12, 1997.

       The Company  and other  producers filed petitions for adjustment with the
FERC on June 24, 1997.  The Company was seeking waiver or set-off from FERC with
respect  to that  portion  of the  refund  associated  with  (i)  non-recoupable
royalties,  (ii)  non-recoupable  Kansas property taxes based, in part, upon the
higher prices  collected,  and (iii) interest for all periods.  On September 10,
1997,  FERC denied this request,  and on October 10, 1997, the Company and other
producers filed a request for rehearing. Pipelines were given until November 10,
1997 to file  claims on refunds  sought  from  producers  and  refunds  totaling
approximately $30.2 million were made against the Company.  Through December 31,
2002, the Company has settled $21.7 million of the original  claim  amounts,  of
which  $11.8  million  was  settled  during  2002.  The  carrying  value  of the
obligation  settled during 2002 exceeded the  settlement  paid by the Company by
$3.5 million.  Accordingly,  the Company recognized other income of $3.5 million
during 2002.  As of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001,  the Company had on
deposit  $10.6  million  and  $24.5  million,  respectively,  including  accrued
interest,  in an  escrow  account  and  had  corresponding  obligations  for the
remaining  claims  recorded in other  current  liabilities  in the  accompanying
Consolidated  Balance Sheets.  The Company  believes that the escrowed  amounts,
plus accrued interest, will be sufficient to settle the remaining claims.

       Lease agreements.  The  Company  leases  offshore  production facilities,
equipment and office facilities under  noncancellable  operating leases on which
rental  expense  for the  years  ended  December  31,  2002,  2001  and 2000 was
approximately $6.7 million, $6.6 million and $7.0 million, respectively.  Future
minimum lease commitments under noncancellable  operating leases at December 31,
2002 are as follows (in thousands):

       Transportation agreements. The Company's wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary
is a party to pipeline  transportation service agreements,  with remaining terms
of  approximately  13 years,  whereby it has  committed to transport a specified
volume of gas each year from  Canada to a point in Chicago,  Illinois.  Such gas
volumes are  comprised of a significant  portion of the  Company's  Canadian net
production, augmented with certain volumes purchased at market prices in Canada.
The  committed  volumes  to be  transported  under the  pipeline  transportation
service  agreements  are  approximately  84 MMcf of gas per day during  2003 and
decline  to  approximately  80 MMcf of gas per day by the end of the  commitment
term.  The net gas marketing  gains or losses  resulting from  purchasing  third
party gas in Canada and  selling it in Chicago are  recorded as other  income or
other  expense  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations.
Associated with these agreements,  the Company  recognized $2.6 million and $9.9
million  of gas  marketing  losses  in other  expenses  during  2002  and  2001,
respectively.

NOTE J.     Derivative Financial Instruments

Hedge Derivatives

       The Company,  from time to time,  uses  derivative  instruments to manage
interest rate, commodity price and currency exchange rate risks.

       Fair value hedges.  The Company  monitors  capital  markets and trends to
identify  opportunities  to enter into interest rate swaps to minimize its costs
of capital.  As of December  31,  2002,  the Company was not a party to any fair
value hedges.  As of December 31, 2001, the carrying value of the Company's fair
value hedges was a liability of $19.6 million.

       During  April 2000 and  May 2001,  the Company entered into interest rate
swap  agreements to hedge the fair value of the Company's  8-7/8 percent  senior
notes and 8-1/4 percent  senior notes,  respectively.  The terms of the interest
rate swap agreements  matched the notional  amounts and scheduled  maturities of
the  bonds;  required  the  counterparties  to pay the  Company  a fixed  annual
interest rate equal to the stated bond coupon rates on the notional amounts; and
required the Company to pay the counterparties variable annual interest rates on
the  notional  amounts  equal to the  periodic  six-month  LIBOR  plus  weighted
average  margin  rates of 178.2 basis points and 238.1 basis points on the 8-7/8
percent  senior  notes and 8-1/4  percent  senior  notes;  respectively.  During
September  2001,  the Company  terminated  its 8-7/8  percent and 8-1/4  percent
interest  rate  swaps for $23.3  million  of cash  proceeds,  including  accrued
interest.

       During April 2002  the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements
to hedge the fair value of the Company's  8-7/8 percent senior notes and, during
November 2001, the Company  entered into interest rate swap  agreements to hedge
the fair value of its 6-1/2 percent senior notes and 8-1/4 percent senior notes.
The terms of the interest rate swap agreements  matched the notional amounts and
scheduled  maturities  of the  bonds;  required  the  counterparties  to pay the
Company fixed annual interest rates equal to the stated bond coupon rates on the
notional amounts;  and required the Company to pay the  counterparties  variable
annual  interest rates on the notional  amounts equal to the periodic  six-month
LIBOR plus  weighted  average  margin  rates of 397 basis  points,  202.2  basis
points,  and 337 basis points on the 8-7/8 percent  senior notes,  6-1/2 percent
senior notes and 8-1/4 percent  senior  notes;  respectively.  During  September
2002, the Company terminated these interest rate swaps for $36.3 million of cash
proceeds, including accrued interest.

       As of December 31,  2002,  the carrying  value of the Company's long-term
debt in the accompanying  Consolidated  Balance Sheets included $35.7 million of
incremental  liability  attributable  to the  unamortized  deferred  hedge gains
realized  from the  terminations  of the Company's  fair value hedge  agreements
during 2002 and 2001. The amortization of these deferred hedge gains reduced the
Company's reported interest expense by $14.1 million and $2.8 million during the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

       The following  table sets  forth the  scheduled  amortization of deferred
hedge  gains  on  terminated  fair  value  hedges  that  will be  recognized  as
reductions in the Company's future interest expense:




      The terms of the  fair value hedges  described above perfectly matched the
terms of the  underlying  senior  notes.  Thus,  the Company did not exclude any
component  of the  derivatives'  gains or losses from the  measurement  of hedge
effectiveness.

       Cash flow hedges. The Company utilizes, from time to time, commodity swap
and  collar  contracts  to (i)  reduce  the  effect of price  volatility  on the
commodities the Company  produces and sells,  (ii) support the Company's  annual
capital  budgeting and expenditure  plans and (iii) reduce  commodity price risk
associated with certain capital projects. The Company has also utilized interest
rate swap  agreements  to reduce the effect of interest  rate  volatility on the
Company's  variable  rate  line of  credit  indebtedness  and  forward  currency
exchange  agreements  to reduce the  effect of U.S.  dollar to  Canadian  dollar
exchange rate volatility.

       Oil.  All material sales contracts governing the Company's oil production
have  been tied  directly  or  indirectly  to the New York  Mercantile  Exchange
prices.  The  following  table sets forth the  Company's  outstanding  oil hedge
contracts  and the  weighted  average  NYMEX  prices for those  contracts  as of
December 31, 2002:


       The Company  reports average oil  prices per Bbl including the effects of
oil quality  adjustments  and the net effect of oil hedges.  The following table
sets forth the Company's oil prices, both reported (including hedge results) and
realized  (excluding  hedge  results),  and the net effect of settlements of oil
price hedges to revenue:

        Natural gas liquids prices.   During the years ended  December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, the Company did not enter into any NGL hedge contracts.

       Gas prices.  The Company employs a policy of hedging a portion of its gas
production based on the index price upon which the gas is actually sold in order
to mitigate the basis risk between  NYMEX  prices and actual index  prices.  The
following table sets forth the Company's outstanding gas hedge contracts and the
weighted average index prices for those contracts as of December 31, 2002:


       The Company reports  average gas  prices per Mcf including the effects of
Btu content, gas processing and shrinkage  adjustments and the net effect of gas
hedges.  The following table sets forth the Company's gas prices,  both reported
(including hedge results) and realized  (excluding  hedge results),  and the net
effect of settlements of gas price hedges to revenue:


        Interest rates.  During the year  ended  December 31, 2001,  the Company
entered into interest rate swap agreements and designated the swap agreements as
being cash flow hedges of the interest rate volatility associated with a portion
of the  Company's  variable rate line of credit  indebtedness.  The terms of the
interest rate swap agreements  provided for an aggregate  notional amount of $55
million of debt; commenced on May 21, 2001 and matured on May 20, 2002; required
the  counterparties  to pay the  Company a variable  rate equal to the  periodic
six-month  LIBOR plus 125 basis  points;  and,  required  the Company to pay the
counterparties  a weighted  average  annual rate of 5.43 percent on the notional
amount.  The  Company  recognized  interest  expense of $447  thousand  and $185
thousand  associated with these interest rate swap  agreements  during the years
ended  December  31,  2002 and 2001,  respectively.  The Company  recognized  no
ineffectiveness  associated with changes in the fair values of these  derivative

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000


        Foreign currency rates.  During 2001,  the Company  entered into forward
agreements  to exchange an aggregate  $24.8  million  U.S.  dollars for Canadian
dollars at a  weighted  average  exchange  rate of .6266  U.S.  dollars  for 1.0
Canadian  dollar.  These  agreements  were designated as hedges of the Company's
exchange  rate risk  associated  with  Canadian  sales of gas under U.S.  dollar
denominated sales agreements.  The Company  recognized  settlement gains of $249
thousand associated with these forward agreements during the year ended December
31, 2002, which increased the Company's  reported gas price. The Company did not
recognize  any  ineffectiveness  associated  with  changes in the fair values of
these derivative instruments.  Except for one forward agreement that represented
an asset of $15 thousand to the Company on December 31, 2002,  these  agreements
matured during the year ended December 31, 2002.

        Hedge  ineffectiveness  and  excluded  items.  During  the  years  ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized other expense of $1.7 million
and $9.1 million, respectively,  related to the ineffective portions of its cash
flow hedging instruments.  Additionally, based on SFAS 133 interpretive guidance
that  was in  effect  prior  to  April  2001,  the  Company  excluded  from  the
measurement  of hedge  effectiveness  changes in the time and  volatility  value
components  of  collar  contracts  designated  as cash flow  hedges.  Associated
therewith,  the Company  recorded other expense of $2.4 million during the three
month period ended March 31, 2001. In April 2001, the Company  discontinued  the
exclusion  of  time  value  and  volatility   from  the   measurement  of  hedge
effectiveness.

        Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income -  deferred  hedge  gains  and
losses,  net. As described in Note B, the Company records the effective portions
of  deferred  cash flow hedge gains and losses in AOCI - deferred  hedge  gains,
net. Once the underlying  hedged  transaction  occurs the deferred hedge gain or
loss is reclassified from AOCI - deferred hedge gains, net to earnings. If it is
determined that the underlying  hedged  transaction is not likely to occur,  the
deferred  hedge gain or loss is  reclassified  from AOCI - deferred hedge gains,
net to other income or other expense during the period in which it is determined
that the underlying  hedged  transaction is not likely to occur.  As of December
31, 2002 and 2001,  AOCI - deferred hedge gains,  net  represented  net deferred
gains of $9.6  million  and $201.0  million,  respectively.  The AOCI - deferred
hedge gains, net balance as of December 31, 2002 was comprised of $107.8 million
of unrealized  deferred hedge losses on the effective portions of open commodity
cash flow hedges and $117.4  million of net deferred  gains on  terminated  cash
flow hedges.  The AOCI - deferred  hedge  gains,  net balance as of December 31,
2001 was  comprised  of  $177.7  million  of  unrealized  deferred  gains on the
effective  portions of open commodity,  interest rate and forward  currency rate
cash flow hedges and $23.3 million of net deferred gains on terminated cash flow
hedges.  The decrease in AOCI - deferred hedge gains,  net during the year ended
December 31, 2002 was primarily  attributable  to increases in future  commodity
prices relative to the commodity  prices  stipulated in the hedge agreements and
the  reclassification  of  deferred  hedge  gains to net  income as  derivatives
matured  by  their  terms.  The  unrealized  deferred  hedge  gains  and  losses
associated   with  open  cash  flow  hedges  remain   subject  to  market  price
fluctuations until the positions are either settled under the terms of the hedge
agreements or terminated prior to settlement.  The net deferred gains and losses
on terminated cash flow hedges are fixed.

        During the twelve month  period ending  December 31,  2003,  the Company
expects to reclassify $73.6 million of net deferred losses  associated with open
cash flow hedges and $72.1 million of net deferred gains on terminated cash flow
hedges from AOCI - deferred hedge gains, net to oil and gas revenue.

        The following  table  sets  forth  the  scheduled  reclassifications  of
deferred  hedge gains on terminated  cash flow hedges that will be recognized in
the Company's future oil and gas revenues:

                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000



Non-hedge Derivatives

       Btu swap agreements.  The Company is a  party to Btu swap agreements that
mature at the end of 2004.  The Btu swap  agreements  do not  qualify  for hedge
accounting  treatment.  The  Company  recorded  mark-to-market   adjustments  to
decrease the carrying  value of the Btu swap liability by $.7 million during the
year ended  December 31, 2001 and to increase the carrying value of the Btu swap
liability by $14.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2000.

       During  the year  ended  December 31,  2001,  the  Company  entered  into
offsetting Btu swap  agreements that fixed the Company's  remaining  obligations
associated with the Btu swap  agreements.  The  undiscounted  future  settlement
obligations  of the Company under the Btu swap  agreements  are $7.2 million per
year for each of 2003 and 2004.

       Foreign currency agreements. Prior to their maturity in 2000, the Company
was a party to a series of forward  foreign  exchange rate swap  agreements that
exchanged Canadian dollars for U.S. dollars.  These contracts did not qualify as
hedges.  The  Company  recorded a  mark-to-market  adjustment  to  increase  the
carrying value of the foreign  exchange swap  liabilities by $1.9 million during
the year ended December 31, 2000.

       Other non-hedge commodity derivatives. During the year ended December 31,
1999, the Company sold call options that provided the  counterparties  an option
to exercise  calls  either on 10,000  Bbls per day of oil, at a strike  price of
$20.00 per Bbl, or on 100,000 MMBtu per day of gas, at a weighted average strike
price of $2.75 per MMBtu.  These contracts,  which matured during the year ended
December 31, 2000, did not qualify for hedge accounting  treatment.  The Company
recorded  mark-to-market  adjustments  to  increase  the  carrying  value of the
associated  contract  liability by $42.0 million  during the year ended December
31, 2000.

NOTE K.     Major Customers and Derivative Counterparties

       Sales to major customers.  The Company's  share of oil and gas production
is sold to various  purchasers.  The Company is of the opinion  that the loss of
any one purchaser would not have an adverse effect on the ability of the Company
to sell its oil and gas production.

       The following customers individually  accounted for 10 percent or more of
the consolidated oil,  NGL and gas revenues of the Company during one or more of
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000:

       At December 31,  2002,  the  amounts  receivable  from  Williams  Energy
Services  and  Anadarko  Petroleum  Corporation  were  $13.4  million  and $11.7
million, respectively,  which are included in the caption "Accounts receivable -
trade" in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.

       Derivative counterparties.  The Company uses  credit and  other financial
criteria to evaluate the credit  standing of, and to select,  counterparties  to
its derivative  instruments.  Although the Company does not obtain collateral or
otherwise secure the fair value of its derivative instruments, associated credit
risk is mitigated by the Company's  credit risk policies and  procedures.  As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001,  the Company has $7.6 million of  derivative  assets
for which Enron North  America Corp was the Company's  counterparty.  Associated
therewith,  the  Company  recognized  bad debt  expense of $.4  million and $6.0
million during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  which
amounts  are  included  in  other  expense  in  the  accompanying   Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

completed asset divestitures for net proceeds of $118.9 million,  $113.5 million

during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

and 2001,  the Company  terminated,  prior to their  scheduled  maturity,  hedge
derivatives  for  cash  sales  proceeds  of $91.3  million  and  $85.4  million,
respectively.  Net gains from these  divestitures  were  deferred  and are being
amortized  over the original  contract  lives of the  terminated  derivatives as
reductions to interest expense or increases to oil and gas revenues.  See Note J
for more information regarding deferred gains on terminated hedge derivatives.

       Available  for  sale  securities  divestitures.  During  the  year  ended
December  31,  2000,  the Company  sold  3,370,982  shares of common  stock of a

       The following  table  provides  the  components  of the  Company's  other

NOTE O.     Income Taxes

       The Company accounts  for income  taxes in accordance with the provisions
of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes".  The Company and its eligible  subsidiaries  file a consolidated  United
States federal income tax return.  Certain  subsidiaries  are not eligible to be
included  in the  consolidated  United  States  federal  income  tax  return and
separate  provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities or
groups of entities. The tax returns and the amount of taxable income or loss are
subject to  examination  by United  States  federal,  state and  foreign  taxing
authorities.  Current and estimated tax payments of $2.3 million,  $11.7 million
and $4.6  million were made during the years ended  December 31, 2002,  2001 and
2000, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the
Company's income tax provision  (benefit) and amounts separately  allocated were
attributable to the following items:

       Realization of  deferred tax  assets  associated  with net operating loss
carryforwards   ("NOLs")  and  other  credit  carryforwards  is  dependent  upon
generating  sufficient  taxable  income prior to their  expiration.  The Company
believes  that  there is a risk that  certain  of these  NOLs and  other  credit
carryforwards may expire unused and,  accordingly,  has a valuation allowance of
$277.2  million  against  the  carryforwards  at  December  31,  2002.  Although
realization  is not assured for the  remaining  deferred tax asset,  the Company
believes it is more likely  than not that they will be realized  through  future
taxable  earnings or  alternative  tax  planning  strategies.  However,  the net
deferred  tax assets  could be  reduced  further if the  Company's  estimate  of
taxable income in future  periods is  significantly  reduced or alternative  tax
planning strategies are no longer viable.

       At December 31,  2002,  the Company had NOLs for United States, Canadian,
South  African,  Gabonese  and Tunisian  income tax purposes of $742.7  million,
$37.4  million,  $40.3  million,  $13.4 million and $8.7 million,  respectively,
which are available to offset future regular  taxable income in each  respective
tax jurisdiction,  if any.  Additionally,  at December 31, 2002, the Company has
alternative  minimum tax net operating  loss  carryforwards  ("AMT NOLs") in the
United  States  of  $637.5  million,   which  are  available  to  reduce  future
alternative  minimum  taxable  income,  if any.  These  carryforwards  expire as
follows:


       The Company  believes $160.0  million of  the U.S.  NOLs and AMT NOLs are
subject to Section  382 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code and are  limited in each
taxable year to approximately $20.0 million.

NOTE P.    Geographic Operating Segment Information

       The Company has operations  in only one industry segment,  that being the
oil and gas  exploration  and  production  industry;  however,  the  Company  is
organizationally structured along geographic operating segments, or regions. The
Company has reportable  operations in the United  States,  Argentina and Canada.
Other foreign is primarily  comprised of  operations in South Africa,  Gabon and
Tunisia.

       The following  table  provides  the  geographic  operating  segment  data
required by Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 131,  "Disclosure
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information",  as well as results of
operations  of oil  and  gas  producing  activities  required  by  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting Standards No. 69, "Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing
Activities".  Geographic operating segment income tax benefits (provisions) have
been   determined   based  on  statutory  rates  existing  in  the  various  tax
jurisdictions  where  the  Company  has oil and gas  producing  activities.  The
"Headquarters and Other" table column includes revenues,  expenses, additions to
properties,  plants and equipment and assets that are not routinely  included in
the earnings  measures or  attributes  internally  reported to  management  on a
geographic operating segment basis.

NOTE Q.     Income Per Share Before Extraordinary Items

       Basic income per share before extraordinary items is computed by dividing
income  before  extraordinary  items by the  weighted  average  number of common
shares  outstanding for the period.  The computation of diluted income per share
before  extraordinary  items reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other  contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common  stock or resulted in the  issuance of common  stock that would then
share in the earnings of the Company.

       The following table is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted weighted
average common shares  outstanding  for the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001
and 2000:

Results of Operations

       Information  about the  Company's results  of  operations for oil and gas
producing  activities  is  presented  in  Note P of the  accompanying  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reserve Quantity Information

       The estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves as of December
31, 2002, which are located principally in the United States, Argentina, Canada,
South  Africa and  Tunisia,  were based on  evaluations  audited by  independent
petroleum  engineers with respect to the Company's major properties and prepared
by the Company's  engineers with respect to all other properties.  The estimates
of the  Company's  proved oil and gas  reserves as of December 31, 2001 and 2000
were prepared by the Company's engineers.  Reserves were estimated in accordance
with guidelines  established by the SEC and the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board,  which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic
and operating conditions with no provision for price and cost escalations except
by  contractual  arrangements.  The reserve  estimates  for 2002,  2001 and 2000
utilize  respective oil prices of $29.67,  $18.88 and $25.71 per Bbl (reflecting
adjustments for oil quality); respective NGL prices of $19.01, $11.58 and $16.74
per  Bbl;  and,  respective  gas  prices  of  $3.37,  $2.21  and  $7.50  per Mcf
(reflecting adjustments for Btu content, gas processing and shrinkage).

       Oil  and  gas   reserve  quantity   estimates  are  subject  to  numerous
uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in
the  projection  of future  rates of  production  and the timing of  development
expenditures.  The  accuracy of such  estimates  is a function of the quality of
available data and of engineering  and geological  interpretation  and judgment.
Results of subsequent  drilling,  testing and production may cause either upward
or downward revision of previous estimates.  Further,  the volumes considered to
be  commercially  recoverable  fluctuate  with  changes in prices and  operating
costs. The Company  emphasizes that reserve  estimates are inherently  imprecise
and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of currently
producing oil and gas properties.  Accordingly,  these estimates are expected to
change as additional information becomes available in the future.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

       The standardized  measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed
by applying year-end prices of oil and gas (with  consideration of price changes
only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to the estimated future
production of proved oil and gas reserves  less  estimated  future  expenditures
(based on year-end  costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved
reserves,  discounted  using a rate  of 10  percent  per  year  to  reflect  the
estimated timing of the future cash flows. Future income taxes are calculated by
comparing  undiscounted  future  cash  flows  to the  tax  basis  of oil and gas
properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying the current tax
rates to the difference.  The discounted  future net cash flows estimated in the
table  below do not  include  the  effects of the  Company's  commodity  hedging
contracts.  Utilizing December 31, 2002 commodity prices held constant over each
hedge  contract's  term, the net present value of the Company's  hedge contracts
discounted at 10 percent was a liability equal to approximately $226 million.

       Discounted  future cash  flow estimates  like those  shown  below are not
intended to  represent  estimates  of the fair value of oil and gas  properties.
Estimates  of fair value should also  consider  probable  reserves,  anticipated
future oil and gas prices, interest rates, changes in development and production
costs and risks  associated with future  production.  Because of these and other
considerations,  any  estimate  of fair  value  is  necessarily  subjective  and
imprecise.
