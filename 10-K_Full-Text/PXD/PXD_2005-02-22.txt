Definitions of Oil and Gas Terms and Conventions Used Herein

     Within this Report,  the following oil and gas terms and  conventions  have
specific meanings:

       o  "Bbl" means a standard barrel containing 42 United States gallons.
       o  "Bcf" means one billion cubic feet.
       o  "BOE" means a  barrel of  oil equivalent and is a  standard convention
          used to  express oil  and gas  volumes on  a comparable oil equivalent
          basis.  Gas equivalents  are  determined  under  the  relative  energy
          content method by  using the ratio of 6.0 Mcf of gas to 1.0 Bbl of oil
          or NGL.
       o  "Btu" means  British thermal  unit and  is a measure  of the amount of
          energy required to raise  the temperature  of one  pound of  water one
          degree Fahrenheit.
       o  "GAAP" means accounting  principles that are generally accepted in the
          United States.
       o  "LIBOR" means London Interbank Offered Rate, which is a market rate of
          interest.
       o  "MBbl" means one thousand Bbls.

       o  "NGL" means natural gas liquid.
       o  "NYMEX" means The New York Mercantile Exchange.
       o  "NYSE" means The New York Stock Exchange.
       o  "Pioneer" or the "Company" means Pioneer Natural Resources Company and
          its subsidiaries.
       o  "Proved reserves" mean the estimated quantities of crude oil,  natural
          gas,  and natural  gas liquids  which geological  and engineering data
          demonstrate with  reasonable  certainty  to be  recoverable  in future
          years from known  reservoirs  under  existing  economic and  operating
          conditions,  i.e.,  prices and  costs as  of the  date the estimate is
          made.  Prices  include  consideration of  changes in  existing  prices
          provided  only by  contractual  arrangements,  but not on  escalations
          based upon future conditions.
                (i) Reservoirs are  considered proved if  economic producibility
           is  supported by  either actual  production or  conclusive  formation
           test.  The area  of a  reservoir  considered proved includes (A) that
           portion  delineated  by   drilling  and  defined  by  gas-oil  and/or
           oil-water  contacts,  if  any;  and  (B)  the  immediately  adjoining
           portions not  yet drilled,  but which  can be  reasonably  judged  as
           economically  productive on  the basis  of available  geological  and
           engineering data.  In the absence of  information on fluid  contacts,
           the lowest  known structural occurrence of  hydrocarbons controls the
           lower proved limit of the reservoir.
                (ii) Reserves  which   can  be  produced   economically  through
           application of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection)
           are included in the "proved"  classification when  successful testing
           by a pilot project,  or the operation  of an installed program in the
           reservoir, provides support for the engineering analysis on which the
           project or program was based.
                (iii) Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following:
           (A) oil that  may  become  available  from  known  reservoirs  but is
           classified  separately as "indicated  additional reserves"; (B) crude
           oil, natural gas,  and natural gas liquids,  the recovery of which is
           subject to  reasonable doubt  because of  uncertainty  as to geology,
           reservoir  characteristics,  or  economic  factors;  (C)  crude  oil,
           natural gas,  and  natural gas liquids,  that may  occur in undrilled
           prospects; and (D) crude oil,  natural gas, and natural  gas liquids,
           that may be recovered from oil shales, coal, gilsonite and other such
           sources.
       o   "SEC" means the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
       o   "Standardized Measure" means the after-tax present value of estimated
           future net revenues of proved reserves, determined in accordance with
           the  rules  and regulations  of the SEC,  using prices  and costs  in
           effect at the specified date and a 10 percent discount rate.
       o   With  respect  to  information  on the  working  interest  in  wells,
           drilling  locations and acreage,  "net" wells, drilling locations and
           acres are determined by multiplying "gross" wells, drilling locations
           and acres by the  Company's working interest in such wells,  drilling
           locations or  acres.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  wells,  drilling
           locations and acreage statistics quoted herein represent gross wells,
           drilling locations or acres.
       o   Unless otherwise  indicated,  all currency  amounts are  expressed in
           U.S. dollars.









                                     PART I


ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

General

     Pioneer is a Delaware  corporation  whose common stock is listed and traded
on the NYSE.  The Company is a large  independent  oil and gas  exploration  and
production  company with  operations in the United  States,  Argentina,  Canada,
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, South Africa and Tunisia.

     The  Company's  executive  offices are located at 5205 N.  O'Connor  Blvd.,
Suite  900,  Irving,  Texas  75039.  The  Company's  telephone  number  is (972)

with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

Evergreen Merger

     On  September  28,  2004,  Pioneer  completed  its  merger  with  Evergreen
Resources,  Inc.  ("Evergreen").  Pioneer acquired the common stock of Evergreen
for a total purchase price of approximately $1.8 billion, which was comprised of
cash and Pioneer common stock. At the merger date,  Evergreen's  proved reserves
were  262.2  MMBOE.  Evergreen  was a  publicly-traded  independent  oil and gas
company  primarily  engaged  in the  production,  development,  exploration  and
acquisition of North American unconventional natural gas. Evergreen was based in
Denver,  Colorado  and was one of the  leading  developers  of coal bed  methane
reserves in the United States.  Evergreen's  operations were principally focused
on  developing  and  expanding  its coal bed methane  field located in the Raton
Basin in southern Colorado.  Evergreen also had operations in the Piceance Basin
in western  Colorado,  the Uinta Basin in eastern  Utah and the  Western  Canada
Sedimentary  Basin.  See Note C of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
included  in "Item 8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for more
information regarding the Evergreen merger.

Mission and Strategies

     The Company's mission is to provide  shareholders with superior  investment
returns through strategies that maximize Pioneer's  long-term  profitability and
net asset value. The strategies  employed to achieve this mission are predicated
on  maintaining  financial   flexibility  and  capital  allocation   discipline.
Historically,  these  strategies have been anchored by the Company's  long-lived
Spraberry  oil field and Hugoton and West  Panhandle  gas fields'  reserves  and
production.  Since the fourth  quarter of 2004, the strategy is also enhanced by
the newly acquired Raton gas field. Underlying these fields are approximately 75
percent of the  Company's  proved oil and gas  reserves as of December 31, 2004.
These fields have a remaining  productive life in excess of 40 years. The stable
base of oil and gas  production  from these fields,  combined with the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico Canyon Express, Falcon area and Devils Tower projects which began
production in September  2002,  March 2003 and May 2004,  respectively,  and the







Sable oil  discovery  in South  Africa  which began  production  in August 2003,
should  generate the operating  cash flows to fund the Company's $900 million to
$950 million  capital  budget for 2005 and allow the Company to further  enhance
its financial flexibility during 2005.

     During 2004, the Company  utilized  capital from its long-lived  Spraberry,
Hugoton and West  Panhandle  fields and  shorter-lived  deepwater Gulf of Mexico
projects to partially fund the merger with Evergreen and to selectively reinvest
in assets that the Company  believes  will offer  superior  investment  returns.
Similarly,  during 2005, the Company will continue to: (i)  selectively  explore
for and develop proved reserve  discoveries in areas that it believes will offer
superior reserve growth and profitability potential; (ii) evaluate opportunities
to acquire oil and gas properties under terms that will complement the Company's
exploration and development drilling  activities;  (iii) invest in the personnel
and technology  necessary to maximize the Company's  exploration and development
successes; and (iv) enhance liquidity, allowing the Company to take advantage of
future exploration,  development and acquisition  opportunities.  The Company is
committed  to  continuing  to enhance  shareholder  investment  returns  through
adherence to these strategies.

Business Activities

     The  Company  is an  independent  oil and gas  exploration  and  production
company.  Pioneer's  purpose is to  competitively  and  profitably  explore for,
develop and produce oil, NGL and gas  reserves.  In so doing,  the Company sells
homogenous  oil, NGL and gas units which,  except for  geographic and relatively
minor qualitative  differentials,  cannot be significantly  differentiated  from
units offered for sale by the Company's  competitors.  Competitive  advantage is
gained in the oil and gas exploration and development  industry through superior
capital  investment  decisions,  technological  innovation  and  price  and cost
management.

     Petroleum industry. The petroleum industry has generally been characterized
by rising oil, NGL and gas commodity prices during 2004 and recent years. During
2004, the Company has also been affected by increasing  costs,  particularly the
cost of steel and higher drilling and well servicing rig rates. World oil prices
have  increased in response to political  unrest and supply  disruptions in Iraq
and Venezuela while North American gas prices have improved as supply and demand
fundamentals  have  strengthened.  Significant  factors  that will  impact  2005
commodity prices include the final resolution of issues currently impacting Iraq
and the Middle East in general,  the extent to which members of the Organization
of Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  ("OPEC") and other oil exporting nations are
able to continue to manage oil supply  through  export  quotas and overall North
American gas supply and demand fundamentals. To mitigate the impact of commodity
price volatility on the Company's net asset value,  Pioneer  utilizes  commodity
hedge contracts.  See "Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About
Market Risk" and Note K of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included
in "Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for  information
regarding the impact to oil and gas revenues during the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 from the Company's hedging activities and the Company's open
hedge positions at December 31, 2004.

     The Company.  The  Company's  asset base is anchored by the  Spraberry  oil
field located in West Texas, the Hugoton gas field located in Southwest  Kansas,
the Raton gas field  located in southern  Colorado  and the West  Panhandle  gas
field located in the Texas Panhandle. Complementing these areas, the Company has
exploration  and  development   opportunities  and/or  oil  and  gas  production
activities in the Gulf of Mexico, the onshore Gulf Coast area and in Alaska, and
internationally in Argentina, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, South Africa and
Tunisia.   Combined,   these  assets   create  a  portfolio  of  resources   and
opportunities  that are well balanced among oil, NGLs and gas, and that are also
well balanced  between  long-lived,  dependable  production and  exploration and
development  opportunities.  Additionally,  the Company has a team of  dedicated
employees that  represent the  professional  disciplines  and sciences that will
allow  Pioneer to  maximize  the  long-term  profitability  and net asset  value
inherent in its physical assets.

     The Company provides  administrative,  financial and management  support to
United  States and foreign  subsidiaries  that explore for,  develop and produce
oil,  NGL  and gas  reserves.  Production  operations  are  principally  located
domestically in Texas, Kansas,  Colorado,  Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, and
internationally in Argentina, Canada, South Africa and Tunisia.

     Production.  The Company focuses its efforts towards maximizing its average
daily production of oil, NGLs and gas through development  drilling,  production
enhancement activities and acquisitions of producing properties while minimizing
the  controllable  costs associated with the production  activities.  During the









year ended December 31, 2004, the Company's average daily  production,  on a BOE
basis,  increased  as a result of (i) gas  production  beginning in January 2004
from the Company's  Harrier gas field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,  (ii) oil
production  beginning in May 2004 from the  Company's  Devils Tower oil field in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,  (iii) gas production  beginning in June 2004 from
the Company's  Raptor and Tomahawk gas fields in the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico,
(iv) a full  year of gas  production  from  the  Company's  Falcon  field in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico,  (v) a full year of oil production  from the Company's
Adam field in Tunisia,  (vi) a full year of oil  production  from the  Company's
Sable field offshore South Africa, (vii) increased production from Argentina and
(viii) fourth  quarter  production  from the  properties  added in the Evergreen
merger. These increases more than offset normal production declines.  During the
year ended  December  31, 2003,  the  Company's  average  daily oil, NGL and gas
production  increased as a result of (i) a full year of gas production  from the
Company's  Canyon Express gas project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,  (ii) gas
production  beginning in March 2003 from the  Company's  Falcon gas field in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico,  (iii) increased  production from Argentina  primarily
resulting from the resumption of oil drilling activities in the third quarter of
2002, (iv) oil production beginning in May 2003 from the Company's Adam field in
Tunisia and (v) oil production beginning in August 2003 from the Company's Sable
field offshore South Africa.  These increases more than offset normal production
declines.  During 2002, the Company's  average daily oil, NGL and gas production
decreased primarily due to normal production declines,  reduced Argentine demand
for gas, the Company's  curtailment of Argentine drilling  activities during the
first half of 2002 and the December  2001 sale of the  Company's  Rycroft/Spirit
River field in Canada.  Production,  price and cost  information with respect to
the Company's properties for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002 is set forth under "Item 2. Properties - Selected Oil and Gas Information -
Production, Price and Cost Data".

     Drilling  activities.  The  Company  seeks  to  increase  its  oil  and gas
reserves,  production and cash flow through exploratory and development drilling
and  by  conducting  other  production  enhancement  activities,  such  as  well
recompletions.  During the three  years ended  December  31,  2004,  the Company
drilled  1,035 gross  (876.8 net) wells,  87 percent of which were  successfully
completed as productive  wells,  at a total  drilling cost (net to the Company's
interest) of $1.6  billion.  During 2004,  the Company  drilled 423 gross (384.8
net) wells. The Company's current 2005 capital expenditure budget is expected to
range from $900 million to $950 million.  The Company has allocated the budgeted
2005 capital  expenditures as follows:  approximately  75 percent to development
drilling and facility  activities and the balance of approximately 25 percent to
exploration activities.

     The Company  believes that its current property base provides a substantial
inventory of prospects for future reserve,  production and cash flow growth. The
Company's  proved  reserves as of December 31, 2004 include  proved  undeveloped
reserves and proved  developed  reserves  that are behind pipe of 161.1 MMBOE of
oil and NGLs and 1,356.6 Bcf of gas.  Development of these proved  reserves will
require  future  capital  expenditures.  The timing of the  development of these
reserves will be dependent upon the commodity price  environment,  the Company's
expected operating cash flows and the Company's financial condition. The Company
believes that its current  portfolio of proved  reserves and unproved  prospects
provides attractive  development and exploration  opportunities for at least the
next three to five years.

     Exploratory  activities.  The Company has devoted  significant  efforts and
resources to hiring and developing a highly skilled exploration staff as well as
acquiring and drilling a portfolio of exploration  opportunities.  The Company's
commitment to exploration has resulted in significant  discoveries,  such as the
1998 Sable oil field discovery in South Africa; the 1999 Aconcagua,  2000 Devils
Tower,  2001 Falcon and 2003  Harrier,  Tomahawk and Raptor  discoveries  in the
deepwater  Gulf of Mexico;  and the 2002 Borj El Khadra permit  discovery in the
Ghadames basin onshore Southern Tunisia. The Company currently  anticipates that
its 2005  exploration  efforts  will be  approximately  25 percent of total 2005
capital expenditures and will be concentrated domestically in the Gulf of Mexico
and Alaska,  and  internationally in Africa,  Argentina and Canada.  Exploratory
drilling  involves  greater  risks of dry holes or  failure  to find  commercial
quantities  of  hydrocarbons  than  development  drilling or  enhanced  recovery
activities.  See "Item 1. Business - Risks Associated with Business Activities -
Drilling activities" below.

     Acquisition  activities.  The Company regularly seeks to acquire properties
that   complement  its   operations,   provide   exploration   and   development
opportunities  and  potentially  provide  superior  returns  on  investment.  In
addition, the Company pursues strategic acquisitions that will allow the Company
to expand into new  geographical  areas that feature  producing  properties  and
provide exploration/exploitation  opportunities. During the years ended December
31, 2004,  2003 and 2002,  the Company  expended  $2.6 billion  (including  $2.5
billion  associated  with the  Evergreen  merger),  $151.0  million  and  $195.5
million,  respectively,  of acquisition  capital to purchase  proved oil and gas









properties,  including  additional  interests  in its  existing  assets,  and to
acquire new prospects for future  exploitation and exploration  activities.  See
Note C of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in "Item 8.
Financial  Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the Company's
acquisitions during 2004, 2003 and 2002.

     The Company  periodically  evaluates and pursues acquisition  opportunities
(including opportunities to acquire particular oil and gas properties or related
assets;   entities  owning  oil  and  gas  properties  or  related  assets;  and
opportunities   to  engage  in  mergers,   consolidations   or  other   business
combinations  with such entities) and at any given time may be in various stages
of  evaluating  such  opportunities.  Such  stages may take the form of internal
financial analysis, oil and gas reserve analysis, due diligence,  the submission
of an indication of interest, preliminary negotiations,  negotiation of a letter
of intent or negotiation of a definitive agreement.

     Asset  divestitures.  The Company  regularly reviews its asset base for the
purpose of  identifying  non-strategic  assets,  the  disposition of which would
increase   capital   resources   available  for  other   activities  and  create
organizational  and operational  efficiencies.  While the Company generally does
not dispose of assets solely for the purpose of reducing debt, such dispositions
can  have the  result  of  furthering  the  Company's  objective  of  increasing
financial flexibility through reduced debt levels.

     During the years ended  December 31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  the  Company's
divestitures  consisted of the early  termination of derivative  hedge contracts
and the sales of oil and gas  properties  and other  assets for net  proceeds of
$1.7 million, $35.7 million and $118.9 million, respectively,  which resulted in
net  divestiture  gains  of  $39  thousand,   $1.3  million  and  $4.4  million,
respectively. The net cash proceeds were primarily used to fund additions to oil
and gas properties or to reduce the Company's outstanding indebtedness. See Note
O of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in "Item 8. Financial
Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for  specific  information  regarding  the
Company's asset divestitures.

     The  Company  anticipates  that it  will  continue  to  sell  non-strategic
properties  or other  assets  from time to time to  increase  capital  resources
available  for  other  activities,   to  achieve  operating  and  administrative
efficiencies and to improve profitability.

Operations by Geographic Area

     The Company operates in one industry segment.  During the three years ended
December  31,  2004,  the  Company  had oil and gas  producing  and  development
activities in the United States,  Argentina,  Canada,  South Africa and Tunisia,
and  had  exploration  activities  in  the  United  States,  Argentina,  Canada,
Equatorial  Guinea,  Gabon,  South  Africa and  Tunisia.  See Note S of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data" for geographic  operating  segment  information,  including
results of operations and segment assets.

Marketing of Production

     General. Production from the Company's properties is marketed using methods
that are consistent with industry  practices.  Sales prices for oil, NGL and gas
production are negotiated based on factors normally  considered in the industry,
such as the index or spot  price  for gas or the  posted  price  for oil,  price
regulations,  distance from the well to the pipeline,  well pressure,  estimated
reserves,  commodity quality and prevailing supply conditions. In Argentina, the
Company  receives  significantly  lower prices for its production as a result of
the  Argentine   government's   imposed  price  limitations.   See  "Qualitative
Disclosures" in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About Market
Risk" for additional  discussion of Argentine foreign  currency,  operations and
price risk.

     Significant  purchasers.  During  the year ended  December  31,  2004,  the
Company's  primary  purchasers of oil, NGLs and gas were Williams Power Company,
Inc.  (12  percent),   Occidental   Energy   Marketing,   Inc.  (six   percent),
ConocoPhillips (six percent),  Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (five percent)
and Plains  Marketing LP (four percent).  The Company is of the opinion that the
loss of any one  purchaser  would not have an adverse  effect on its  ability to
sell its oil, NGL and gas production.

     Hedging activities.  The Company utilizes commodity derivative contracts in
order to (i)  reduce  the  effect of price  volatility  on the  commodities  the
Company produces and sells,  (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting









and  expenditure  plans and (iii) reduce  commodity  price risk  associated with
certain capital projects.  See "Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations"  for a  description  of  the
Company's hedging activities, "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About  Market  Risk" and Note K of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
included  in  "Item  8.  Financial   Statements  and  Supplementary   Data"  for
information concerning the impact on oil and gas revenues during the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 from the Company's commodity hedging activities
and the Company's open commodity hedge positions at December 31, 2004.

Competition, Markets and Regulations

     Competition. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. A large number
of companies and  individuals  engage in the  exploration for and development of
oil and gas  properties,  and there is a high degree of competition  for oil and
gas properties suitable for development or exploration.  Acquisitions of oil and
gas  properties  have been an important  element of the  Company's  growth.  The
Company  intends to continue to acquire oil and gas properties  that  complement
its  operations,   provide   exploration  and  development   opportunities   and
potentially  provide superior returns on investment.  The principal  competitive
factors in the acquisition of oil and gas properties  include the staff and data
necessary  to  identify,  investigate  and  purchase  such  properties  and  the
financial resources necessary to acquire and develop the properties. Many of the
Company's  competitors  are  substantially  larger and have  financial and other
resources greater than those of the Company.

     Markets.  The  Company's  ability to produce and market  oil,  NGLs and gas
profitably depends on numerous factors beyond the Company's control.  The effect
of these factors  cannot be accurately  predicted or  anticipated.  Although the
Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect these  commodity
prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected,  the prices for any
commodity that the Company  produces will generally  approximate  current market
prices in the geographic region of the production.

     Governmental  regulations.  Enterprises  that  sell  securities  in  public
markets are subject to  regulatory  oversight by agencies  such as the SEC. This
regulatory  oversight imposes on the Company the responsibility for establishing
and  maintaining  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  that will  ensure  that
material information  relating to the Company and its consolidated  subsidiaries
is made known to the Company's  management and that the financial statements and
other  financial  information  included in this Report do not contain any untrue
statement of a material  fact,  or omit to state a material  fact,  necessary to
make the statements made in this Report not misleading.

     Oil and gas  exploration  and  production  operations  are also  subject to
various  types of  regulation  by local,  state,  federal and foreign  agencies.
Additionally,  the Company's  operations are subject to state  conservation laws
and regulations,  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and
gas properties,  the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells and
the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of wells. States and foreign
governments  generally  impose a  production  or  severance  tax with respect to
production and sale of oil and gas within their  respective  jurisdictions.  The
regulatory  burden on the oil and gas industry  increases the Company's  cost of
doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability.

     Additional  proposals  and  proceedings  that might  affect the oil and gas
industry  are  considered  from time to time by  Congress,  the  Federal  Energy
Regulatory   Commission,   state  regulatory  bodies,  the  courts  and  foreign
governments.  The Company  cannot  predict when or if any such  proposals  might
become effective or their effect, if any, on the Company's operations.

     Environmental and health controls.  The Company's operations are subject to
numerous  federal,  state,  local and foreign laws and  regulations  relating to
environmental and health protection.  These laws and regulations may require the
acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the type, quantities
and  concentration  of  various   substances  that  can  be  released  into  the
environment  in connection  with drilling and  production  activities,  limit or
prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness,  wetlands
and other  protected  areas and impose  substantial  liabilities  for  pollution
resulting  from oil and gas  operations.  These  laws and  regulations  may also
restrict air emissions or other  discharges  resulting from the operation of gas
processing plants,  pipeline systems and other facilities that the Company owns.
Although  the Company  believes  that  compliance  with  environmental  laws and
regulations  will not have a material  adverse  effect on its future  results of
operations or financial  condition,  risks of substantial  costs and liabilities









are  inherent  in oil and gas  operations,  and there can be no  assurance  that
significant costs and liabilities,  including potential criminal penalties, will
not be  incurred.  Moreover,  it is possible  that other  developments,  such as
stricter environmental laws and regulations or claims for damages to property or
persons  resulting  from the Company's  operations,  could result in substantial
costs and liabilities.

     The Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation,  and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability, without regard
to fault or the legality of the original conduct,  on certain classes of persons
with respect to the release of a  "hazardous  substance"  into the  environment.
These persons  include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where
the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of
hazardous  substances  released at the site. Persons who are or were responsible
for  releases of hazardous  substances  under CERCLA may be subject to joint and
several  liability  for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous  substances  that
have been released into the  environment  and for damages to natural  resources,
and it is not uncommon for  neighboring  landowners  and other third  parties to
file claims for personal  injury and  property  damage  allegedly  caused by the
hazardous substances released into the environment.

     The Company generates wastes,  including hazardous wastes, that are subject
to the federal  Resource  Conservation  and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable
state statutes.  The United States  Environmental  Protection Agency and various
state  agencies  have  limited  the  approved  methods of  disposal  for certain
hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the
Company's oil and gas  operations  that are currently  exempt from  treatment as
hazardous  wastes may in the  future be  designated  as  hazardous  wastes,  and
therefore  be  subject  to more  rigorous  and  costly  operating  and  disposal
requirements.

     The Company currently owns or leases,  and has in the past owned or leased,
properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production
of oil and gas  reserves.  Although the Company has used  operating and disposal
practices that were standard in the industry at the time,  hydrocarbons or other
wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or
leased by the Company or on or under other locations where such wastes have been
taken for disposal. In addition,  some of these properties have been operated by
third parties whose  treatment and disposal or release of  hydrocarbons or other
wastes was not under the  Company's  control.  These  properties  and the wastes
disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA,  RCRA and analogous state and foreign
laws.  Under such laws,  the Company  could be  required to remove or  remediate
previously  disposed  wastes or property  contamination  or to perform  remedial
plugging operations to prevent future contamination.

     Federal  regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that
store or otherwise  handle oil,  such as the Company,  to prepare and  implement
spill prevention control plans, countermeasure plans and facility response plans
relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution
Act of 1990 ("OPA")  amends  certain  provisions of the federal Water  Pollution
Control Act of 1972,  commonly  referred to as the Clean Water Act ("CWA"),  and
other  statutes as they pertain to the  prevention of and response to oil spills
into navigable waters. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and
several  liability  for all  containment  and cleanup  costs and  certain  other
damages  arising  from a spill,  including,  but not  limited  to,  the costs of
responding to a release of oil to surface waters. The CWA provides penalties for
any  discharges  of  petroleum  products in  reportable  quantities  and imposes
substantial   liability  for  the  costs  of  removing  a  spill.  OPA  requires
responsible   parties  to   establish   and   maintain   evidence  of  financial
responsibility  to cover removal costs and damages  resulting from an oil spill.
OPA calls for a  financial  responsibility  of $35  million  to cover  pollution
cleanup for offshore  facilities.  State laws for the control of water pollution
also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of
releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground.
The Company  does not believe  that the OPA,  CWA or related  state laws are any
more  burdensome  to it than they are to other  similarly  situated  oil and gas
companies.

     Many  states in which the Company  operates  regulate  naturally  occurring
radioactive  materials ("NORM") and NORM wastes that are generated in connection
with oil and gas exploration and production  activities.  NORM wastes  typically
consist of very low-level  radioactive  substances  that become  concentrated in
pipe scale and in production  equipment.  Certain state regulations  require the
testing  of pipes  and  production  equipment  for the  presence  of  NORM,  the
licensing of NORM-contaminated  facilities and the careful handling and disposal
of NORM  wastes.  The  regulation  of NORM has minimal  effect on the  Company's
operations  because the Company  generates  only small  quantities of NORM on an
annual basis.










     The Company does not believe that its  environmental  risks are  materially
different  from  those  of  comparable  companies  in the oil and gas  industry.
Nevertheless,  no assurance can be given that environmental laws will not result
in a curtailment of production or processing,  a material  increase in the costs
of production,  development,  exploration  or processing or otherwise  adversely
affect the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.

     The  Company  employs an  environmental  director,  regulatory  manager and
regulatory and environmental  specialists charged with monitoring  environmental
and regulatory compliance.  The Company performs an environmental review as part
of the due diligence work on potential acquisitions. The Company is not aware of
any material  environmental legal proceedings pending against it or any material
environmental liabilities to which it may be subject.

Risks Associated with Business Activities

     The nature of the business activities  conducted by the Company subjects it
to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material
risks relating to the Company's business activities.

     Commodity  prices.  The Company's  revenues,  profitability,  cash flow and
future  rate of growth are highly  dependent  on oil and gas  prices,  which are
affected by numerous  factors beyond the Company's  control.  Oil and gas prices
historically have been very volatile.  A significant downward trend in commodity
prices  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  revenues,
profitability and cash flow and could, under certain circumstances,  result in a
reduction in the carrying  value of the  Company's  oil and gas  properties  and
goodwill and the  recognition of deferred tax asset  valuation  allowances or an
increase to the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowances,  depending on
the Company's tax attributes in each country in which it has activities.

     Drilling activities.  Drilling involves numerous risks,  including the risk
that no commercially  productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.  The
cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and drilling
operations  may be  curtailed,  delayed or  canceled as a result of a variety of
factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in
formations,  equipment  failures or accidents,  adverse  weather  conditions and
shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.  The Company's future drilling
activities may not be successful and, if  unsuccessful,  such failure could have
an adverse  effect on the Company's  future  results of operations and financial
condition.  While all drilling,  whether developmental or exploratory,  involves
these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure
to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.  Because of the percentage of the
Company's  capital budget  devoted to higher risk  exploratory  projects,  it is
likely that the Company will continue to experience  exploration and abandonment
expense.

     Unproved  properties.  At December 31, 2004 and 2003,  the Company  carried
unproved  property  costs of $470.4  million and $179.8  million,  respectively.
Generally accepted  accounting  principles require periodic  evaluation of these
costs on a project-by-project basis in comparison to their estimated fair value.
These  evaluations  will be affected by the results of  exploration  activities,
commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion
of the  leases,  contracts  and permits  appurtenant  to such  projects.  If the
quantity of potential reserves  determined by such evaluations is not sufficient
to fully recover the cost invested in each project,  the Company will  recognize
noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.

     Acquisitions.  Acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have been a
key element of the Company's  growth.  The Company's  growth  following the full
development  of its existing  property  base could be impeded if it is unable to
acquire  additional oil and gas reserves on a profitable  basis.  The success of
any  acquisition  will depend on a number of factors,  including  the ability to
estimate  accurately the costs to develop the reserves,  the recoverable volumes
of reserves,  rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from
the  reserves and to assess  possible  environmental  liabilities.  All of these
factors  affect  whether an  acquisition  will  ultimately  generate  cash flows
sufficient to provide a suitable  return on investment.  Even though the Company
performs a review of the  properties  it seeks to acquire  that it  believes  is
consistent with industry practices, such reviews are often limited in scope.

     Divestitures.  The  Company  regularly  reviews its  property  base for the
purpose of  identifying  non-strategic  assets,  the  disposition of which would
increase   capital   resources   available  for  other   activities  and  create
organizational  and operational  efficiencies.  Various factors could materially








affect the ability of the Company to dispose of non-strategic assets,  including
the availability of purchasers  willing to purchase the non-strategic  assets at
prices acceptable to the Company.

     Operation of natural gas  processing  plants.  As of December 31, 2004, the
Company owned  interests in 11 natural gas  processing  plants and five treating
facilities.  The  Company  operates  seven of the plants  and all five  treating
facilities. There are significant risks associated with the operation of natural
gas processing  plants.  Gas and NGLs are volatile and explosive and may include
carcinogens.  Damage to or  misoperation  of a gas processing  plant or facility
could result in an explosion or the discharge of toxic gases, which could result
in significant damage claims in addition to interrupting a revenue source.

     Operating  hazards and  uninsured  losses.  The  Company's  operations  are
subject to all the risks normally  incident to the oil and gas  exploration  and
production business, including blowouts, cratering,  explosions, adverse weather
effects and pollution and other environmental  damage, any of which could result
in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or
destruction  of  wells,  production  facilities  or  other  property,   clean-up
responsibilities,  regulatory  investigations  and penalties  and  suspension of
operations.  Although the Company currently maintains insurance coverage that it
considers  reasonable  and that is  similar  to that  maintained  by  comparable
companies in the oil and gas industry,  it is not fully insured  against certain
of these risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of the
high premium costs associated with obtaining such insurance.

     Environmental.  The  oil and  gas  business  is  subject  to  environmental
hazards,  such as oil spills,  produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and
discharges  of toxic  substances  or gases  that  could  expose  the  Company to
substantial liability due to pollution and other environmental damage. A variety
of federal,  state and foreign  laws and  regulations  govern the  environmental
aspects  of the  oil  and  gas  business.  Noncompliance  with  these  laws  and
regulations may subject the Company to penalties,  damages or other liabilities,
and compliance may increase the cost of the Company's operations.  Such laws and
regulations may also affect the costs of  acquisitions.  See "Item 1. Business -
Competition,  Markets and Regulations - Environmental and health controls" above
for additional discussion related to environmental risks.

     The Company does not believe that its  environmental  risks are  materially
different  from  those  of  comparable  companies  in the oil and gas  industry.
Nevertheless,  no assurance can be given that future environmental laws will not
result in a curtailment of production or processing,  a material increase in the
costs  of  production,  development,  exploration  or  processing  or  otherwise
adversely  affect the  Company's  future  operations  and  financial  condition.
Pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.

     Debt restrictions and  availability.  The Company is a borrower under fixed
term  senior  notes  and  variable  rate  credit  facilities.  The  terms of the
Company's  borrowings under the senior notes and the credit  facilities  specify
scheduled  debt  repayments  and  require  the  Company to comply  with  certain
associated covenants and restrictions.  The Company's ability to comply with the
debt repayment  terms,  associated  covenants and  restrictions is dependent on,
among other  things,  factors  outside the  Company's  direct  control,  such as
commodity  prices,  interest rates and competition for available debt financing.
See Note F of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in "Item 8.
Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for  information  regarding the
Company's  outstanding  debt as of December  31,  2004 and the terms  associated
therewith.

     The Company's  ability to obtain  additional  financing is also impacted by
the Company's  debt credit  ratings.  See "Item 7.  Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations"  for a discussion of
the Company's debt credit ratings.

     Competition.  The oil and gas industry is highly  competitive.  The Company
competes with other  companies,  producers and operators for acquisitions and in
the exploration,  development,  production and marketing of oil and gas. Some of
these competitors have substantially  greater financial and other resources than
the Company. See "Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulations" above
for additional discussion regarding competition.









     Government regulation.  The Company's business is regulated by a variety of
federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations.  There  can be no
assurance  that  present or future  regulations  will not  adversely  affect the
Company's business and operations. See "Item 1. Business - Competition,  Markets
and  Regulations"   above  for  additional   discussion   regarding   government
regulation.

     International operations. At December 31, 2004, approximately 15 percent of
the  Company's  proved  reserves of oil,  NGLs and gas were located  outside the
United States (12 percent in Argentina, two percent in Canada and one percent in
Africa).  The success  and  profitability  of  international  operations  may be
adversely affected by risks associated with international activities,  including
economic and labor conditions,  political instability, tax laws (including host-
country  import-export,  excise and  income  taxes and  United  States  taxes on
foreign  subsidiaries)  and changes in the value of the U.S.  dollar  versus the
local  currencies in which oil and gas producing  activities may be denominated.
To the extent that the Company is involved in international activities,  changes

     Estimates of reserves and future net revenues. Numerous uncertainties exist
in estimating  quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues  therefrom.
The  estimates of proved  reserves and related  future net revenues set forth in
this Report are based on various  assumptions,  which may ultimately prove to be
inaccurate.

     Petroleum  engineering  is a subjective  process of estimating  underground
accumulations  of oil and gas  that  cannot  be  measured  in an  exact  manner.
Estimates  of  economically  recoverable  oil and gas reserves and of future net
cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions,
including the following:

     o   historical production from the area compared with production from other
         producing areas,
     o   the quality and quantity of available data,
     o   the interpretation of that data,
     o   the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies,
     o   assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices and
     o   assumptions concerning  future operating costs,  severance,  ad valorem
         and excise taxes, development costs and workover and remedial costs.

     Because all reserve  estimates are to some degree  subjective,  each of the
following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves:

     o   the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered,
     o   the production and operating costs incurred,
     o   the amount and timing of future development expenditures and
     o   future oil and gas sales prices.

     Furthermore,  different reserve  engineers may make different  estimates of
reserves and cash flows based on the same available  data. The Company's  actual
production,  revenues and  expenditures  with respect to reserves will likely be
different from estimates and the difference may be material.

     As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from
proved  reserves are  generally  based on prices and costs as of the date of the
estimate,  while  actual  future  prices and costs may be  materially  higher or
lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:

     o   the amount and timing of actual production,
     o   supply and demand of oil and gas,
     o   increases or decreases in consumption and
     o   changes in governmental regulations or taxation.









     The  Company  reports all proved  reserves  held under  production  sharing
arrangements and concessions  utilizing the "economic  interest"  method,  which
excludes the host country's share of proved  reserves.  Estimated  quantities of
production sharing  arrangements  reported under the "economic  interest" method
are  subject  to  fluctuations  in the  price  of oil and  gas  and  recoverable
operating expenses and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities
attributable to recovery of costs will change  inversely to changes in commodity
prices.

     Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis
for comparing oil and gas companies  subject to the rules and regulations of the
SEC. It requires the use of oil and gas spot prices prevailing as of the date of
computation.  Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or
that will be  received  for oil and gas  production  because of  seasonal  price
fluctuations or other varying market conditions. Standardized Measures as of any
date  are  not   necessarily   indicative  of  future   results  of  operations.
Accordingly,  estimates included herein of future net revenues may be materially
different from the net revenues that are  ultimately  received.  Therefore,  the
estimates of discounted  future net cash flows or  Standardized  Measure in this
Report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value
of the Company's proved reserves.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

     The  information  included in this Report about the Company's  oil, NGL and
gas  reserves  as of  December  31,  2004 and 2003 was based on reserve  reports
audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSA") for the Company's major
properties in the United States, Argentina,  Canada and South Africa and reserve
reports  prepared  by the  Company's  engineers  for all other  properties.  The
reserve  audits  conducted  by NSA in  aggregate  represented  88 percent and 87
percent of the Company's  estimated proved quantities of reserves as of December
31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  The information included in this Report about
the  Company's  oil,  NGL and gas reserves as of December 31, 2002 was, in part,
based on reserve reports audited by independent  petroleum engineers and reserve
reports  prepared by the Company's  engineers.  These reserve  audits  conducted
represented 71 percent of the Company's  estimated proved quantities of reserves
as of December 31, 2002.

     The Company did not provide  estimates of total proved oil and gas reserves
during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002 to any federal  authority
or agency,  other than the SEC. The Company's  reserve  estimates do not include
any probable or possible reserves.

Proved Reserves

     The  Company's  proved  reserves  totaled 1.0 billion BOE,  789.1 MMBOE and
736.7 MMBOE at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, representing $6.6
billion, $4.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of Standardized Measure or
$9.1 billion, $6.0 billion and $5.1 billion,  respectively,  on a pre-tax basis.
The  30  percent  and  45  percent  increases  in  proved  reserve  volumes  and
Standardized Measure, respectively, during 2004 were primarily due to:

     o   Evergreen merger - 262.2 MMBOE,
     o   other 2004 acquisitions - 16.0 MMBOE,
     o   extensions and discoveries in:
         -   Argentina - 25.8 MMBOE,
         -   United States - 10.5 MMBOE,
         -   Canada - 2.3 MMBOE and
         -   Africa - .5 MMBOE,
     o   negative revisions of 14.3 MMBOE primarily due to:
         -   16.6 MMBOE due to the cancellation of the Gabon project as a result
             of increasing costs,
         -   negative well  performance  in the  Portezuelo  Oeste gas  field in
             Argentina, offset by
         -   increased commodity prices extending the estimated economic life of
             various properties,
     o   production (including field fuel) during 2004 of 68.7 MMBOE and
     o   divestitures of 1.1 MMBOE.

     The seven percent and 11 percent  increases in proved  reserve  volumes and
Standardized Measure,  respectively,  during 2003 were primarily due to two core
area  acquisitions,  discoveries  in Gabon,  the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico  and
Tunisia  and  positive  reserve  revisions  due to  increased  commodity  prices
extending  the  estimated  economic  life  of  various   properties,   increased
recoverable  reserve  estimates  based on well  performance  and the addition of









reserves  resulting from the Company's  expanded  development  drilling program.
Partially  offsetting these reserve additions was 2003 production of 56.5 MMBOE,
including field fuel.

     On a BOE basis,  65 percent  of the  Company's  total  proved  reserves  at
December 31, 2004 were proved developed  reserves.  Based on reserve information
as of December 31, 2004, and using the Company's production  information for the
year then ended, the  reserve-to-production  ratio associated with the Company's
proved  reserves  was 15 years on a BOE  basis.  The  following  table  provides
information  regarding  the  Company's  proved  reserves and average daily sales
volumes by geographic area as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004:

           PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND AVERAGE DAILY SALES VOLUMES


     The  following  table  represents  the  estimated  timing and cash flows of
developing the Company's proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2004:


Description of Properties

     As of December 31, 2004,  the Company has  production,  development  and/or
exploration  operations  in the United  States,  Argentina,  Canada,  Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon, South Africa and Tunisia.

     Domestic.  The  Company's  domestic  operations  are located in the Permian
Basin, Mid-Continent,  Rocky Mountains,  Alaska, Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf
Coast  areas of the United  States.  Approximately  75 percent of the  Company's
domestic  proved  reserves  at December  31, 2004 are located in the  Spraberry,
Hugoton,   West  Panhandle  and  Raton  fields.  These  mature  fields  generate
substantial operating  cash flow and some  have a  large portfolio  of low  risk








infill  drilling  opportunities.  The cash flows  generated  from  these  fields
provide funding for the Company's other  development and exploration  activities
both domestically and internationally.  During the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company  expended  $2.9  billion in domestic  acquisition,  exploration  and
development drilling activities,  $2.5 billion of which related to the Evergreen
merger.  The Company  has  budgeted  approximately  $700  million  for  domestic
exploration and development drilling expenditures for 2005.

     Spraberry field. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and encompasses
eight counties in West Texas. The field is  approximately  150 miles long and 75
miles wide at its widest  point.  The oil  produced  is West Texas  Intermediate
Sweet,  and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average energy content of
1,400 Btu.  The oil and gas is produced  primarily  from three  formations,  the
upper and lower  Spraberry  and the Dean,  at depths  ranging from 6,700 feet to
9,200 feet.  Recently,  the Company has been adding the  Wolfcamp  formation  at
depths ranging from 9,300 feet to 10,300 feet to selected wells with  successful
results.  The center of the  Spraberry  field was unitized in the late 1950s and
early 1960s by the major oil companies;  however, until the late 1980s there was
very limited  development  activity in the field.  The Company believes the area
offers  excellent  opportunities  to enhance oil and gas reserves because of the
numerous  undeveloped infill drilling locations,  many of which are reflected in
the Company's proved undeveloped  reserves,  and the ability to reduce operating
expenses through economies of scale.

     During the year ended  December 31, 2004,  the Company placed 104 Spraberry
wells on  production  and had 16 wells in progress as of December 31, 2004.  The
Company  plans to drill  approximately  150  development  wells in the Spraberry
field during 2005.

     Hugoton field.  The Hugoton field in southwest Kansas is one of the largest
producing gas fields in the continental  United States. The gas is produced from
the Chase and Council  Grove  formations  at depths  ranging  from 2,700 feet to
3,000 feet. The Company's gas in the Hugoton field has an average energy content
of 1,025 Btu. The  Company's  Hugoton  properties  are located on  approximately
257,000  gross acres  (237,000  net acres),  covering  approximately  400 square
miles.  The Company has working  interests in  approximately  1,200 wells in the
Hugoton field,  about 1,000 of which it operates,  and partial royalty interests
in approximately 500 wells. The Company owns  substantially all of the gathering
and  processing  facilities,  primarily  the  Satanta  plant,  that  service its
production from the Hugoton field.  Such ownership allows the Company to control
the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and NGL production.

     The Company's Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing approximately
90.5  MMcf of wet gas per day  (i.e.,  gas  production  at the  wellhead  before
processing  or field  fuel use and before  reduction  for  royalties),  although
actual  production in the Hugoton  field is limited by  allowables  set by state
regulators.  The  Company  estimates  that it and other major  producers  in the
Hugoton field  produced at or near capacity  during the year ended  December 31,
2004. During 2004, the Company placed 17 development wells on production and had
one well in  progress  as of  December  31,  2004.  The plans  for 2005  include
drilling  approximately  18  development  wells and one potential new horizontal
well.

     The Company is continuing to evaluate the  feasibility  of infill  drilling
into the Council  Grove  Formation and may submit an  application  to the Kansas
Corporation  Commission  to allow  infill  drilling.  Such infill  drilling  may
increase  production from the Company's Hugoton  properties.  However,  until an
application has been submitted and approved, the Company will not reflect any of
the infill drilling  locations as proved undeveloped  reserves.  There can be no
assurance that the application will be filed or approved, or as to the timing of
such approval if granted.

     West  Panhandle  field.  The West  Panhandle  properties are located in the
panhandle  region of Texas where  initial  production  commenced in 1918.  These
stable,  long-lived  reserves are  attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite,
Granite Wash and  fractured  Granite  formations at depths no greater than 3,500
feet.  The  Company's  gas in the West  Panhandle  field has an  average  energy
content of 1,300 Btu and is produced from  approximately  600 wells on more than
250,000 gross acres  covering over 375 square  miles.  The Company  controls 100
percent of the wells, production equipment,  gathering system and gas processing
plant for the field.

     During the year ended  December 31, 2004, the Company placed 78 development
wells on production and drilled three  development wells and two extension wells
which  were  determined  to be  unsuccessful.  The West  Panhandle  field had 11
development  wells in progress as of December  31,  2004.  The Company  plans to
drill approximately 90 wells in the West Panhandle field during 2005.









     Rocky Mountain  area.  The Company is one of the leading U.S.  producers of
coal bed  methane  ("CBM")  with the  Raton,  Piceance  and Uinta  Basin  assets
acquired from Evergreen which are situated in Colorado and Utah. Exploration for
CBM in the Raton  Basin began in the late 1970s and  continued  through the late
1980s,  with several  companies  drilling and testing more than 100 wells during
this  period.  The absence of a pipeline to  transport  gas from the Raton Basin
prevented full scale  development  until January 1995, when Colorado  Interstate
Gas Company  completed the construction of the Picketwire  lateral.  The Company
owns  approximately  385,000  gross  acres in the center of the Raton Basin with
current  production  from coal seams of the  Vermejo and Raton  formations.  The
Company  also owns  approximately  171,000  acres  covering  highly  prospective
regions of the Piceance and Uinta Basins.  Currently,  production is established
from  various  tight  sandstone,  coal and shale  formations.  The  Company  has
approximately  1,300 wells in these fields with an average daily gross  measured
production of 191 MMcf.  In the fourth  quarter of 2004,  the Company  placed 49
development  wells on production  and drilled two  successful  extension  wells.
Plans for 2005 include the drilling of approximately  300 development  wells and
20 extension wells to establish additional prospective areas and reserves.

     Gulf of Mexico  area.  In the Gulf of  Mexico,  the  Company  is focused on
reserve  and  production  growth  through a  portfolio  of shelf  and  deepwater
development projects,  high-impact,  higher-risk deepwater exploration drilling,
shelf  exploration  drilling  and  exploitation  opportunities  inherent  in the
properties the Company currently has producing on the shelf.

     In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Company has three major projects,  all
of which were producing or capable of producing at December 31, 2004:

       o      Canyon Express - The Canyon Express project is a joint development
              of three deepwater Gulf of Mexico gas  discoveries,  including the
              Company's  TotalFinaElf-operated  Aconcagua and  Marathon-operated
              Camden Hills fields, where the Company holds 37.5 percent and 33.3
              percent working interests, respectively.  The Company participated
              in the  discovery  of the  Aconcagua  gas field in 1999 during the
              early stages of building its  exploration program  and later added
              Camden Hills  to its  portfolio to  enhance its  ownership  in the
              project.  The Canyon  Express project was approved for development
              in June 2000 and  reached first production in September 2002.  The
              Canyon  Express  gathering  system  is the first  in the  area and
              provides the  Company and its  partners  with  the opportunity  to
              collect gathering and handling revenues from the use of the system
              by any future discoveries  in the area.  The Company  has plans to
              drill and  complete  an additional  development well  at Aconcagua
              during 2005.

       o      Falcon Corridor - The Falcon  Corridor  project  started  with the
              Company's Falcon field discovery during 2001, followed by the 2003
              Harrier, Raptor and  Tomahawk discoveries.  The Company owned a 45
              percent  working  interest  in the initial  Falcon  discovery  and
              surrounding  areas.   During  2002,   the  Company  purchased   an
              additional 30 percent working  interest in the project  and became
              the operator.  During 2003,  the Company acquired the remaining 25
              percent  working  interest  in the  project and  established first
              Falcon production during March 2003.

              In the first  quarter  of 2003,  the Company  drilled its  Harrier
              discovery,  which was completed as  a one-well  subsea tie-back to
              the  Falcon field  facilities and placed on  production in January
              2004.  In addition,  during the third quarter of 2003, the Company
              successfully drilled the Tomahawk and Raptor prospects, which were
              also developed as single-well subsea tie-backs to the Falcon field
              facilities and placed on production in  June 2004.  To accommodate
              the incremental production from Harrier,  Tomahawk and Raptor,  as
              well as  potential throughput  associated with  additional planned
              exploration, an additional parallel pipeline connecting the Falcon
              field to the Falcon Nest platform on the  Gulf of Mexico shelf was
              added, doubling its capacity. In early September 2004, the Company
              shut in  production  from the  Harrier field  as a result of early
              water encroachment. The Company initiated a sidetrack well in late
              September to access an adjacent fault block in the field which was
              successful,  encountering  over  400 feet of gas-bearing sand.  In
              order to capture the maximum reserves from the Raptor and Tomahawk
              fields, the Company delayed production from the  Harrier sidetrack
              until the Tomahawk field was fully depleted in December 2004. Once
              the Harrier sidetrack was placed on  production,  the Falcon field
              production rate was  reduced to  continue to allow Raptor to fully
              deplete.  Raptor is anticipated  to be  depleted  during the first
              half  of  2005,  at  which  time  production  from Falcon  will be
              increased. The Company operates all of the producing fields in the








              Falcon Corridor.  Sidetrack operations are being evaluated for the
              Raptor  field in 2005  to further  increase  reserve recovery.  In
              addition, the Company plans to  drill one  or two  Falcon Corridor
              exploration prospects during the first half of 2005.

       o      Devils Tower Area - The Dominion-operated Devils Tower development
              project was sanctioned in 2001  as a spar development project with
              the owners leasing a  spar from a third  party for the life of the
              field.  The spar has slots for eight dry tree wells and up to four
              subsea tie-back risers and is capable of handling 60  MBbls of oil
              per day and 60 MMcf of gas per day.  Three Devils Tower wells were
              completed and placed on production prior to  being shut-in  during
              mid-September  due  to  Hurricane  Ivan.   The  Devils  Tower spar
              sustained significant damage during Hurricane Ivan, and production
              from the three wells did  not resume  until late October  2004.  A
              fourth well began producing at the end of November.  The damage to
              the  platform  rig  sustained   during   Hurricane  Ivan   delayed
              completion  activities  related  to   the  four  additional  wells
              previously drilled  to develop the field.  Rig  repairs  took  120
              days, and completion activities for  continued  field  development
              began   late   in  January   2005.   Pioneer  maintains   business
              interruption insurance and has filed a claim related to four wells
              that were  expected to be  completed  but were  delayed due to the
              effects of the  hurricane.  In the  fourth  quarter  of 2004,  the
              Company recorded  approximately $7.5 million of estimated business
              interruption  recovery  related to  its estimated  2004 production
              loss and should have  additional insurance  recoveries  associated
              with  2005 operational impact  from Hurricane Ivan.  In  addition,
              three subsea tie-back wells in the Goldfinger and Triton satellite
              discoveries in the Devils  Tower area  are expected to be  jointly
              tied back to the  Devils Tower spar with first production expected
              in late 2005.  Production is  expected to  continue to increase as
              additional wells are individually completed from the spar over the
              next six months.  The Company holds a 25 percent  working interest
              in each of the above projects.

     In addition to the development  and  exploration  projects in the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico  described  above,  the  Company  participated  in three  subsalt
deepwater  prospects  during  the  first  half of 2004,  of  which  one well was
successful and two were noncommercial. A sidetrack well in the Dominion-operated
Thunder Hawk discovery at Mississippi  Canyon Block 734 encountered in excess of
300 feet of net oil pay in two high-quality  reservoir zones. Murphy Exploration
and  Production  Company  is now the  operator  and has  commenced  drilling  an
additional well to further  delineate the field. The Company owns a 12.5 percent
working  interest in the  discovery.  The Company also  anticipates  drilling an
appraisal well during 2005 on its 2002 Ozona Deep discovery.

     During January 2003, the Company  announced a joint  exploration  agreement
with Woodside Energy (USA), Inc.  ("Woodside"),  a subsidiary of Woodside Energy
Ltd. of Australia,  for a two-year drilling program over the shallow-water Texas
shelf region of the Gulf of Mexico. Under the agreement,  Woodside acquired a 50
percent  working  interest in 47  offshore  exploration  blocks  operated by the
Company.  The  agreement  covers eight  prospects and 19 leads and included five
exploratory wells originally  scheduled to be drilled in 2003 and three in 2004.
Most of the wells to be  drilled  under the  agreement  target  gas plays  below
15,000 feet. The first three wells under this joint agreement were unsuccessful.
The fourth well,  Midway,  encountered 30 feet of net gas pay and is expected to
be  tied  back  to  an  existing   production  platform  with  first  production
anticipated  during the second  quarter of 2005.  Three other  intervals with an
additional 60 feet of gas bearing sands were also  encountered  and will require
additional analysis to determine future commercial potential.  The Company has a
37.5 percent  working  interest in this well. The fifth well that was originally
scheduled to be drilled in 2003 and the three wells  originally  scheduled to be
drilled in 2004 under the agreement,  which has been extended for one additional
year,  were  mutually  agreed to be deferred  until more  technical  work can be
performed on the  prospects  by both  companies.  Additionally,  the Company and
Woodside are evaluating  shallower gas prospects on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for
possible inclusion in the 2005 drilling program.

     Onshore Gulf Coast area.  The Company has focused its  drilling  efforts in
this area on the Pawnee  field in the  Edwards  Reef trend in South  Texas.  The
Company  placed 10  development  wells and two extension  wells on production at
Pawnee  during  2004 and had two  development  wells and one  extension  well in
progress at year end. The Company plans to drill  approximately 12 wells in this
area during 2005.

     Alaska area.  The Company  spent $34.7 million of  acquisition  and seismic
capital during 2004 to add to its leasehold  position and expand its North Slope
seismic data coverage. In June 2004, Pioneer announced that it agreed to a joint
exploration program in the National Petroleum  Reserve-Alaska  ("NPR-A") located
on the North Slope with  ConocoPhillips and Anadarko Petroleum  Corporation.  At
the federal lease  sale held in June 2004, P ioneer was the high co-bidder on 63








tracts  covering  approximately  717,000 acres in the NPR-A  Northwest  Planning
Area.  Pioneer will participate with a 20 percent to 30 percent working interest
in the acreage  operated by  ConocoPhillips.  Pioneer also acquired a 20 percent
interest in 167,000 total acres in the adjacent  NPR-A  Northeast  Planning Area
and in federal offshore blocks, including seismic and geologic data. In December
2004, Pioneer signed an exploration  agreement with  ConocoPhillips and Anadarko
acquiring a 20 percent  interest in approximately  452,000  additional acres and
gaining the rights to extensive seismic and geologic data in the NPR-A Northeast
Planning  Area.  Pioneer  expects to  participate  in a  multi-year  exploration
program within NPR-A and anticipates that two exploration  wells will be drilled
during the first half of 2005.

     During the first quarter of 2005,  Pioneer will also  participate with a 40
percent  working  interest in an  exploration  well to evaluate  the  Kerr-McGee
Corporation - Tuvaaq prospect.  In addition,  Pioneer holds a 50 percent working
interest in a 130,000-acre  position  adjacent to and south of the giant Prudhoe
Bay and Kuparuk Units and has a new 3-D seismic  survey  underway for completion
during the first quarter of 2005.

     During  2002,  the  Company  acquired a 70  percent  working  interest  and
operatorship in ten state leases on Alaska's North Slope.  Associated therewith,
the  Company  drilled  three  exploratory  wells  during 2003 to test a possible
extension of the  productive  sands in the Kuparuk  River field into the shallow
waters  offshore.  Although  all three of the wells found the sands  filled with
oil,  they were too thin to be considered  commercial  on a  stand-alone  basis.
However, the wells also encountered thick sections of oil-bearing  Jurassic-aged
sands,  and the first well flowed at a rate of  approximately  1,300 barrels per
day. In January  2004,  the Company  farmed-into  a large  acreage  block to the
southwest of the Company's  discovery.  In the fourth  quarter of 2004,  Pioneer
completed  an  extensive  technical  and  economic  evaluation  of the  resource
potential  within  this area.  As a result of this  evaluation,  the  Company is
performing front-end engineering and permitting activities to further define the
scope of the project.  If the  additional  work confirms  favorable  development
economics,  Pioneer will seek to obtain regulatory approval to develop the field
in 2006 targeting first oil in 2008.

     International.  The Company's  international  operations are located in the
Neuquen and Austral  Basins areas of  Argentina,  the  Chinchaga,  Martin Creek,
Lookout  Butte and Carbon areas of Canada,  the Sable oil field  offshore  South
Africa and in southern Tunisia.  Additionally, the Company has other development
and  exploration  activities in the shallow waters offshore South Africa and oil
development  and  exploration  activities  in Tunisia.  As of December 31, 2004,
approximately  12 percent,  two percent and one percent of the Company's  proved
reserves are located in Argentina, Canada and Africa, respectively.

     Argentina.  The  Company's  Argentine  production  during  the  year  ended
December 31, 2004 averaged 30.4 MBOE per day, or approximately 17 percent of the
Company's equivalent production.  The Company's operated production in Argentina
is  concentrated in the Neuquen Basin which is located about 925 miles southwest
of Buenos Aires and to the east of the Andes Mountains. Oil and gas are produced
primarily  from the Al Norte de la Dorsal,  the Al Sur de la Dorsal,  the Dadin,
the  Loma  Negra - Ni,  the Dos  Hermanas,  the  Anticlinal  Campamento  and the
Estacion  Fernandez  Oro  blocks,  each of which the  Company  has a 100 percent
working interest. Most of the gas produced from these blocks is processed in the
Company's Loma Negra gas processing  plant.  The Company also operates and has a
50 percent  working  interest in the Lago Fuego field which is located in Tierra
del Fuego, an island in the extreme southern portion of Argentina, approximately
1,500 miles south of Buenos Aires.

     Most of the  Company's  non-operated  production in Argentina is located in
Tierra del Fuego where oil, gas and NGLs are produced  from six separate  fields
in which the Company has a 35 percent working  interest.  The Company also has a
14.4 percent working  interest in the Confluencia  field which is located in the
Neuquen Basin.

     During the year ended  December  31,  2004,  the  Company  expended  $102.5
million on Argentine development and exploration activities. The Company drilled
44 development wells and 31 extension/exploratory wells, of which 43 development
wells and 21  extension/exploratory  wells were  successful.  During  2004,  the
Company shot seismic covering  approximately 330,000 acres. The Company plans to
be more active in Argentina  in 2005 with $133 million  budgeted for oil and gas
development and exploration activities.

     Canada. The Company's  Canadian producing  properties are located primarily
in  Alberta  and  British  Columbia,  Canada.  Production  during the year ended
December 31, 2004  averaged 8.0 MBOE per day, or  approximately  four percent of
the  Company's  equivalent  production.  The  Company  continues  to  focus  its
traditional conventional  development, exploration and acquisition activities in








the core  areas  of  northeast  British  Columbia  and  southern  Alberta  while
expanding  these  activities  to include a CBM focus in  southern  Alberta.  The
Canadian assets are geographically  concentrated,  predominately shallow gas and
primarily  operated by the Company in the  following  areas:  Chinchaga,  Martin
Creek, Lookout Butte and Carbon.

     Production  from  the  Chinchaga  area of  northeast  British  Columbia  is
relatively dry gas from  formation  depths  averaging  3,400 feet. In the Martin
Creek area of British Columbia the production is relatively dry gas from various
reservoirs ranging from 3,700 to 4,300 feet. The Lookout Butte area in southwest
Alberta  produces  gas and  condensate  from  the  Mississippian  Turner  Valley
formation at approximately 12,000 feet. The Carbon area in south central Alberta
produces  gas,  CBM,  condensate  and  minor  oil from  Cretaceous  to  Devonian
formations at depths ranging from 400 to 6,500 feet.

     During the year ended  December  31,  2004,  the  Company  expended  $120.6
million  (approximately  $56.4 million  associated with the Evergreen merger) on
Canadian  exploration,  development  and  acquisition  activities.  The  Company
drilled three development wells and 51 exploratory/extension wells, primarily in
the Chinchaga,  Martin Creek and Carbon areas,  of which all three  developments
wells and 27 exploratory/extension  wells were successful. The majority of these
wells were  drilled in the  Chinchaga  and Martin  Creek areas  during the first
quarter  of 2004 as these  areas are only  accessible  for  drilling  during the
winter  months.  The remainder of these wells were drilled during the summer and
fall in the Carbon area that is accessible for  operations  throughout the year.
The  Company  plans to  spend  approximately  $60  million  on oil,  gas and CBM
development and exploration opportunities in Canada during 2005.

     The Company  previously  announced  its  intention  to divest of its Martin
Creek and Lookout Butte assets in 2005.  The  expectation is that sales proceeds
will exceed $100 million based on today's commodity price environment,  however,
no assurance  can be given that  purchasers  will bid for these assets at prices
that are acceptable to the Company.

     Africa.  In Africa,  the Company has entered into agreements to explore for
oil and gas in South Africa,  Equatorial Guinea,  Gabon and Tunisia. The amended
South African  agreements cover over five million acres along the southern coast
of South  Africa,  generally  in water  depths  less  than 650  feet.  The Gabon
agreement covers 313,937 acres off the coast of Gabon, generally in water depths
less  than 100  feet.  The  Tunisian  agreements  can be  separated  into  three
categories:  (i) three  permits  covering  2.9  million  acres which the Company
operates with an average 55 percent working interest, (ii) the Anadarko-operated
Anaguid and Jenein Nord  permits  covering  over 1.5 million  acres in which the
Company  has a 45  percent  working  interest  and (iii) the  ENI-operated  Adam
Concession and Borj El Khadra permit  covering  212,420 acres and 969,755 acres,
respectively,  in which the  Company  has a 28 percent  and 40  percent  working
interest,  respectively.  All permits are onshore southern  Tunisia.  During the
year ended December 31, 2004, the Company expended $74.9 million of acquisition,
development and exploration drilling and seismic capital in South Africa, Gabon,
Equatorial Guinea, Tunisia and other prospective areas.

     South Africa. The Company spent $9.5 million of capital associated with its
Petro SA-operated Sable oil field. The Sable oil field began producing in August
2003. The Company has a 40 percent working interest in the Sable field. In 2005,
the Company  currently plans to spend  approximately  $1 million in South Africa
for production enhancement opportunities at Sable.

     In 2005, the Company expects its South African gas project to be sanctioned
by all parties. If approved, this project will allow the Company to sell its gas
from the Sable field and provide  commercialization  opportunities  for previous
gas discoveries.

     Equatorial  Guinea.  The Company  spent $13.0  million of  acquisition  and
drilling capital during 2004 to acquire a 50 percent working interest in 244,881
acres of Block H offshore  Equatorial  Guinea.  The Bravo 1 well was  drilled in
June 2004 and  determined  to be  noncommercial.  The Company has several  other
prospects  on the block that are being  evaluated  for future  drilling,  one of
which is expected to be drilled during 2005.

     Gabon. The Company spent $20.7 million of capital during 2004 to drill five
exploration  wells,  one of which  was  initially  evaluated  as  successful  in
extending the planned  development  area to the south.  The remaining four wells
were unsuccessful.  Despite the successful  extension well, in October 2004, the
Company  canceled  the  development  of the  Olowi  field  due to a  substantial
increase  in  projected  development  costs  which  resulted  in the project not









offering  competitive  returns. The Company's current Gabonese permit expires in
April 2005.  The Company has  verbally  requested  an extension to the permit to
allow more time for the  Company to  determine  the best  manner to exit  Gabon,
however, no assurance can be given that such extension will be granted. In 2004,
the Company recognized an impairment charge of approximately $39.7 million.

     Tunisia.  The Company  spent $17.0  million of  acquisition,  drilling  and
seismic  capital  during the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily to drill one
successful  development well in its Adam oil field,  one successful  development
well in its Hawa oil field and one successful  exploratory well in its Dalia oil
field,  all within the ENI-operated  Adam  Concession.  Production from the Adam
Concession  began  in May  2003.  The  capital  budget  for  Tunisia  in 2005 of
approximately  $24 million  includes an exploration well in the Adam concession,
one exploration well on the  Company-operated El Hamra  permit and two appraisal
wells on the Anaguid permit.

2004 Financial and Operating Performance

     During the years  ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  the  Company
recorded net income of $312.9 million,  $410.6 million and $26.7 million ($2.46,
$3.46 and $.23 per diluted share), respectively. Compared to 2003, the Company's
2004 total revenues and other income increased by $559.4 million, or 43 percent,
including a $558.8 million increase in oil and gas revenues. The increase in oil
and gas revenues was due to increases in production  volumes and increases of 23
percent,  32  percent  and 13  percent  in  average  oil,  NGL and  gas  prices,
respectively, including the effects of commodity price hedges.

     Compared to 2003,  the  Company's  total costs and  expenses  increased  by
$410.9  million,  or 43 percent,  during the year ended  December 31, 2004.  The
increase  in total  costs and  expenses  was  primarily  reflective  of a $184.0
million increase in depletion,  depreciation and amortization  ("DD&A") expense,
primarily driven by increases in depletion  associated with increased production
volumes  from  higher-cost-basis  deepwater  Gulf of  Mexico  and  South  Africa
properties,  a $90.8 million  increase in oil and gas  production  costs,  which
primarily  resulted from increases in production  volumes,  the strengthening of
both the Argentine peso and Canadian  dollar and commodity  prices that impacted
variable lease operating expenses and production taxes, a $48.9 million increase
in   exploration   and   abandonments   expense   primarily   due  to  increased
exploration/extension  drilling  in the Gulf of  Mexico,  Argentina,  Canada and
Gabon  and  a  $39.7  million   impairment  charge  on  the  Company's  Gabonese
properties.

     During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company's net cash provided by
operating  activities  increased to $1.1 billion,  as compared to $763.7 million
during 2003 and $332.2 million during 2002. The 45 percent  increase in net cash
provided by operating  activities  during 2004 was primarily due to increases in
production volumes and commodity prices, as discussed above.

     During the year ended  December 31,  2004,  successful  capital  investment
activities   increased  the  Company's  proved  reserves  to  1.0  billion  BOE,
reflecting  the  effects of the  Evergreen  merger,  strategic  acquisitions  of
property  interests in the Company's core operating areas and the Company's 2004
drilling  program.  Costs  incurred for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled
$3.2  billion,   including   $2.6  billion  of  proved  and  unproved   property
acquisitions, $557.2 million of exploration and development drilling and seismic
expenditures and $15.1 million of asset retirement  obligations.  Costs incurred
for the year ended  December  31, 2004  include $2.5 billion of costs to acquire
Evergreen's oil and gas properties.

     See "Results of Operations" and "Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and
Liquidity",  below, for more in- depth  discussions of the Company's oil and gas
producing activities, including discussions pertaining to oil and gas production
volumes,  prices, hedging activities,  costs and expenses,  capital commitments,
capital resources and liquidity.

Evergreen Merger

     On September 28, 2004, Pioneer completed its merger with Evergreen. Pioneer
acquired  the  common  stock  of  Evergreen  for  a  total   purchase  price  of
approximately  $1.8  billion,  which was  comprised  of cash and Pioneer  common
stock. At the merger date,  Evergreen's proved reserves were approximately 262.2
MMBOE.  Evergreen  was a  publicly-  traded  independent  oil  and  gas  company
primarily engaged in the production, development, exploration and acquisition of
North American  unconventional gas. Evergreen was based in Denver,  Colorado and
was  one  of the  leading  developers  of CBM  reserves  in the  United  States.
Evergreen's  operations were principally focused on developing and expanding its
CBM gas field located in the Raton Basin in southern  Colorado.  Evergreen  also
had  operations in the Piceance  Basin in western  Colorado,  the Uinta Basin in

Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" for more information regarding the Evergreen merger.

2005 Outlook and Activities

     Volumetric  production payments.  During January 2005, the Company sold two
percent of its total proved reserves, or 20.5 million BOE of proved reserves, by
means of two volumetric  production payments ("VPPs") for total proceeds of $593
million and the assumption of the Company's obligations under certain derivative
hedge  agreements.  Proceeds  from  the  VPPs  were  initially  used to pay down
indebtedness.







     The VPPs represent limited term overriding royalty interests in oil and gas
reserves which: (i) entitle the purchaser to receive  production  volumes over a
period of time from  specific  lease  interests;  (ii) are free and clear of all
associated  future  production  costs  and  capital   expenditures;   (iii)  are
nonrecourse to the Company (i.e., the purchaser's only recourse is to the assets
acquired);  (iv) transfers  title to the purchaser and (v) allows the Company to
retain the assets after the VPP's volumetric obligations have been satisfied.

     The first VPP sells 58 Bcf of Hugoton  field gas  volumes  over an expected
five-year  term  beginning in February  2005 for $275  million of proceeds.  The
second VPP sells 10.8 MMBOE of  Spraberry  field oil  volumes  over an  expected
seven-year term beginning in January 2006 for $318 million of proceeds.

     A VPP is  considered  a sale of  proved  reserves  and the  related  future
production of those proved reserves. As a result the Company will (i) remove the
proved  reserves  associated  with the VPPs;  (ii) recognize the VPP proceeds as
deferred revenue which will be amortized on a unit-of-production basis to future
oil and gas revenues over the terms of the VPPs; (iii) retain responsibility for
100 percent of the  production  costs and capital costs related to VPP interests
and  (iv) no  longer  recognize  production  associated  with  the VPP  volumes,
resulting in higher future  revenue per BOE,  production  costs per BOE and DD&A
per BOE ratios.

     The Company  will  amortize to oil and gas  revenues  $62.9  million of net
deferred gas revenue during 2005  associated  with the Hugoton field VPP. During
2006,  the Company  will  amortize  $57.6  million of net  deferred  gas revenue
associated  with the Hugoton  field VPP and $53.7  million of net  deferred  oil
revenue associated with the Spraberry field VPP.

     Commodity prices. World oil prices increased during the year ended December
31, 2004 in  response to  political  unrest and supply  disruptions  in Iraq and
Venezuela as well as other supply and demand factors.  North American gas prices
also  increased  during 2004 in response to continued  strong  supply and demand
fundamentals.  The Company's  outlook for 2005 commodity  prices continues to be
cautiously  optimistic.  Significant  factors  that will impact  2005  commodity
prices include developments in Iraq and other Middle East countries,  the extent
to which members of the OPEC and other oil exporting  nations are able to manage
oil supply through export quotas and variations in key North American gas supply
and demand indicators.  Pioneer will continue to strategically hedge oil and gas
price risk to mitigate  the impact of price  volatility  on its oil, NGL and gas
revenues.

     See Note K of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item
8. Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for  additional  information
regarding the Company's commodity hedge positions at December 31, 2004. Also see
"Item 7A.  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  About  Market  Risk" for
disclosures  about  the  Company's   commodity  related   derivative   financial
instruments.

     Capital  expenditures.  During 2005,  the Company's  budget for oil and gas
capital  activities is expected to range from $900 million to $950  million,  of
which approximately 75 percent has been budgeted for lower-risk  development and
extension   drilling  and  facility   costs  and  25  percent  for   exploration
expenditures.  The Company's 2005 capital budget is allocated  approximately  75
percent to the United  States,  15 percent to Argentina and five percent to each
of Africa and Canada. Pioneer expects to drill approximately 800 exploration and
development  wells during  2005.  During 2005 and 2006,  the Company  expects to
expend approximately $394 million and $348 million, respectively, of capital for
development  drilling  and  facility  costs  related to its  proved  undeveloped
reserves.

     Production  growth.  The Company  expects  that its annual  2005  worldwide
production  will range from 70 MMBOE to 74 MMBOE, or  approximately  192 MBOE to
203 MBOE per day. The forecasted  range includes a full year of production  from
the assets  acquired  in the  Evergreen  merger and has been  reduced by the VPP
volumes sold during January 2005. The Company  expects,  based on quoted futures
prices,  to generate cash flow  significantly  in excess of its capital  program
which will  further  enhance the  Company's  financial  flexibility  to fund the
development  of  future  exploration  successes,   core  area  acquisitions  and
additional development drilling.

     With several discoveries in various stages of commercialization, a pipeline
of   exploration   opportunities,   the  potential   for  continued   core  area
acquisitions,  continuing  strong commodity  prices and significant  excess cash
flow, Pioneer has targeted five-year average compounded annual production growth
of eight percent to nine percent or ten percent per share, giving  consideration
to contemplated share repurchases.







     Costs and  expenses.  The Company  expects that its costs and expenses that
are highly  correlated with  production  volumes,  such as production  costs and
depletion  expense,  will  increase  in  absolute  amounts  during 2005 and that
production  costs,  depreciation,  depletion and amortization  expense and other
costs and expenses  will  increase on a per BOE basis as a result of the sale of
proved  reserves  through  the VPPs.  Additionally,  the  Company  expects  that
depletion  expense  will  increase on a per BOE basis during 2005 as compared to
2004  due to  increased  production  from  the  Devils  Tower  oil  field in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the assets  acquired in the Evergreen  merger.  The
per BOE cost  basis of these  fields is higher  than that of  Pioneer's  average
producing  property in 2004. Ad valorem taxes are highly  correlated  with prior
year commodity  prices. As a consequence of increases in oil, NGL and gas prices
during 2004,  ad valorem taxes are expected to be higher in 2005, as compared to
2004.  The Company also  anticipates  an increase in general and  administrative
expenses  during 2005 due to additional  staffing  associated with the Evergreen
merger and anticipated  Company growth,  as well as the amortization of deferred
compensation associated with unvested restricted stock and stock options.

     Capital  allocation.  During  2004,  the  Company  improved  its  financial
position and achieved  investment grade standards.  The Company is now targeting
mid-investment  grade  ratings.  Towards  that end,  the Company  established  a
targeted  range for debt to book  capitalization  of less than 35 percent by the
end of 2005, as further discussed later. During 2004, the Company paid dividends
of $.20 per  common  share in two  semiannual  installments  of $.10 per  common
share, and the Company currently  expects to, as a minimum,  maintain this level
of dividends in 2005.

     During 2005 through  2007,  the Company  anticipates,  based upon  year-end
futures prices, that it will have significant excess cash flow after funding its
typical annual  capital  budgets,  planned  dividends and achieving its leverage
targets.  The Company  considers it a high  priority to utilize a portion of the
excess cash flow to fund the  development  of new  exploration  successes and to
selectively  acquire  additional assets in its core areas. The Company will also
use a portion of the excess  cash flow for share  repurchases,  pursuant  to the
recently approved $300 million stock repurchase program.

     First quarter 2005.  Based on current  estimates,  the Company expects that
first quarter 2005  production will average 175,000 to 190,000 BOE per day. This
range is lower than the fourth quarter average  reflecting the VPP volumes sold,
more days of downtime and a gradual ramp up of production for the Canyon Express
system which has been undergoing  repairs,  the timing of oil cargo shipments in
Tunisia  and South  Africa  which were high during the fourth  quarter,  and the
typical seasonal decline in gas demand during Argentina's summer season.

     First quarter production costs (including  production and ad valorem taxes)
are  expected  to average  $6.00 to $6.50 per BOE based on current  NYMEX  strip
prices for oil and gas. The increase  over the prior  quarter is a result of the
retention of operating  costs  related to the VPP volumes  sold,  an increase in
production  and ad valorem taxes and  additional  workovers  planned  during the
Canadian winter access season.  Production  costs are expected to decline in the
second  quarter of 2005 as lower-cost  volumes resume from the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico and workovers return to more normal levels.  Depreciation,  depletion and
amortization expense is expected to average $8.75 to $9.25 per BOE.

     Total exploration and abandonment  expense is expected to be $80 million to
$110 million.  Several  higher-risk  exploration  wells and significant  seismic
investments are planned during the first quarter,  serving to front-end load the
Company's 2005  exploration  program.  Specifically,  first quarter  exploration
activity is  expected  to include an  appraisal  well to the 2004  Thunder  Hawk
discovery and an exploration well on a Falcon Corridor satellite prospect in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In Alaska, as many as three wells are expected to test
new  exploration  targets and Pioneer plans to shoot seismic over newly acquired
acreage.  One well is planned  in West  Africa and  lower-risk  exploration  and
geologic  and  geophysical  work will also  continue  in  Argentina,  Canada and
Tunisia. General and administrative expense is expected to be $24 million to $26
million.  Interest  expense is expected to be $33  million to $36  million,  and
accretion  of  discount  on  asset  retirement  obligations  is  expected  to be
approximately $2 million to $3 million.

     The  Company's  effective  income  tax rate is  expected  to range  from 36
percent to 39 percent based on current capital  spending  plans,  including cash
income  taxes of $5  million  to $10  million  that are  principally  related to
Argentine and Tunisian income taxes and nominal  alternative  minimum tax in the
U.S. Other than in Argentina and Tunisia,  the Company continues to benefit from
the carryforward of net operating losses and other positive tax attributes.








     Debt  reduction  target.  Although the Evergreen  merger has resulted in an
increase in the Company's ratio of debt to book capitalization,  the Company has
targeted a ratio of debt to book  capitalization  of less than 35 percent by the
end of 2005. To achieve this target, the Company plans to apply a portion of the
proceeds from the 2005 VPPs and the  divestiture of certain  Canadian assets for
expected proceeds of over $100 million to reduce debt. In addition,  the Company
expects cash flows to be  significantly  in excess of the 2005  capital  program
based on current commodity prices which can be used to further reduce debt.

Field Fuel Reporting

     During the fourth  quarter  of 2004,  the  Company  completed  a  voluntary
internal review of the various accounting treatments related to field fuel costs
used by major oil companies and other  independents in order to determine common
industry practice.  The review, in part, was undertaken in response to the large
volume of field fuel usage related to the assets acquired from Evergreen.  Field
fuel is gas consumed to operate field equipment (primarily compressors) prior to
the gas being delivered to a sales point.

     Pioneer has  historically  recorded the value of field fuel as an operating
expense  with an equal  amount  recorded  as oil and gas  revenues,  with no net
income effect.  Pioneer also reflected the volumes associated with field fuel in
gas  production.  This  practice  has been  routinely  discussed by the Company,
especially in relation to the rising value of the fuel used in the field and its
contribution to rising field operating expenses.

     Although  the Company  believes  that its past  treatment of field fuel was
acceptable, the Company changed its reporting of field fuel, no longer recording
it as revenue or expense and not including it as  production.  Pioneer  believes
this presentation is more common in the industry and will provide a better basis
for comparing  Pioneer to other oil and gas companies.  Within this Report,  the
Company has  adjusted  its prior  period  revenues,  production  costs and sales
volumes  to  reflect  the new  method of  reporting  field  fuel.  The change in
reporting field fuel did not change reported net income of the periods presented
since revenues and production costs were changed in equal amounts.

Critical Accounting Estimates

     The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in
this  Report  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  See Note B of  Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for a  comprehensive  discussion of the Company's  significant  accounting
policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules
and  requirements,  the application of which requires  management  judgments and
estimates including,  in certain circumstances,  choices between acceptable GAAP
alternatives.   Following  is  a  discussion  of  the  Company's  most  critical
accounting  estimates,  judgments  and  uncertainties  that are  inherent in the
Company's application of GAAP.

     Accounting  for oil and gas producing  activities.  The  accounting for and
disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the Company's management
to choose between GAAP  alternatives  and to make judgments  about  estimates of
future uncertainties.

     Successful   efforts  method  of  accounting.   The  Company  utilizes  the
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing  activities as
opposed to the alternate  acceptable full cost method.  In general,  the Company
believes that, during periods of active  exploration,  net assets and net income
are  more  conservatively  measured  under  the  successful  efforts  method  of
accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method.
The critical  difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and
the full  cost  method  is as  follows:  under the  successful  efforts  method,
exploratory  dry holes and  geological  and  geophysical  exploration  costs are
charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas,  under
the full cost method of accounting,  such costs and expenses are  capitalized as
assets,  pooled  with the costs of  successful  wells and  charged  against  the
earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During the years
ended  December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002,  the Company  recognized  exploration,
abandonment,  geological  and  geophysical  expense  of $181.7  million,  $132.8
million and $85.9 million, respectively, under the successful efforts method.

     Proved  reserve  estimates.  Estimates  of the  Company's  proved  reserves
included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines.
The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:







       o     the quality and quantity of available data,
       o     the interpretation of that data,
       o     the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and
       o     the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.

     The  Company's  proved  reserve  information  included in this Report as of
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was audited by independent  petroleum engineers
with respect to the  Company's  major  properties  and prepared by the Company's
engineers  with  respect to all other  properties.  Estimates  prepared by third
parties may be higher or lower than those included herein.

     Because  these  estimates  depend  on many  assumptions,  all of which  may
substantially  differ from future  actual  results,  reserve  estimates  will be
different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately  recovered.  In
addition,  results of  drilling,  testing  and  production  after the date of an
estimate  may  justify,  positively  or  negatively,  material  revisions to the
estimate of proved reserves.

     It should not be assumed  that the  present  value of future net cash flows
included in this Report as of December  31, 2004 is the current  market value of
the Company's  estimated proved reserves.  In accordance with SEC  requirements,
the  Company  based the  estimated  present  value of future net cash flows from
proved  reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate.  Actual future
prices and costs may be materially  higher or lower than the prices and costs as
of the date of the estimate.

     The Company's  estimates of proved  reserves  materially  impact  depletion
expense.  If the  estimates of proved  reserves  decline,  the rate at which the
Company  records  depletion  expense will increase,  reducing future net income.
Such a  decline  may  result  from  lower  market  prices,  which  may  make  it
uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline
in proved reserve  estimates may impact the outcome of the Company's  assessment
of its oil and gas producing properties and goodwill for impairment.

     Impairment  of proved  oil and gas  properties.  The  Company  reviews  its
long-lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management  determines
that events or  circumstances  indicate that the recorded  carrying value of the
properties  may  not  be  recoverable.  Management  assesses  whether  or not an
impairment  provision  is necessary  based upon its outlook of future  commodity
prices and net cash  flows  that may be  generated  by the  properties  and if a
significant  downward  revision has occurred to the estimated  proved  reserves.
Proved oil and gas  properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which
depletion of proved properties is calculated.

     Impairment  of unproved  oil and gas  properties.  Management  periodically
assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment, on a project-by-project
basis.  Management's  assessment  of  the  results  of  exploration  activities,
commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion
of such projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions, if any.

     Suspended wells.  The Company suspends the costs of exploratory  wells that
discover  hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential
of the oil and gas  discovery.  The ultimate  disposition of these well costs is
dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development  decisions.
If the  Company  decides  not  to  pursue  additional  appraisal  activities  or
development  of these  fields,  the  costs of these  wells  will be  charged  to
exploration and abandonment expense.

     The Company  generally  does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory
well as an asset  in its  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  for more  than one year
following the completion of drilling unless the  exploratory  well finds oil and
gas reserves in an area  requiring a major capital  expenditure  and both of the
following conditions are met:

       (i)    The well has  found a  sufficient quantity of  reserves to justify
              its  completion  as a  producing  well  if  the  required  capital
              expenditure is made.
       (ii)   Drilling of the  additional  exploratory  wells  is  under  way or
              firmly planned for the near future.

Due to the capital  intensive  nature and the  geographical  location of certain
Alaskan,  deepwater Gulf of Mexico and foreign projects, it may take the Company
longer than one year to  evaluate the  future potential of the exploration  well







and  economics   associated  with  making  a  determination  on  its  commercial
viability.  In these instances,  the projects feasibility is not contingent upon
price  improvements or advances in technology,  but rather the Company's ongoing
efforts  and  expenditures  related to  accurately  predicting  the  hydrocarbon
recoverability  based on well  information,  gaining  access to other  companies
production,  transportation  or processing  facilities  and/or  getting  partner
approval to drill additional  appraisal wells.  These activities are ongoing and
being pursued constantly.  Consequently,  the Company's  assessment of suspended
exploratory  well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well
has found proved  reserves or is  noncommercial  and is impaired.  See Note D of
Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  "Item 8.  Financial
Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for additional  information  regarding the
Company's suspended exploratory well costs.

     Assessments of functional currencies.  Management determines the functional
currencies of the Company's  subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency
of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends
its operating  revenues,  costs and expenses.  The U.S. dollar is the functional
currency of all of the Company's  international  operations  except Canada.  The
assessment of functional  currencies  can have a significant  impact on periodic
results of operations and financial position.

     Argentine   economic  and  currency   measures.   The  accounting  for  and
remeasurement of the Company's  Argentine balance sheets as of December 31, 2004
and 2003 reflect management's assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to
Argentina's  current economic  situation.  The Argentine  economic and political
situation  continues  to evolve and the  Argentine  government  may enact future
regulations or policies that, when finalized and adopted, may materially impact,
among  other  items,  (i) the  realized  prices  the  Company  receives  for the
commodities it produces and sells;  (ii) the timing of  repatriations  of excess
cash flow to the Company's  corporate  headquarters in the United States;  (iii)
the Company's asset valuations;  and (iv)  peso-denominated  monetary assets and
liabilities. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk" and Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item
8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for a  description  of the
assumptions utilized in the preparation of these financial statements.

     Deferred tax asset valuation  allowances.  The Company continually assesses
both positive and negative  evidence to determine whether it is more likely than
not that its  deferred  tax assets will be realized  prior to their  expiration.
Pioneer monitors  Company-specific,  oil and gas industry and worldwide economic
factors and  reassesses  the  likelihood  that the Company's net operating  loss
carryforwards  and other  deferred tax attributes in each  jurisdiction  will be
utilized prior to their  expiration.  There can be no assurances  that facts and
circumstances  will not materially change and require the Company to establish a
United States deferred tax asset valuation  allowance in a future period.  As of
December 31, 2004,  the Company does not believe  there is  sufficient  positive
evidence  to  reverse   its   valuation   allowances   related  to  foreign  tax
jurisdictions.

     Goodwill impairment. The Company will review its goodwill for impairment at
least  annually.  This  requires  the Company to estimate  the fair value of the
assets and  liabilities  of the  reporting  units that have  goodwill.  There is
considerable  judgment involved in estimating fair values,  particularly  proved
reserve estimates as described above.

     Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and
estimates in recording  liabilities  for ongoing  litigation  and  environmental
remediation. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons.
The  costs to  settle  litigation  can vary from  estimates  based on  differing
interpretations  of laws and opinions and  assessments on the amount of damages.
Similarly,  environmental  remediation liabilities are subject to change because
of changes in laws, regulations, additional information obtained relating to the
extent and nature of site  contamination  and improvements in technology.  Under
GAAP, a liability is recorded  for these types of  contingencies  if the Company
determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimated.  See Note J of
Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  "Item 8.  Financial
Statements  and  Supplementary  Data" for additional  information  regarding the
Company's commitments and contingencies.

Results of Operations

     Oil and gas  revenues.  Revenues from oil and gas  operations  totaled $1.8
billion  during 2004, as compared to $1.3 billion during 2003 and $694.4 million
during 2002,  representing a 44 percent  increase from 2003 to 2004. The revenue
increase  from  2003 to 2004  was due to a 21  percent  increase  in  total  BOE
production,  a 23 percent  increase in oil prices,  a 32 percent increase in NGL








prices  and a 13  percent  increase  in gas  prices,  including  the  effects of
commodity price hedges.  The revenue  increase from 2002 to 2003 was due to a 37
percent  increase in BOE production,  a 12 percent  increase in oil prices, a 40
percent  increase  in NGL  prices  and a 49  percent  increase  in  gas  prices,
including the effects of commodity price hedges.

     The following  table provides  average daily sales  volumes,  by geographic
area and in total, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:


     Per BOE average daily  production for 2004 as compared to 2003 increased by
16 percent in the United States,  by 18 percent in Argentina,  by one percent in
Canada and the Company  realized first  production from South Africa and Tunisia
during 2003. The increased  production was  principally  attributable  to a full
year of production from the Falcon area, new production being initiated from the
Harrier,  Raptor and  Tomahawk  fields in the Falcon  area and at Devils  Tower,
fourth  quarter  production  added  from the  Evergreen  merger and to oil sales
having first been  realized  from the  Company's  Tunisian and South African oil
projects during August and October of 2003, respectively.  Argentine oil and gas
sales volumes  increased  during 2004 primarily due to production  volumes being
added  from the  Company's  capital  expenditures  and higher oil and gas demand
during their summer season.

     Per BOE average daily  production for 2003 as compared to 2002 increased by
46 percent in the United  States,  by 18 percent in  Argentina  and the  Company
realized  first  production  from South Africa and Tunisia  during  2003,  while
average daily production for 2003 as compared to 2002 decreased by 13 percent in
Canada due to normal  production  decline  rates.  The increased  production was
principally  attributable  to incremental gas production from the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico Canyon  Express and Falcon area  projects,  initial oil  production in
South Africa and Tunisia and  increased  oil and gas  production  in  Argentina,
offset by normal production declines.







     The following table provides average reported prices, including the results
of hedging  activities,  and average realized  prices,  excluding the results of
hedging  activities,  by  geographic  area and in  total,  for the  years  ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:


     Field fuel.  As  previously  discussed,  the Company  changed its method of
reporting field fuel usage during the fourth quarter of 2004.  Accordingly,  the
gas  revenues,  production  volumes and related per unit measures of all periods
presented  have been  adjusted in  accordance  with the new method of  reporting
field fuel.

     Hedging  activities.  The oil and gas prices that the  Company  reports are
based on the market price received for the  commodities  adjusted by the results
of the Company's cash flow hedging  activities.  The Company utilizes  commodity
swap and collar  contracts in order to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility
on the  commodities the Company  produces and sells,  (ii) support the Company's
annual capital  budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price
risk associated with certain capital projects. The effective portions of changes
in the fair  values of the  Company's  commodity  price  hedges are  deferred as
increases or  decreases to  stockholders'  equity  until the  underlying  hedged
transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective portions of commodity
price hedges add volatility to the Company's reported stockholders' equity until
the  hedge  derivative  matures  or  is  terminated.  See  Note  K of  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data"  for  information  concerning  the  impact  to oil  and gas
revenues  during  the years  ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002 from the
Company's hedging activities, the Company's open hedge positions at December 31,
2004 and  descriptions of the Company's hedge  commodity  derivatives.  Also see
"Item 7A.  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  About  Market  Risk" for
additional   disclosures  about  the  Company's   commodity  related  derivative
financial instruments.







     Argentine   commodity  prices.   During  2002,  the  Argentine   government
implemented a 20 percent tax on oil exports.  During 2002 and 2003,  the Company
exported  approximately  29  percent  and  five  percent,  respectively,  of its
Argentine oil production.  Associated therewith, the Company incurred oil export
taxes of $2.2 million and $1.2 million for 2002 and 2003,  respectively.  During
2004, the Company did not export any of its Argentine oil production. The export
tax has also had the effect of decreasing  internal  Argentine oil revenues (not
only export revenues) by the taxes levied.  The U.S. dollar equivalent value for
domestic  Argentine  oil sales (now paid in pesos) has  generally  moved  toward
parity with the U.S.  dollar-denominated  export values,  net of the export tax.
The adverse impact of this tax has been partially offset by the net cost savings
resulting from the devaluation of the peso on peso-denominated costs.

     In January 2003, at the Argentine  government's  request, oil producers and
refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for certain  domestic sales at $28.50 per
Bbl which  remained in effect  through  April 2004.  The  producers and refiners
further agreed that the difference between the actual price and the capped price
would be payable once actual prices fall below the $28.50 cap.  Subsequently the
terms were modified such that while the $28.50 per Bbl payable cap was in place,
the refiners  would have no  obligation  to pay  producers for sales values that
exceeded  $36.00 per Bbl.  Initially,  the refiners and producers also agreed to
discount U.S. dollar-denominated oil prices at 90 percent prior to converting to
pesos at the current exchange rate for the purpose of invoicing and settling oil
sales to Argentine  refiners.  In May 2004,  refiners and producers  changed the
discount  percentage  from 90 percent for all price levels to 86 percent if West
Texas Intermediate  ("WTI") was equal to or less than $36 per Bbl and 80 percent
if WTI exceeded $36 per Bbl. All the oil prices are adjusted for normal  quality
differentials prior to applying the discount.

     In 2004,  it  appeared  probable  that the price of world oil would  remain
above  the  $28.50  cap  for  the  foreseeable  future.  Given  the  uncertainty
surrounding  the  timing of when  Argentine  producers  could  expect to collect
balances  outstanding from refiners,  the Company ceased recognizing revenue and
began  recording any excess  between the actual sales price  pursuant to its oil
sales  contracts  with  Argentine  refiners  that  were  subject  to  the  price
stabilization  agreement  and the $28.50  price cap as  deferred  revenue in the
balance  sheet.  At December 31, 2004,  the Company had $5.0 million of deferred
revenue  reflected in its balance sheet  associated  with the sales in excess of
the price cap. The decision by Argentine oil producers and refiners to not renew
the price  stability  agreement  beyond  April 30, 2004 does not  terminate  the
obligation of refiners to reimburse producers for balances that accumulated from
January  2003  through  April  2004,  if and when the price of WTI  falls  below
$28.50.

     In May 2004,  the  Argentine  government  increased  the export tax from 20
percent to 25  percent.  This tax is applied on the sales  value  after the tax,
thus,  the net effect of the 20 percent and 25 percent rates is 16.7 percent and
20 percent,  respectively.  In August 2004,  the  Argentine  government  further
increased  the export tax rates for oil  exports.  The export tax now  escalates
from the current 25 percent (20 percent  effective rate) to a maximum rate of 45
percent (31 percent  effective rate) of the realized value for exported  barrels
as WTI prices per barrel increase from less than $32.00 to $45.00 and above. The
export tax is not deducted in the calculation of royalty payments and expires in
February 2007.  Given the number of  governmental  changes during 2004 affecting
the  realized  price  the  Company  receives  for its  oil  sales,  no  specific
predictions can be made about the future of oil prices in Argentina, however, in
the short term, the Company expects  Argentine oil  realizations to be less than
oil realizations in the United States.

     As a result of economic  emergency law enacted by the Argentine  government
in January 2002, the Company's gas prices,  expressed in U.S. dollars, have also
fallen in proportion to the  devaluation  of the Argentine peso since the end of
2001 due to the  pesofication  of  contracts  and  freezing of gas prices at the
wellhead  required by that law.  As a  baseline,  the  Company's  2001  realized
Argentine  gas price was $1.31  per Mcf as  compared  to $.48,  $.56 and $.66 in
2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.

     The   unfavorable  gas  price  has  acted  to  discourage  gas  development
activities  and increased  gas demand.  Without  development  of gas reserves in
Argentina,  supplies of gas in the country have  declined,  while demand for gas
has been  increasing  due to the  resurgence  of the  Argentine  economy and the
higher cost of alternative fuels.  Recently, gas exports to Chile were curtailed
at the  direction of the  Argentine  government  and  Argentina  entered into an
agreement to import gas from Bolivia at prices starting at  approximately  $2.00
per Mcf (at the border),  including  transportation costs. In May 2004, pursuant
to a decree, the Argentine  government  approved measures to permit producers to
renegotiate  gas sales  contracts,  excluding  those  that  could  affect  small
residential customers, in accordance with scheduled price increases specified in
the decree.  The wellhead prices in the decree rise from a current range of $.61
to $.78  per  Mcf to a  range  of $.87 to  $1.04  per Mcf  after  July 1,  2005,
depending  on the  region where  the  gas  is produced.  No  further  gas  price








increases  beyond July 2005 have been allowed for in the current  decree.  Other
than an expectation that gas prices will be permitted to increase gradually over
time, as has already been demonstrated by the governing authorities, no specific
predictions  can be made about the future of gas prices in  Argentina,  however,
the Company expects  Argentine gas realizations to be less than gas realizations
in the United States.

     See "Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About Market Risk"
for further discussion of commodity prices in Argentina.

     Interest and other income.  The Company recorded  interest and other income
totaling $14.1 million,  $12.3 million and $11.2 during the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  The Company's interest and other income
was  comprised  of revenue  that was not  directly  attributable  to oil and gas
producing activities or oil and gas property  divestitures.  See Note N of Notes
to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data" for additional  information regarding interest and other
income.

     Gain on  disposition  of assets.  During the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, the Company completed asset divestitures for net proceeds of $1.7
million, $35.7 million and $118.9 million,  respectively.  Associated therewith,
the  Company  recorded  gains on  disposition  of assets of $39  thousand,  $1.3
million and $4.4 million  during the years ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and
2002, respectively.

     The net cash  proceeds  from  asset  divestitures  during  the years  ended
December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002  were  used,  together  with net cash  flows
provided by operating  activities,  to fund  additions to oil and gas properties
and to  reduce  outstanding  indebtedness.  See Note O of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures.

     Oil and gas production  costs.  The Company  recorded  production  costs of
$345.5  million,  $254.8  million  and $192.1  million  during  the years  ended
December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively.  In general,  lease  operating
expenses  and  workover  expenses  represent  the  components  of  oil  and  gas
production costs over which the Company has management control, while production
taxes and ad valorem  taxes are  directly  related to commodity  price  changes.
Total production costs per BOE increased during the year ended December 31, 2004
by 11 percent as compared to 2003.  The increase in total  production  costs per
BOE during 2004 as compared to 2003 is  primarily  attributable  to increases in
production  volumes and a greater  proportion of those  volumes  coming from the
Sable  oil  field in South  Africa,  the  Devils  Tower oil and gas field in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent,  the new production added with
the Evergreen merger which are higher operating cost properties.

     Total  production  costs per BOE decreased  during 2003 by three percent as
compared to 2002,  primarily  due to decreases  in per BOE ad valorem  taxes and
workover  expenses,  partially  offset by increases  in per BOE lease  operating
expenses and production taxes. The increase in per BOE lease operating  expenses
was due to the strengthening of both the Argentine peso and the Canadian dollar,
Argentine  inflation and higher average  lifting costs incurred on South African
Sable oil field  production,  while the  increase  in per BOE  production  taxes
primarily  resulted  from  increases in North  American gas prices and world oil
prices.  The  decrease  in per BOE ad  valorem  taxes  is  primarily  due to the
incremental  production  from the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico,  Argentina,  South
Africa and Tunisia fields which are not subject to ad valorem taxes.









     The  following  tables  provide  the  components  of  the  Company's  total
production  costs per BOE and total  production costs per BOE by geographic area
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:



     As previously discussed,  the Company changed its method of reporting field
fuel usage during the fourth quarter of 2004. Accordingly,  the production costs
and related per unit  measures of all  presented  periods have been  adjusted in
accordance with the new method of reporting field fuel.

     Depletion,  depreciation and amortization expense. The Company's total DD&A
expense  was $8.56,  $7.09 and $5.39 per BOE for the years  ended  December  31,
2004, 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  Depletion expense, the largest component of
DD&A,  was $8.37,  $6.92 and $5.17 per BOE during the years ended  December  31,
2004, 2003 and 2002,  respectively,  and  depreciation and amortization of other
property  and  equipment  was  $.19,  $.17 and $.22 per BOE  during  each of the
respective  years.  During  2004 and 2003,  the  increase  in per BOE  depletion
expense  was due to a  greater  proportion  of the  Company's  production  being
derived  from  higher  cost-basis  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico  and South  African
developments and downward revisions to proved reserves in Canada in 2003.

     The following table provides  depletion  expense per BOE by geographic area
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:


     Impairment of oil and gas  properties.  The Company  reviews its long-lived
assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or
circumstances  indicate  that the  carrying  value of  those  assets  may not be
recoverable.  During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company  recognized a
noncash  impairment  charge of $39.7 million to reduce the carrying value of its
Gabonese Olowi field assets as  development  of the discovery was canceled.  See
"Critical Accounting Estimates" above and Notes B and T of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for additional information pertaining to the Company's accounting policies
regarding  assessments of impairment  and the Gabonese  Olowi field  impairment,
respectively.







     Exploration,  abandonments,  geological and geophysical costs. Exploration,
abandonments,  geological and geophysical  costs totaled $181.7 million,  $132.8
million and $85.9  million  during the years ended  December 31, 2004,  2003 and
2002,  respectively.  The following table provides the Company's  geological and
geophysical  costs,  exploratory dry hole expense,  lease abandonments and other
exploration  expense by geographic  area for the years ended  December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002:


     The increase in 2004 exploration,  abandonments, geological and geophysical
expense,  as compared to 2003, was primarily due to a $25.5 million  increase in
geological and geophysical expenditures and a $21.9 million increase in dry hole
expense. The increase in geological and geophysical  expenditures during 2004 as
compared to 2003 was primarily  due to  expenditures  supportive of  exploration
activities  in the  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico,  Alaska,  Argentina  and  Africa.
Significant  components of the  Company's dry hole expense  during 2004 included
$27.7 million and $10.5 million on the Company's  deepwater  Gulf of Mexico Juno
and  Myrtle  Beach  prospects,  respectively,  $19.0  million  on the  Company's
Gabonese  Olowi  prospect  and $5.8  million  on the  Company's  Bravo  prospect
offshore  Equatorial Guinea.  During 2004, the Company drilled and evaluated 103
exploration/extension   wells,  58  of  which  were  successfully  completed  as
discoveries.    During   2003,   the   Company    drilled   and   evaluated   87
exploration/extension   wells,  42  of  which  were  successfully  completed  as
discoveries.

     The increase in 2003 exploration,  abandonments, geological and geophysical
expense,  as compared to 2002,  was  primarily due to increased  geological  and
geophysical  expenditures  supportive of  exploration  activities in the Gulf of
Mexico and Alaska and a $24.4 million  increase in exploratory dry hole expense.
The increase in exploratory dry hole expense during 2003 as compared to 2002 was
primarily due to an increase in Canadian  exploratory  drilling  activities  and
three  unsuccessful  wells  drilled in South  Africa and one  unsuccessful  well
drilled in Tunisia.

     General   and   administrative   expenses.   The   Company's   general  and
administrative  expenses  totaled $80.5 million  ($1.20 per BOE),  $60.5 million
($1.10  per BOE) and $48.4  million  ($1.21  per BOE)  during  the  years  ended
December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively.  The increase in general and
administrative  expense  during 2004, as compared to 2003,  was primarily due to
increases in administrative staff, including staff increases associated with the
Evergreen merger,  and  performance-related  compensation  costs,  including the
amortization  of restricted  stock awarded to officers,  directors and employees
during the three years ended December 31, 2004.

     The increase in general and administrative expense during 2003, as compared
to  2002,   was  primarily  due  to  increases  in   administrative   staff  and
performance-related compensation costs, including the amortization of restricted
stock awarded to officers, directors and key employees during 2003 and 2002.

     Accretion  of discount on asset  retirement  obligations.  During the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded  accretion of discount on
asset retirement obligations of $8.2 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The
provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 143, "Accounting









for Asset  Retirement  Obligations"  ("SFAS 143")  require that the accretion of
discount on asset  retirement  obligations  be  classified  in the  consolidated
statement of operations  separate from interest  expense.  Prior to 2003 and the
adoption of SFAS 143,  the  Company  classified  accretion  of discount on asset
retirement  obligations  as a  component  of  interest  expense.  The  Company's
interest  expense  during the year ended December 31, 2002 included $2.6 million
of accretion of discount on asset  retirement  obligations  that was  calculated
prior to the adoption of SFAS 143 based on asset retirement obligations recorded
in purchased business  combinations.  See Notes B and M of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for additional information regarding the Company's adoption of SFAS 143.

     The increase in accretion of discount on asset  retirement  obligations for
2004 as compared to 2003 was  primarily  due to the increase in future  plugging
and  abandonment  obligations  related  to new  wells in the  deepwater  Gulf of
Mexico,  Tunisia and South  Africa and fourth  quarter  accretion of discount on
asset retirement obligations associated with the Evergreen merger.

     Interest  expense.  Interest expense was $103.4 million,  $91.4 million and
$95.8  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and  2002,
respectively,  while  the  weighted  average  interest  rate  on  the  Company's
indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 5.4 percent as compared to
5.3 percent and 5.7  percent  for the years  ended  December  31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively,  taking into account the effect of interest rate derivatives.  The
increase in interest  expense for 2004 as compared to 2003 was  primarily due to
an $8.0 million  decrease in interest rate hedge gains, a $3.4 million  decrease
in capitalized  interest as the Company completed its major development projects
in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa, increased borrowings under the Company's
lines  of  credit,  primarily  as a  result  of the  Evergreen  merger,  and the
assumption of $300 million of notes in connection with the Evergreen merger.

     The decrease in interest expense for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily
due to (i) $4.8  million  of  interest  savings  associated  with the July  2002
repayment of a $45.2 million West Panhandle gas field capital  obligation  which
bore interest at an annual rate of 20 percent;  (ii) $4.1 million of incremental
savings  from the  Company's  interest  rate  hedging  program;  a $2.6  million
decrease in accretion  expense (see  "Accretion of discount on asset  retirement
obligations",  above);  and (iii) lower  underlying  market  interest  rates and
outstanding debt.  Partially  offsetting the decreases in interest expense was a
$6.8 million  decrease in interest  capitalized  during 2003 as compared to 2002
due  to the  completion  of the  Canyon  Express  and  Falcon  area  development
projects.

     During July 2004,  the Company  exchanged  $526.8 million of three existing
series of senior  notes for a like  principal  amount of New Notes and cash.  In
accordance  with GAAP,  the Company  accounted for the debt exchange  during the
third  quarter  of  2004  as a  replacement  of the  exchanged  debt  and  began
amortizing a $109.0 million  payment made in conjunction  with the debt exchange
which  represented  the market value of the exchanged  senior notes in excess of
their stated value, along with the unamortized  carrying values  attributable to
the  issuance  costs,  discounts  and  deferred  hedge  gains and  losses of the
exchanged  debt,  as  adjustments  of interest  expense over the term of the New
Notes.

     See Note F of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about
the Company's long-term debt, the July 2004 note exchange and interest expense.

     Other  expenses.  Other  expenses were $33.7 million  during the year ended
December 31, 2004,  as compared to $21.3  million  during 2003 and $39.6 million
during 2002. See Note P of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included
in  "Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for a  detailed
description of the components included in other expenses.  The increase in other
expense  for  2004  as  compared  to  2003  was  primarily  due  to  incremental
contingency adjustments of $11.8 million. The decrease in other expense for 2003
as compared to 2002 was  primarily  due to a decrease of $20.9 million in losses
on early extinguishment of debt.

     Income tax  provisions  (benefits).  The  Company  recognized  consolidated
income tax provisions of $166.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2004,
consolidated  income tax benefits of $64.4 million during 2003 and  consolidated
income tax provisions of $5.1 million  during 2002.  The Company's  consolidated
income tax  provisions in 2004 were  comprised of a $3.1 million  current United
States federal, state and local tax provisions,  a $22.2 million current foreign
income tax provision,  $143.8 million of deferred United States  federal,  state
and local tax provisions and $2.7 million of deferred foreign tax benefits.








     The  Company's  consolidated  tax benefits in 2003 were  comprised of a $.1
million  current United States federal tax provision,  an $11.1 million  current
foreign income tax provision,  $76.3 million of deferred  United States federal,
state and local tax benefits and $.7 million of deferred foreign tax provisions.
The 2003 deferred United States federal,  state and local tax benefits include a
$197.7 million benefit from the reversal of the Company's  valuation  allowances
against  United  States  deferred tax assets.  The  Company's  consolidated  tax
provision for 2002 was comprised of current  United States state and local taxes
of $.2 million,  current foreign taxes of $2.1 million and deferred  foreign tax
provisions of $2.8 million.

     The Company's  34.7 percent  effective tax rate for the year ended December
31, 2004 is lower than the combined  United States  federal and state  statutory
rate of  approximately  36.5 percent  primarily  due to the deferred tax benefit
recognized associated with the Company's  cancellation of the development of its
Olowi  field in  Gabon.  See  Notes Q and T of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for
a discussion  regarding the Company's reversal of its United States deferred tax
valuation  allowances  during  2003 and the  Company's  decision  to cancel  its
development of the Olowi field in Gabon.

     See  "Critical  Accounting   Estimates"  above  and  Note  Q  of  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data" for  additional  information  regarding  the  Company's tax
position.

     Cumulative  effect of change in accounting  principle.  The Company adopted
the  provisions  of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and  recognized a $15.4  million
benefit from the  cumulative  effect of change in accounting  principle,  net of
$1.3 million of deferred income taxes.

Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity

     Capital  commitments.   The  Company's  primary  needs  for  cash  are  for
exploration,  development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties,  repayment
of  contractual  obligations  and  working  capital  obligations.   Funding  for
exploration,  development  and  acquisitions  of  oil  and  gas  properties  and
repayment  of  contractual  obligations  may be provided by any  combination  of
internally-generated  cash flow,  proceeds from the disposition of non-strategic
assets or  alternative  financing  sources as discussed  in "Capital  resources"
below.  Generally,  funding for the Company's  working  capital  obligations  is
provided by internally-generated cash flows.

     Payments for  acquisitions,  net of cash acquired.  The Company paid $880.4
million  of  cash,  net of $12.1  million  of cash  acquired,  to  complete  the
Evergreen  merger  during 2004.  As noted  above,  the Company also assumed $300
million  principal  amount of Evergreen  notes and other current and  noncurrent
obligations  associated with the Evergreen  merger.  As is further  discussed in
"Financing  activities",  below,  and in Notes C and F of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data", the Company financed the cash costs of the merger with a new $900 million
364-Day Credit Agreement (the "364-Day Credit Agreement").

     Oil and gas properties.  The Company's cash  expenditures  for additions to
oil and gas properties  during the years ended December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002
totaled $615.9  million,  $688.1 million and $614.7 million,  respectively.  The
Company's  2004 and 2003  expenditures  for additions to oil and gas  properties
were internally funded by $1.1 billion and $763.7 million,  respectively, of net
cash provided by operating  activities.  The  Company's  2002  expenditures  for
additions to oil and gas  properties  were funded by $332.2  million of net cash
provided  by  operating   activities,   $118.9  million  of  proceeds  from  the
disposition  of assets and a portion of the  proceeds  from the issuance of 11.5
million shares of the Company's common stock during April 2002.

     The Company strives to maintain its  indebtedness  at reasonable  levels in
order to provide  sufficient  financial  flexibility to take advantage of future
opportunities.  The Company's  capital budget for 2005 is expected to range from
$900 million to $950  million.  The Company  believes  that net cash provided by
operating  activities  during 2005 will be  sufficient  to fund the 2005 capital
expenditures  budget as well as reduce long-term debt to achieve a targeted debt
to book  capitalization  of less than 35  percent  and fund the  Company's  2005
dividends.  For additional  information  regarding the Company's plans for 2005,
see "2005 Outlook and Activities" above.







     Contractual  obligations,  including  off-balance  sheet  obligations.  The
Company's  contractual  obligations  include  long-term debt,  operating leases,
drilling  commitments,  derivative  obligations,  other  liabilities and, during
2005,  the  VPP  obligations.  From  time  to  time,  the  Company  enters  into
off-balance  sheet  arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material
off-balance  sheet  obligations  of the Company.  As of December  31, 2004,  the
material  off-balance  sheet  arrangements and transactions that the Company has
entered  into  include  (i) $57.1  million  of undrawn  letters of credit,  (ii)
operating lease  agreements,  (iii) drilling  commitments  and (iv)  contractual
obligations  for  which  the  ultimate  settlement  amounts  are not  fixed  and
determinable  such as derivative  contracts that are sensitive to future changes
in commodity prices and gas transportation commitments.

     The  following  table  summarizes by period the payments due by the Company
for contractual obligations estimated as of December 31, 2004:


     Capital  resources.  The Company's  primary capital  resources are net cash
provided  by  operating  activities,  proceeds  from  financing  activities  and
proceeds  from sales of  non-strategic  assets.  The Company  expects that these
resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments in 2005.

     Operating activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities during the
years ended December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002 were $1.1 billion,  $763.7 million
and $332.2 million,  respectively.  Net cash provided by operating activities in
2004 increased by $340.9  million,  or 45 percent,  as compared to that of 2003.
The  increase in 2004 was  primarily  due to  increased  production  volumes and
higher  commodity  prices as compared to 2003.  Net cash  provided by  operating
activities in 2003 increased by $431.4 million,  or 130 percent,  as compared to
that of 2002.  The increase in 2003 was  primarily  due to increased  production
volumes and higher commodity prices as compared to 2002.






     Investing  activities.  Net cash used in  investing  activities  during the
years ended December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002 were $1.5 billion,  $662.3 million
and $508.1 million,  respectively.  The $869.2 million  increase in cash used in
investing activities during 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to $880.4
million paid, net of cash acquired,  in conjunction  with the Evergreen  merger.
The $154.2 million increase in cash used in investing  activities during 2003 as
compared to 2002 was primarily  due to a $73.4 million  increase in additions to
oil  and  gas  properties  and  an  $83.2  million  decrease  in  proceeds  from
disposition  of assets.  The cash proceeds from asset  divestitures  during 2003
were used to reduce  outstanding  indebtedness.  See  "Results  of  Operations",
above,  and Note O of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in
"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information
regarding asset divestitures.

     Financing  activities.  Net cash provided by financing  activities  totaled
$414.3  million and $170.9  million during the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2002,  respectively.   During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2003,  financing
activities  used $91.7 million of net cash. The increase in net cash provided by
financing activities in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to borrowings
on the  Company's  lines of credit to  finance  the cash  consideration  paid in
conjunction  with the  Evergreen  merger offset by excess  operating  cash flows
being used to repay  borrowings on the Company's  lines of credit and the $109.0
million  paid in  conjunction  with the exchange of the  Company's  senior notes
discussed  below.  During 2004,  financing  activities  were comprised of $553.4
million of net principal borrowings on long-term debt, $54.3 million of payments
of other  noncurrent  liabilities,  $26.6  million of  dividends  paid and $92.3
million  of  treasury  stock  purchases,  partially  offset by $35.1  million of
proceeds  from the  exercise  of  long-term  incentive  plan stock  options  and
employee stock purchases.  During 2003,  financing  activities were comprised of
$105.5  million of net principal  payments on long-term  debt,  $14.1 million of
payments of other noncurrent liabilities,  $2.8 million of payments for deferred
loan fees and $2.3  million of treasury  stock  purchases,  partially  offset by
$33.0  million of proceeds from the exercise of long-term  incentive  plan stock
options and employee  stock  purchases.  During 2002,  the  Company's  financing
activities were comprised of $236.0 million of proceeds,  net of issuance costs,
from the sale of 11.5  million  shares  of the  Company's  common  stock;  $48.0
million of net borrowings of long-term  debt; and $14.4 million of proceeds from
the  exercise of  long-term  incentive  plan stock  options and  employee  stock
purchases,  partially  offset by $124.2 million of payments of other  noncurrent
liabilities and $3.3 million of payments for debt issuance costs.

     Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, the Company has entered
into financing  transactions with the intent of reducing its cost of capital and
increasing liquidity through the extension of debt maturities.  During 2004, the
Company accepted  tenders to exchange $117.9 million,  $275.1 million and $133.8
million in principal  amount of its 8 1/4% senior notes due 2007,  9-5/8% senior
notes due 2010 and 7.50% senior notes due 2012 (collectively,  the "Old Notes"),
respectively, for a like principal amount of New Notes and cash. The exchange of
the Old Notes for the New Notes  reduces  the  Company's  future  cash  interest
expense incurred and extended the associated debt maturities.

     During  September  2004,  the  Company  entered  into  the  364-Day  Credit
Agreement that was used to finance the cash  consideration  associated  with the
Evergreen  merger.  Borrowings  under the 364-Day  Credit  Agreement may, at the
option of the Company,  be designated  to bear interest  based on (a) a rate per
annum  equal to the  higher of the  prime  rate  announced  from time to time by
JPMorgan  Chase Bank or the weighted  average of the rates on overnight  Federal
funds  transactions  with members of the Federal  Reserve System during the last
preceding  business  day plus 50  basis  point  or (b) a base  Eurodollar  rate,
substantially  equal  to  LIBOR,  plus a  margin  that is based on a grid of the
Company's  debt  rating  (75 basis  points  per  annum at  December  31,  2004).
Effective  February 4, 2005, the Company  requested that  commitments  under the
364-Day  Credit  Agreement be reduced by $250 million to $650  million.  Also in
connection with the Evergreen merger,  the Company assumed $100 million of 4.75%
Senior Convertible Notes due 2021 (the "Convertible  Notes") and $200 million of
5.875%  Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2012 (the "EVG  5.875%  Notes").  During
October  2004,  the  Company  issued a Notice  of Change  of  Control,  Offer to
Purchase,  and the Consent  Solicitation  Statement (the "Notice") (i) notifying
holders  of the EVG  5.875%  Notes of their  right to  require  the  Company  to
repurchase  their EVG 5.875% Notes pursuant to the terms set forth in the Notice
and (ii) soliciting  consents to proposed  amendments to the indenture governing
the EVG 5.875% Notes (the "Consent Solicitation").  A majority of the holders of
the EVG 5.875% Notes approved the Consent  Solicitation  which had the effect of
(i)  eliminating  the  subordination  of the right of  payment on the EVG 5.875%
Notes, (ii) amending certain restrictive  covenants applicable to the EVG 5.875%
Notes so that  they  are the same as the  restrictive  covenants  governing  the
Company's  other senior notes and (iii) amending  provisions  that suspend other
restrictive covenants when the EVG 5.875% Notes receive certain investment grade
ratings. Associated with the Offer to Purchase, the Company accepted tenders for
and redeemed $5.5 million of the EVG 5.875% Notes.  As a result of the Evergreen
merger,  the Convertible Notes are  redeemable at any  time at the option of the







holders.  If the holders of the Convertible  Notes do not redeem the Convertible
Notes prior to December  20,  2006,  the Company  intends to exercise its rights
under the  indenture  and  redeem the  Convertible  Notes on such date for cash,
common  stock  or  a  combination  thereof.  See  Notes  F  and  K of  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplemental Data" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About
Market Risk" for more  information  about the  Company's  debt  instruments  and
interest rate hedging activities.

     The Company's future debt level is dependent primarily on net cash provided
by  operating  activities,  proceeds  from  financing  activities  and  proceeds
generated  from asset  dispositions.  The Company  believes  it has  substantial
borrowing  capacity,  which has been further  enhanced during 2005 by the use of
the  VPP  net  proceeds  to  reduce  outstanding   indebtedness,   to  meet  any
unanticipated  cash  requirements,  and during low commodity price periods,  the
Company has the  flexibility  to increase  borrowings  and/or modify its capital
spending to meet its  contractual  obligations  and maintain  its debt  ratings.
During 2005,  $131.0 million of the Company's  8-7/8% senior notes due 2005 (the
"8-7/8% Notes") will mature and the 364-Day Credit Agreement will have its first
anniversary.  The Company intends to initially utilize unused borrowing capacity
under its 364-Day  Credit  Agreement  to repay the 8-7/8%  Notes and to transfer
outstanding  borrowings,  if any,  under the  364-Day  Credit  Agreement  to the
Company's Revolving Credit Agreement on its first anniversary.  The Company also
intends to refinance,  under its Revolving Credit Agreement,  the cash component
of a redemption  price  associated with any redemption of the Convertible  Notes
prior to December 2006, should  redemptions  occur.  Accordingly,  the Company's
Consolidated  Balance  Sheet does not reflect any current  portion of  long-term
debt as of December 31, 2004.

     As the Company  pursues its  strategy,  it may  utilize  various  financing
sources,  including  fixed  and  floating  rate  debt,  convertible  securities,
preferred  stock or common  stock.  The  Company  may also issue  securities  in
exchange for oil and gas  properties,  stock or other interests in other oil and
gas  companies  or  related  assets.  Additional  securities  may be of a  class
preferred  to common  stock  with  respect  to such  matters  as  dividends  and
liquidation  rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined
by the Company's board of directors.

     Liquidity.  The Company's  principal source of short-term  liquidity is its
revolving  lines of  credit.  Outstanding  borrowings  under the lines of credit
totaled $828 million as of December 31, 2004. Including $49.3 million of undrawn
and  outstanding  letters of credit  under the lines of credit,  the Company had
$722.7 million of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2004.

     Book capitalization and current ratio. The Company's book capitalization at
December  31,  2004 was $5.2  billion,  consisting  of debt of $2.4  billion and
stockholders' equity of $2.8 billion.  Consequently,  the Company's debt to book
capitalization  decreased to 45.7 percent at December 31, 2004 from 46.9 percent
at December 31, 2003. As more fully  discussed in "2005 Outlook and  Activities"
above, the Company has targeted a range for debt to book  capitalization of less
than 35 percent by the end of 2005.  The  Company's  ratio of current  assets to
current  liabilities was .57 at December 31, 2004 as compared to .48 at December
31, 2003. The  improvement  in the Company's  ratio of current assets to current
liabilities  was  primarily due to increases in oil and gas  receivables  due to
higher commodity prices.

     Debt  ratings.  The Company  receives  debt credit  ratings from Standard &
Poor's  Ratings  Group,  Inc.  ("S&P")  and  Moody's  Investor  Services,   Inc.
("Moody's") and are subject to regular reviews.  The Company's debt is currently
rated  BBB- with a negative  outlook by S&P and Baa3 with a negative  outlook by
Moody's,  both of which are investment- grade ratings.  S&P and Moody's consider
many factors in determining the Company's ratings  including:  production growth
opportunities,  liquidity,  debt levels and asset and reserve mix.  There are no
"ratings  triggers" in any of the Company's  contractual  obligations that would
accelerate the related  scheduled  maturities  should the Company's ratings fall
below  certain  levels.  If the Company were to be  downgraded  by either S&P or
Moody's,  it could  negatively  impact the  interest  rate and fees on  existing
indebtedness  and the Company's  ability to obtain  additional  financing or the
interest rate and fees associated with additional financing.

New Accounting Pronouncement

     On December 16,  2004,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based
Payment"  ("SFAS  123(R)"),  which  is a  revision  of  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation" ("SFAS








123"). SFAS 123(R)  supersedes  Accounting  Principles  Bulletin Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees"  ("APB 25") and amends  Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows". Generally, the
approach  in SFAS  123(R) is  similar  to the  approach  described  in SFAS 123.
However,  SFAS  123(R)  will  require all  share-based  payments  to  employees,
including  grants of employee stock  options,  to be recognized in the Company's
Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based on their fair values.  Pro forma
disclosure is no longer an alternative.

     SFAS 123(R)  must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005 and permits  public
companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:

o    A "modified  prospective"  method in which  compensation cost is recognized
     beginning with the effective date based on the  requirements of SFAS 123(R)
     for all share-based  payments granted after the effective date and based on
     the  requirements  of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to
     the adoption date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the adoption date.
o    A "modified  retrospective"  method which includes the  requirements of the
     modified  prospective  method described above, but also permits entities to
     restate either all prior periods  presented or prior interim periods of the
     year of adoption based on the amounts previously  recognized under SFAS 123
     for purposes of pro forma disclosures.

The Company has elected to adopt the  provisions  of SFAS 123(R) on July 1, 2005
using the modified prospective method.

     As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company  currently  accounts for  share-based
payments to employees using the intrinsic value method  prescribed by APB 25 and
related  interpretations.  As such,  the Company  generally  does not  recognize
compensation expenses associated with employee stock options.  Accordingly,  the
adoption of SFAS 123(R)'s  fair value method could have a significant  impact on
the Company's  future result of  operations,  although it will have no impact on
the Company's overall financial position. Had the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) in
prior  periods,  the impact  would have  approximated  the impact of SFAS 123 as
described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures in Note
B of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in "Item 8. Financial
Statements  and  Supplementary  Data".  The adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have no
effect  on the  Company's  outstanding  restricted  stock  awards.  The  Company
estimates that the adoption of SFAS 123(R),  based on the  outstanding  unvested
stock options at December 31, 2004, will result in future  compensation  charges
to general and administrative  expenses of approximately $1.8 million during the
period from July 1, 2005  through  December  31, 2005,  and  approximately  $1.1
million during 2006.

     The Company has an Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan (the "ESPP") that allows
eligible  employees  to  annually  purchase  the  Company's  common  stock  at a
discount. The provisions of SFAS 123(R) will cause the ESPP to be a compensatory
plan.  However,  the change in accounting for the ESPP is not expected to have a
material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  position,   future  results  of
operations or liquidity.  Historically,  the ESPP compensatory amounts have been
nominal.  See Note H of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in
"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information
regarding the ESPP.

     SFAS  123(R)  also  requires  the tax  benefits  in  excess  of  recognized
compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as required under current  literature.  This requirement may
serve to reduce the Company's  future cash provided by operating  activities and
increase  future  cash  provided  by  financing  activities,  to the  extent  of
associated  tax benefits  that may be realized in the future.  While the Company
cannot  estimate what those  amounts will be in the future  (because they depend
on, among other things,  when employees  exercise stock options),  the amount of
operating cash flows  recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions
were $6.6 million and $14.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003,  respectively.  The Company did not recognize any such tax benefits during
2002.

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The following  quantitative  and qualitative  information is provided about
financial  instruments  to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2004
and 2003,  and from which the  Company  may incur  future  gains or losses  from
changes in market interest rates,  foreign  exchange rates or commodity  prices.









Although  certain  derivative  contracts that the Company was a party to did not
qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial
instruments for trading purposes.

     The fair value of the Company's  derivative  contracts are determined based
on  counterparties'  estimates and valuation models.  The Company did not change
its valuation  method during the year ended December 31, 2004.  During 2004, the
Company was a party to commodity and interest rate swap  contracts and commodity
collar  contracts.  See  Note K of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional
information  regarding the Company's  derivative  contracts,  including deferred
gains  and  losses on  terminated  derivative  contracts.  The  following  table
reconciles  the changes that occurred in the fair values of the  Company's  open
derivative contracts during 2004:


Quantitative Disclosures

     Interest rate sensitivity.  The following tables provide  information about
other financial  instruments  that the Company was a party to as of December 31,
2004 and 2003 and that are or were sensitive to changes in interest  rates.  For
debt obligations,  the tables present maturities by expected maturity dates, the
weighted  average  interest  rates expected to be paid on the debt given current
contractual terms and market conditions and the debt's estimated fair value. For
fixed rate debt, the weighted  average  interest rate represents the contractual
fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003.  For variable rate debt,  the average  interest rate
represents  the  average  rates  being  paid  on  the  debt  projected   forward
proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on January 31, 2005.

     Foreign  exchange  rate  sensitivity.  There  were no  outstanding  foreign
exchange rate hedge derivatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

     Commodity price sensitivity. The following tables provide information about
the Company's oil and gas derivative  financial  instruments that were sensitive
to  changes  in oil and gas  prices as of  December  31,  2004 and  2003.  As of
December  31,  2004  and  2003,  all of the  Company's  oil and  gas  derivative
financial instruments qualified as hedges.

     Commodity hedge  instruments.  The Company hedges commodity price risk with
derivative contracts,  such as swap and collar contracts. Swap contracts provide
a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes.  Collar contracts  provide
minimum ("floor") and maximum  ("ceiling")  prices for the Company on a notional
amount of sales  volumes,  thereby  allowing  some  price  participation  if the
relevant index price closes above the floor price.

     See Notes B, E and K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
in "Item 8. Financial  Statements and  Supplementary  Data" for a description of
the accounting  procedures  followed by the Company relative to hedge derivative
financial  instruments and for specific  information  regarding the terms of the
Company's derivative financial  instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil
and gas prices.

Qualitative Disclosures

     Non-derivative financial instruments. The Company is a borrower under fixed
rate and variable  rate debt  instruments  that give rise to interest rate risk.
The  Company's  objective in borrowing  under fixed or variable  rate debt is to
satisfy capital  requirements  while  minimizing the Company's costs of capital.
See Note F of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in "Item 8.
Financial  Statements and Supplementary  Data" for a discussion of the Company's
debt instruments.

     Derivative  financial  instruments.  The Company  utilizes  interest  rate,
foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to hedge interest
rate,  foreign  exchange  rate and  commodity  price  risks in  accordance  with
policies  and  guidelines  approved  by the  Company's  board of  directors.  In
accordance  with  those  policies  and  guidelines,   the  Company's   executive
management determines the appropriate timing and extent of hedge transactions.

     Foreign  currency,  operations  and price risk.  International  investments
represent,  and are expected to continue to represent,  a significant portion of
the Company's total assets.  Pioneer currently has  international  operations in
Africa,  Argentina and Canada,  which represent nine,  seven and five percent of
the Company's 2004  revenues,  respectively.  Pioneer  continues to identify and
evaluate  other  international  opportunities.  As  a  result  of  such  foreign
operations,  Pioneer's  financial  results  could be affected by factors such as
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, weak economic  conditions or changes
in political climates in these foreign countries.

     The  Company's  international  operations  may  be  adversely  affected  by
political  and  economic  instability,  changes  in  the  legal  and  regulatory
environment and other factors. For example:

       o  local political  and economic  developments could restrict or increase
          the cost of Pioneer's foreign operations,
       o  exchange controls and currency fluctuations  could result in financial
          losses,
       o  royalty and tax increases and  retroactive tax  claims could  increase
          costs of Pioneer's foreign operations,
       o  expropriation  of  the  Company's  property  could  result  in loss of
          revenue, property and equipment,
       o  civil  uprising,  riots,  terrorist  attacks and  wars  could  make it
          impractical to  continue operations,  resulting  in financial  losses,
       o  import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could
          result in loss of revenues,
       o  repatriation   levels  for   export  revenues   could   restrict   the
          availability of cash to  fund operations  outside a particular foreign
          country and
       o  laws and policies of the  U.S. affecting  foreign trade,  taxation and
          investment could restrict Pioneer's ability to fund foreign operations
          or may make foreign operations more costly.

     Pioneer does not  currently  maintain  political  risk  insurance.  Pioneer
evaluates  on  a  country-by-country  basis  whether  obtaining  political  risk
coverage is  necessary  and may add such  insurance in the future if the Company
believes it is prudent.

     Africa.  Pioneer's operations in Africa are in South Africa, Tunisia, Gabon
and  Equatorial  Guinea.  The Company views the operating  environment  in these
African nations as stable and the economic  stability as good.  While the values
of the various African nations'  currencies do fluctuate in relation to the U.S.
dollar,  the Company  believes that any currency risk  associated with Pioneer's
African  operations would not have a material impact on the Company's results of
operations  given that such  operations are closely tied to oil prices which are
denominated in U.S. dollars.

     Argentina.  During the decade of the 1990s,  Argentina's government pursued
free market  policies,  including the  privatization  of state-owned  companies,
deregulation of the oil and gas industry,  tax reforms to equalize tax rates for
domestic and foreign investors, liberalization of import and export laws and the
lifting of exchange  controls.  The  cornerstone  of these  reforms was the 1991
convertibility  law that  established  an exchange rate of one Argentine peso to
one U.S. dollar.  These policies were successful as evidenced by the elimination
of inflation  and  substantial  economic  growth  during the early to mid-1990s.
However,  throughout the decade, the Argentine  government failed to balance its
fiscal budget, incurring repeated significant fiscal deficits that by the end of
2001 resulted in the accumulation of $130 billion of debt.









     During 2001,  Argentina found itself in a critical economic  situation with
the combination of high levels of external indebtedness, a financial and banking
system in crisis,  a country  risk  rating that had  reached  levels  beyond the
historical norm, a high level of unemployment  and an economic  contraction that
had lasted four years.

     Late in 2001, the country was unable to obtain additional  funding from the
International  Monetary  Fund.  Economic  instability  increased,  resulting  in
substantial  withdrawals of cash from the Argentine  banking system over a short
period of time. The government was forced to implement monetary restrictions and
placed  limitations  on the  transfer  of funds out of the  country  without the
authorization of the Central Bank of the Republic of Argentina.  President De la
Rua and his entire  administration  were  forced to resign in the face of public
dissatisfaction.  After his  resignation in December 2001,  there was, for a few
weeks,  a  revolving  door of  presidents  that  were  appointed  to  office  by
Argentina's Congress, but quickly resigned in reaction to public outcry. Eduardo
Duhalde was  appointed  President  of  Argentina  in January 2002 to hold office
until the 2003 Presidential election.

     In January  2002,  the  government  defaulted on a  significant  portion of
Argentina's $130 billion of debt and the national  Congress passed Emergency Law
25,561,   which,  among  other  things,   overturned  the  long  standing,   but
unsustainable,  convertibility  plan. The government  adopted a floating rate of
exchange in February 2002. Two specific provisions of the Emergency Law directly
impact  the  Company.  First,  a tax on the  value of  hydrocarbon  exports  was
established  effective  March 1, 2002. The second  provision was the requirement
that domestic commercial transactions, or contracts, for sales in Argentina that
were  previously  denominated  in U.S.  dollars  be  converted  to pesos  (i.e.,
pesofication)  at an exchange rate to be negotiated  between sellers and buyers.
Furthermore, the government placed a price freeze on gas prices at the wellhead.
With the price of gas pesofied and frozen, the U.S.  dollar-equivalent  price of
gas in Argentina fell in direct proportion to the level of devaluation.

     The  abandonment of the  convertibility  plan and the decision to allow the
peso  to  float  in  international  exchange  markets  resulted  in  significant
devaluation of the peso. By September 30, 2002, the peso-to-U.S. dollar exchange
rate had  increased  from 1:1 to  3.74:1.  However,  since  the end of the third
quarter  of 2002,  Argentina's  economy  has shown  signs of  stabilization.  At
December 31, 2004, the peso-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate was 2.98:1.

     In Argentina,  unlike  Pioneer's  other  operating  areas,  there have been
significant factors that have kept the commodity prices, in general, below those
of the world markets and may continue to do so. The following is a discussion of
the matters affecting Argentine commodity prices:

       o   Oil Prices - In January 2002,  the Argentine  government devalued the
           peso and  enacted an  emergency law that,  in part,  required certain
           contracts that were previously payable  in U.S. dollars to be payable
           in pesos.  Subsequently,  in February 2002,  the Argentine government
           announced a 20  percent tax on oil exports,  effective March 1, 2002.
           The tax is limited  by law to a term of no more than five years.  The
           export tax  is not  deducted in the calculation of  royalty payments.
           Domestic Argentine oil sales,  while valued in U.S. dollars,  are now
           being paid in pesos.  Export oil sales continue to be valued and paid
           in U.S. dollars.

           In January 2003, at the Argentine government's request, oil producers
           and refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for certain domestic sales
           at $28.50 per  Bbl which remained in  effect through April 2004.  The
           producers and refiners further agreed that the difference between the
           actual price and the capped price would be payable once actual prices
           fall below the $28.50 cap.  Subsequently the terms were modified such
           that while  the $28.50 per Bbl payable cap was in place, the refiners
           would have  no obligation  to pay  producers  for  sales values  that
           exceeded $36.00 per Bbl.  Initially, the refiners and  producers also
           agreed to discount  U.S. dollar-denominated  oil prices at 90 percent
           prior  to converting to  pesos at  the current  exchange rate for the
           purpose of invoicing and settling oil sales to Argentine refiners. In
           May 2004, refiners and producers changed the discount percentage from
           90 percent for all price levels  to 86 percent if WTI was equal to or
           less than $36 per Bbl and 80 percent if WTI exceeded $36 per Bbl. All
           the oil prices are adjusted for normal quality differentials prior to
           applying the discount.

           In May 2004,  the Argentine government  increased the export tax from
           20 percent  to 25 percent.  This tax  is applied  on the  sales value
           after the tax,  thus, the net effect of the 20 percent and 25 percent
           rates is 16.7 percent and 20 percent,  respectively.  In August 2004,
           the Argentine  government further  increased the export tax rates for
           oil exports. The export tax now escalates from the current 25 percent









           (20 percent  effective rate)  to a  maximum  rate of  45 percent  (31
           percent effective rate) of the realized value for exported barrels as
           WTI prices per barrel increase from less than $32.00 to $45.00 and
           above.

           During 2002 and 2003,  the Company  exported approximately 29 percent
           and five percent,  respectively,  of its  Argentine  oil  production.
           Associated therewith,  the Company incurred  oil export taxes of $2.2
           million and  $1.2 million for  2002  and 2003,  respectively.  During
           2004, the Company did not export any of its Argentine oil production.
           As noted above, the export tax has also  had the effect of decreasing
           internal  Argentine  oil revenues  (not only export revenues)  by the
           taxes levied. The U.S. dollar equivalent value for domestic Argentine
           oil  sales  has  generally  moved   toward  parity   with  the   U.S.
           dollar-denominated export values,  net of the export tax. The adverse
           impact of this tax has  been partially offset by the net cost savings
           resulting from the  devaluation of the peso on peso-denominated costs
           such as labor.  Given the number of governmental  changes during 2004
           affecting the realized price the Company receives  for its oil sales,
           no specific predictions can be made about the future of oil prices in
           Argentina, however, in the short term, the Company  expects Argentine
           oil  realizations to  be less   than oil  realizations in  the United
           States.

       o   Gas Prices - The  Company  sells  its  gas  to  Argentine   customers
           pursuant   to   (a)   peso-denominated   contracts,   (b)   long-term
           dollar-denominated contracts  and (c) spot market sales.  As a result
           of economic  emergency law  enacted by the  Argentine  government  in
           January 2002,  the Company's gas prices,  expressed in U.S.  dollars,
           have fallen  in proportion  to the  devaluation of the Argentine peso
           since the end of 2001  due to the  pesofication of  contracts and the
           freezing of  gas prices at  the wellhead  required by that law.  As a
           baseline,  the Company's 2001 realized gas price was $1.31 per Mcf as
           compared to $.48, $.56 and $.66 in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.

           The unfavorable  gas price  has acted  to discourage  gas development
           activities and  increased  gas  demand.  Without  development  of gas
           reserves in Argentina, supplies  of gas in the country have declined,
           while demand for gas has been increasing due to the resurgence of the
           Argentine economy and the higher cost of alternative fuels. Recently,
           gas exports to Chile were curtailed at the direction of the Argentine
           government and Argentina entered into an agreement to import gas from
           Bolivia at  prices  starting at  approximately  $2.00 per Mcf (at the
           border), including transportation costs.  In May 2004,  pursuant to a
           decree,   the  Argentine  government  approved   measures  to  permit
           producers  to renegotiate  gas  sales contracts, excluding those that
           could   affect  small  residential  customers,   in  accordance  with
           scheduled  price  increases  specified  in  the decree.  The wellhead
           prices in  the decree rise  from a current  range of $.61 to $.78 per
           Mcf to a range of $.87 to $1.04 per Mcf after July 2005, depending on
           the region  where the gas is produced. No further gas price increases
           beyond July 2005  have been allowed for in the current decree.  Other
           than an  expectation that gas prices  will be  permitted to  increase
           gradually  over  time,  as  has  already  been  demonstrated  by  the
           governing authorities,  no specific predictions can be made about the
           future of gas  prices in  Argentina,  however,  the  Company  expects
           Argentine gas realizations to be less  than gas  realizations  in the
           United States.

     Canada. The Company views the operating environment in Canada as stable and
the economic stability as good. A portion of the Company's Canadian revenues and
substantially  all of its costs are denominated in Canadian  dollars.  While the
value of the Canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar,  the
Company believes that any currency risk associated with its Canadian  operations
would not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.

     As of December 31, 2004, the Company's  primary risk  exposures  associated
with  financial  instruments  to which it is a party  include  oil and gas price
volatility,  volatility  in the  exchange  rates  of  the  Canadian  dollar  and
Argentine  peso vis a vis the U.S.  dollar and  interest  rate  volatility.  The
Company's primary risk exposures associated with financial  instruments have not
changed significantly since December 31, 2004.

                                 ACCOUNTING FIRM



The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Pioneer Natural Resources Company:

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Pioneer
Natural  Resources  Company and subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31,
2004  and  2003,  and  the  related   consolidated   statements  of  operations,
stockholders' equity, cash flows and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004.  These  financial  statements
are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our  responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We  conducted  our audits in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial  statements.  An audit also  includes  assessing  the  accounting
principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
the Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated
results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S.  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

     We also have  audited,  in  accordance  with the  standards  of the  Public
Company  Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the  effectiveness of the
Company's  internal  control over  financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 17, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

     As discussed in Note B to the consolidated  financial  statements,  in 2003
the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 143,
"Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations."

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002



NOTE A.     Organization and Nature of Operations

     Pioneer  Natural  Resources  Company  ("Pioneer"  or  the  "Company")  is a
Delaware  corporation  whose  common  stock is listed and traded on the New York
Stock Exchange.  The Company is a large  independent oil and gas exploration and
production  company with  operations in the United  States,  Argentina,  Canada,
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, South Africa and Tunisia.

     On  September  28,  2004,  the Company  completed  a merger with  Evergreen
Resources, Inc. ("Evergreen"),  as set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated May 3, 2004 (the "Merger  Agreement"),  that added to the Company's United
States and Canadian  asset base and expanded its  portfolio of  development  and
exploration   opportunities  in  North  America.   Evergreen's  operations  were
primarily  focused on developing  and expanding its coal bed methane  production
from the Raton Basin in southern Colorado.

     In  accordance  with the  provisions  of Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 141,  "Business  Combinations"  ("SFAS 141"),  the merger has been
accounted for as a purchase of Evergreen by Pioneer. As a result, the historical
financial  statements  for the Company are those of Pioneer,  and the  Company's
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  present the  addition of  Evergreen's  assets and
liabilities as of September 28, 2004. The accompanying  Consolidated  Statements
of Operations  and  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows include the financial
results  of  Evergreen  since  October  1,  2004.  See  Note  C  for  additional
information regarding the Evergreen merger.

NOTE B.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     Principles of consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries
since  their  acquisition  or  formation,  and  the  Company's  interest  in the
affiliated  oil and gas  partnerships  for which it serves  as  general  partner
through certain of its wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  The Company  proportionately
consolidates less than 100 percent-owned  affiliate partnerships involved in oil
and gas producing  activities in accordance with industry practice.  The Company
owns less than a 20 percent  interest  in the oil and gas  partnerships  that it
proportionately   consolidates.   All   material   intercompany   balances   and
transactions have been eliminated.

     Minority interests. As of December 31, 2004, other liabilities and minority
interests in the Company's  Consolidated  Balance Sheet includes $8.7 million of
minority  interests  attributable  to  outside  ownership  interests  in certain
entities  acquired  in the  Evergreen  merger.  The  minority  interest in these
subsidiaries'  net income for the three months  ended  December 31, 2004 was $.9
million and is included in other expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement
of Operations.

     Investments.  Investments in  unaffiliated  equity  securities  that have a
readily  determinable  fair value are  classified  as  "trading  securities"  if
management's  current  intent is to hold  them for only a short  period of time;
otherwise,  they  are  accounted  for as  "available-for-sale"  securities.  The
Company  reevaluates the  classification  of investments in unaffiliated  equity
securities at each balance sheet date. The carrying value of trading  securities
and available-for-sale  securities are adjusted to fair value as of each balance
sheet date.

     Unrealized  holding gains are recognized for trading securities in interest
and other revenue, and unrealized holding losses are recognized in other expense
during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.

     Unrealized  holding gains and losses are recognized for  available-for-sale
securities as credits or charges to stockholders' equity and other comprehensive
income (loss) during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.







                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002


Realized gains and losses on the  divestiture of  available-for-sale  securities
are determined using the average cost method.  The Company had no investments in
available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2004 or 2003.

     Investments in  unaffiliated  equity  securities that do not have a readily
determinable  fair value are measured at the lower of their original cost or the
net realizable  value of the investment.  The Company had no significant  equity
security  investments that did not have a readily  determinable fair value as of
December 31, 2004 or 2003.

     Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements. Preparation of
the accompanying  consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting periods.  Depletion of oil and gas properties is determined
using estimates of proved oil and gas reserves. There are numerous uncertainties
inherent  in  the  estimation  of  quantities  of  proved  reserves  and  in the
projection  of  future  rates  of  production  and  the  timing  of  development
expenditures.  Similarly,  evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil
and gas  properties  are  subject to  numerous  uncertainties  including,  among
others,  estimates of future  recoverable  reserves;  commodity  price outlooks;
foreign laws,  restrictions  and currency  exchange rates; and export and excise
taxes. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized.

     Argentina  devaluation.  Early in January 2002,  the  Argentine  government
severed the direct  one-to-one U.S. dollar to Argentine peso  relationship  that
had existed for many years.  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,  the Company used
exchange  rates  of 2.98  pesos to $1 and 2.93  pesos  to $1,  respectively,  to
remeasure the peso-denominated  monetary assets and liabilities of the Company's
Argentine subsidiaries.  The remeasurement of the peso-denominated  monetary net
assets of the Company's Argentine subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002  resulted  in a gain of $.2  million  and  charges of $.3  million and $6.9
million, respectively.

     As a result of certain  Argentine  stability laws and  regulations  enacted
since the  devaluation  of the Argentine peso which impact the price the Company
receives for the oil and gas it produces,  the Company  continually  reviews its
Argentine proved and unproved  properties for impairment.  Based on estimates of
future  commodity  prices and  operating  costs,  the Company  believes that the
future  cash  flows  from its oil and gas  assets  will be  sufficient  to fully
recover  its proved  property  basis.  The Company  also plans to  continue  its
exploration  efforts on all of its remaining  unproved  acreage.  Based upon the
Company's improved economic outlook for Argentina, the Company has significantly
increased its capital budget for exploration and development  activities in 2005
as compared to the capital budgets in 2004 and 2003.

     While the Argentine economic and political  situation continues to improve,
the Argentine  government may enact future  regulations  or policies that,  when
finalized  and  adopted,  may  materially  impact,  among other  items,  (i) the
realized prices the Company  receives for the commodities it produces and sells;
(ii) the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the Company's  corporate
headquarters in the United States;  (iii) the Company's asset  valuations;  (iv)
the Company's level of future investments in Argentina; and (v) peso-denominated
monetary  assets and  liabilities.  While  conditions  are  improving,  numerous
uncertainties exist surrounding the ultimate resolution of Argentina's  economic
and political stability.

     Adoption  of SFAS  143.  On  January  1,  2003,  the  Company  adopted  the
provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 143, "Accounting
for Asset Retirement  Obligations"  ("SFAS 143").  SFAS 143 amended Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 19, "Financial  Accounting and Reporting by
Oil and Gas Producing Companies" ("SFAS 19") to require that the fair value of a
liability  for an asset  retirement  obligation  be  recognized in the period in
which it is incurred if a reasonable  estimate of fair value can be made.  Under
the provisions of SFAS 143, asset retirement obligations are capitalized as part
of the carrying value of the long-lived asset.







                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002



     The  adoption of SFAS 143 resulted in a January 1, 2003  cumulative  effect
adjustment  to record a gain of $15.4  million,  net of $1.3 million of deferred
tax, as a cumulative  effect  adjustment of a change in accounting  principle in
the Company's Consolidated  Statements of Operations.  See Note M for additional
information regarding the Company's asset retirement obligations.

     The  following  table  illustrates  the pro forma  effect on net income and
earnings  per share for the years  ended  December  31,  2003 and 2002 as if the
Company had adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2002.


     Cash  equivalents.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  cash on hand and
depository accounts held by banks.

     Inventories - equipment.  Lease and well equipment  inventory to be used in
future joint  operations  activities are carried at the lower of cost or market,
on a first-in,  first-out  basis.  Total lease and well equipment  inventory was
$37.9 million and $15.3 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively,
and is net of valuation reserve  allowances of $.4 million and $.6 million as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     Inventories - commodities.  Commodities are carried at the lower of average
cost or market. When sold from inventory, commodities are removed on a first-in,
first-out basis. Total commodity  inventory was $2.4 million and $2.2 million as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     Oil and gas properties.  The Company utilizes the successful efforts method
of  accounting  for its oil and gas  properties.  Under this  method,  all costs
associated  with  productive  wells  and  nonproductive  development  wells  are
capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological and geophysical
expenditures are expensed.  The Company capitalizes interest on expenditures for
significant  development  projects  until  such  projects  are  ready  for their
intended use.

     The Company  generally  does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory
well as an asset  in its  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  for more  than one year
following the completion of drilling unless the  exploratory  well finds oil and
gas reserves in an area  requiring a major capital  expenditure  and both of the
following conditions are met:

       (i)    The well  has found a  sufficient quantity  of reserves to justify
              its  completion  as  a  producing  well  if the  required  capital
              expenditure is made.
       (ii)   Drilling  of the  additional  exploratory  wells  is under  way or
              firmly planned for the near future.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Due to the capital  intensive  nature and the  geographical  location of certain
Alaskan,  deepwater Gulf of Mexico and foreign projects, it may take the Company
longer than one year to evaluate the future  potential of the  exploration  well
and  economics   associated  with  making  a  determination  on  its  commercial
viability.  In these instances,  the projects feasibility is not contingent upon
price  improvements or advances in technology,  but rather the Company's ongoing
efforts  and  expenditures  related to  accurately  predicting  the  hydrocarbon
recoverability  based on well  information,  gaining  access to other  companies
production,  transportation  or processing  facilities  and/or  getting  partner
approval to drill additional  appraisal wells.  These activities are ongoing and
being pursued constantly.  Consequently,  the Company's  assessment of suspended
exploratory  well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well
has found proved reserves or is  noncommercial  and is impaired.  See Note D for
additional information regarding the Company's suspended exploratory well costs.

     The Company  owns  interests in 11 natural gas  processing  plants and five
treating  facilities.  The  Company  operates  seven of the  plants and all five
treating  facilities.  The  Company's  ownership  in the natural gas  processing
plants  and  treating  facilities  is  primarily  to  accommodate  handling  the
Company's gas  production and thus are considered a component of the capital and
operating costs of the respective  fields that they service.  To the extent that
there is excess capacity at a plant or treating  facility,  the Company attempts
to  process  third  party gas  volumes  for a fee to keep the plant or  treating
facility at capacity.  All  revenues  and expenses  derived from third party gas
volumes  processed  through the plants and treating  facilities  are reported as
components of oil and gas production  costs. The third party revenues  generated
from the plant and treating  facilities  for the three years ended  December 31,
2004,  2003 and 2002 were  $45.9  million,  $39.5  million  and  $28.4  million,
respectively.  The third party expenses  attributable to the plants and treating
facilities for the same respective periods were $11.9 million, $11.3 million and
$9.3 million.  The capitalized  costs of the plants and treating  facilities are
included in proved oil and gas  properties  and are depleted  using the unit-of-
production  method along with the other capitalized costs of the field that they
service.

     Capitalized  costs  relating to proved  properties  are depleted  using the
unit-of-production  method  based  on  proved  reserves.  Costs  of  significant
nonproducing  properties,  wells in the process of being drilled and development
projects are excluded from depletion  until such time as the related  project is
completed and proved reserves are established or, if unsuccessful, impairment is
determined.

     Proceeds from the sales of individual  properties and the capitalized costs
of   individual   properties   sold  or  abandoned  are  credited  and  charged,
respectively,   to  accumulated   depletion,   depreciation  and   amortization.
Generally,  no gain or loss is recognized until the entire  amortization base is
sold.  However,  gain or loss is recognized from the sale of less than an entire
amortization base if the disposition is significant  enough to materially impact
the depletion rate of the remaining properties in the amortization base.

     In accordance  with  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 144,
"Accounting  for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" ("SFAS 144"),
the Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used,  including proved
oil and gas  properties  accounted for under the  successful  efforts  method of
accounting, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
those assets may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is indicated if the sum
of the  expected  future  cash  flows is less  than the  carrying  amount of the
assets. In this circumstance,  the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the
amount by which the  carrying  amount of the asset  exceeds the  estimated  fair
value of the asset.

     Unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment on
a project-by-project basis. The impairment assessment is affected by the results
of exploration  activities,  commodity price  outlooks,  planned future sales or
expiration  of all or a portion of such  projects.  If the quantity of potential
reserves  determined by such  evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the
cost invested in each project,  the Company will recognize an impairment loss at
that time by recording an allowance.

     Goodwill. As is described in Note C, the Company recorded $324.8 million of
goodwill  associated with the Evergreen merger. The goodwill was recorded to the
Company's  United States reporting unit and will be subject to change during the
twelve-month  period  following the merger if the settlement  values of monetary
assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in the  merger  differ  from  their
estimated  values as of September 28, 2004. In accordance  with Emerging  Issues
Task Force ("EITF") Abstract Issue No. 00-23,  "Issues Related to the Accounting
for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44",
the Company  reduced  goodwill by $9.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2004
for tax benefits  associated  with the exercise of  fully-vested  stock  options
assumed  in  conjunction  with  the  Evergreen  merger  to the  extent  that the
stock-based  compensation  expense  reported for tax purposes did not exceed the
fair value of the awards  recognized  as part of the total  purchase  price.  In
accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other  Intangible  Assets",  goodwill is not  amortized  to earnings  but is
assessed  for  impairment   whenever  events  or  circumstances   indicate  that
impairment of the carrying  value of goodwill is likely,  but no less often than
annually.  If the carrying value of goodwill is determined to be impaired, it is
reduced for the impaired value with a corresponding charge to pretax earnings in
the period in which it is determined to be impaired.

     Treasury  stock.  Treasury  stock  purchases  are  recorded  at cost.  Upon
reissuance,  the cost of treasury shares held is reduced by the average purchase
price per share of the aggregate treasury shares held.

     Environmental.  The Company's  environmental  expenditures  are expensed or
capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate
to an  existing  condition  caused  by past  operations  and that have no future
economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend the life of the related
property  or  mitigate  or  prevent  future   environmental   contamination  are
capitalized.  Liabilities  are recorded  when  environmental  assessment  and/or
remediation  is  probable  and  the  costs  can be  reasonably  estimated.  Such
liabilities  are  undiscounted  unless  the  timing  of  cash  payments  for the
liability are fixed or reliably determinable.

     Revenue recognition. The Company does not recognize revenues until they are
realized  or  realizable  and  earned.   Revenues  are  considered  realized  or
realizable and earned when: (i)  persuasive  evidence of an arrangement  exists;
(ii)  delivery has occurred or services have been  rendered;  (iii) the seller's
price  to the  buyer  is  fixed  or  determinable  and  (iv)  collectibility  is
reasonably assured.

     The Company uses the entitlements method of accounting for oil, NGL and gas
revenues.  Sales proceeds in excess of the Company's entitlement are included in
other  liabilities  and the Company's share of sales taken by others is included
in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

     The Company had no oil or natural gas liquid ("NGL")  entitlement assets or
liabilities  as of December 31, 2004 or 2003.  The following  table presents the
Company's gas entitlement assets and liabilities and their associated volumes as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003:


     Derivatives and hedging. The Company follows the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting  Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and  Hedging   Activities"  ("SFAS  133").  SFAS  133  requires  the  accounting
recognition  of all  derivative  instruments  as either assets or liabilities at

                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002


fair value.  Derivative instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair
value  through net income.  Under the  provisions  of SFAS 133,  the Company may
designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair
value  of an asset or a  liability  or an  identified  portion  thereof  that is
attributable  to a  particular  risk (a "fair  value  hedge") or as hedging  the
exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a
particular  risk (a "cash flow hedge").  Both at the inception of a hedge and on
an ongoing basis, a fair value hedge must be expected to be highly  effective in
achieving  offsetting  changes in fair  value  attributable  to the hedged  risk
during the periods that a hedge is designated. Similarly, a cash flow hedge must
be  expected  to  be  highly  effective  in  achieving   offsetting  cash  flows
attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge. The expectation of
hedge  effectiveness  must be supported by matching the  essential  terms of the
hedged  asset,  liability or  forecasted  transaction  to the  derivative  hedge
contract or by effectiveness  assessments  using statistical  measurements.  The
Company's  policy is to assess hedge  effectiveness  at the end of each calendar
quarter.

     Under the  provisions of SFAS 133,  changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments  that are fair value hedges are offset  against  changes in the fair
value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through net income.
Effective changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow
hedges are recognized in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income (loss) - net
deferred  hedge losses,  net of tax in the  stockholders'  equity section of the
Company's  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets until such time as the hedged items are
recognized  in net income.  Ineffective  portions of a  derivative  instrument's
change in fair value are immediately recognized in net income.

     See  Note  K  for  a  description  of  the  specific  types  of  derivative
transactions in which the Company participates.

     Stock-based  compensation.  The Company has a long-term incentive plan (the
"Long-Term   Incentive  Plan")  under  which  the  Company  grants   stock-based
compensation.  The Long-Term  Incentive  Plan is described more fully in Note H.
The Company  accounts for stock-based  compensation  granted under the Long-Term
Incentive  Plan  using the  intrinsic  value  method  prescribed  by  Accounting
Principles  Bulletin Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"
("APB  25")  and  related  interpretations.   Stock-based  compensation  expense
associated  with option grants was not  recognized in the  determination  of the
Company's net income during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, as
all options granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan had exercise prices equal
to the market value of the underlying common stock on the dates of grant or were
issued in exchange for fully-vested  Evergreen options as purchase consideration
in the  Evergreen  merger.  Stock-based  compensation  expense  associated  with
restricted  stock awards is deferred and amortized to earnings  ratably over the
vesting  periods of the awards.  See "New  accounting  pronouncement"  below for
information   regarding  the  Company's   adoption  of  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. 123  (revised  2004),  "Share-Based  Payment"  ("SFAS
123(R)") on July 1, 2005.

     The  following  table  illustrates  the pro forma  effect on net income and
earnings  per share as if the Company  had  applied  the fair value  recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123, "Accounting

the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:


     Foreign currency  translation.  The U.S. dollar is the functional  currency
for all of the Company's  international  operations except Canada.  Accordingly,
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured
to U.S.  dollars  at the  exchange  rate in effect at the end of each  reporting
period;  revenues and costs and expenses  denominated in a foreign  currency are
remeasured  at the average of the exchange  rates that were in effect during the
period  in which  the  revenues  and costs and  expenses  were  recognized.  The
resulting gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency denominated balances
into U.S.  dollars are recorded in other income or other expense,  respectively.
Nonmonetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in a  foreign  currency  are
remeasured at the historic exchange rates that were in effect when the assets or
liabilities were acquired or incurred.

     The  functional  currency  of  the  Company's  Canadian  operations  is the
Canadian dollar. The financial  statements of the Company's Canadian  subsidiary
entities are translated to U.S.  dollars as follows:  all assets and liabilities
are  translated  using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each  reporting
period;  revenues and costs and expenses are translated using the average of the
exchange  rates that were in effect  during the period in which the revenues and
costs  and  expenses  were  recognized.  The  resulting  gains  or  losses  from
translating   non-U.S.   dollar   denominated   balances  are  recorded  in  the
accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Stockholders'  Equity for the period
through accumulated other comprehensive  income (loss) - cumulative  translation
adjustment.

     The  following  table  presents  the exchange  rates used to translate  the
financial  statements of the Company's Canadian  subsidiaries in the preparation
of the consolidated  financial statements as of and for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:


     Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2003 and
2002 amounts in order to conform with the 2004 presentation.  Specifically,  the
Company  reduced oil and gas revenues and production  costs by $40.6 million and
$23.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,  respectively,  to
conform  with its current  treatment  of field fuel.  During  2004,  the Company
changed its  treatment  of field fuel,  which is gas  consumed to operate  field
equipment,  to  exclude  the  field  fuel  gas  from  oil and gas  revenues  and
production costs. The Company also increased oil and gas revenues and production
costs by $15.8 million and $16.2  million for the years ended  December 31, 2003
and 2002,  respectively,  to conform with its current  treatment of Canadian gas
transportation costs. During 2004, the Company changed its treatment of Canadian
gas  transportation  costs to include  these costs as a component of oil and gas
production  costs.  In prior  years,  transportation  costs were  recorded  as a
reduction to oil and gas revenues.

     New  accounting   pronouncement.   On  December  16,  2004,  the  Financial
Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 123(R),  which is a revision of
SFAS 123.  SFAS 123(R)  supersedes  APB 25 and amends  Statement  of  Accounting
Standards  No. 95,  "Statement of Cash Flows".  Generally,  the approach in SFAS
123(R) is similar to the approach  described in SFAS 123.  However,  SFAS 123(R)
will require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock  options,  to be recognized in the  Company's  Consolidated  Statements of
Operations  based on their fair  values.  Pro forma  disclosure  is no longer an
alternative.

     SFAS 123(R)  must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005 and permits  public
companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:

o    A "modified  prospective"  method in which  compensation cost is recognized
     beginning with the effective date based on the  requirements of SFAS 123(R)
     for all share-based  payments  granted after the adoption date and based on
     the  requirements  of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to
     the  effective  date of SFAS 123(R) that  remain  unvested on the  adoption
     date.
o    A "modified  retrospective"  method which includes the  requirements of the
     modified  prospective  method described above, but also permits entities to
     restate either all prior periods  presented or prior interim periods of the
     year of adoption based on the amounts previously  recognized under SFAS 123
     for purposes of pro forma disclosures.

The Company has elected to adopt the  provisions  of SFAS 123(R) on July 1, 2005
using the modified prospective method.

     As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company  currently  accounts for  share-based
payments to employees using the intrinsic value method  prescribed by APB 25 and
related  interpretations.  As such,  the Company  generally  does not  recognize
compensation expenses associated with employee stock options.  Accordingly,  the
adoption of SFAS 123(R)'s  fair value method could have a significant  impact on
the Company's  future result of  operations,  although it will have no impact on
the Company's overall financial position. Had the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) in
prior  periods,  the impact  would have  approximated  the impact of SFAS 123 as
described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures  above.
The  adoption  of SFAS  123(R)  will have no effect  on the  Company's  unvested
outstanding  restricted stock awards. The Company estimates that the adoption of
SFAS 123(R),  based on the  outstanding  unvested  stock options at December 31,
2004, will result in future  compensation  charges to general and administrative

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002


expenses  of  approximately  $1.8  million  during the period  from July 1, 2005
through December 31, 2005, and approximately $1.1 million during 2006.

     The Company has an Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan (the "ESPP") that allows
eligible  employees  to  annually  purchase  the  Company's  common  stock  at a
discount. The provisions of SFAS 123(R) will cause the ESPP to be a compensatory
plan.  However,  the change in accounting for the ESPP is not expected to have a
material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  position,   future  results  of
operations or liquidity.  Historically,  the ESPP compensatory amounts have been
nominal. See Note H for additional information regarding the ESPP.

     SFAS  123(R)  also  requires  the tax  benefits  in  excess  of  recognized
compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as required under current  literature.  This requirement may
serve to reduce the Company's  future cash provided by operating  activities and
increase  future  cash  provided  by  financing  activities,  to the  extent  of
associated  tax benefits  that may be realized in the future.  While the Company
cannot  estimate what those  amounts will be in the future  (because they depend
on, among other things,  when employees  exercise stock options),  the amount of
operating cash flows  recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions
were $6.6 million and $14.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003,  respectively.  The Company did not recognize any such tax benefits during
2002.

NOTE C.     Acquisitions

     Evergreen Merger. On September 28, 2004,  Pioneer completed its merger with
Evergreen with Pioneer being the surviving  corporation for accounting purposes.
The  transaction  was  accounted  for as a purchase of  Evergreen  by Pioneer in
accordance with SFAS 141. The merger with Evergreen was accomplished through the
issuance of 25.4 million  shares of Pioneer  common stock and $851.1  million of
cash paid, net of $12.1 million of acquired cash, to the Evergreen  shareholders
at closing. The value of each share of Pioneer was based on the five-day average
closing price of Pioneer's common stock surrounding the May 3, 2004 announcement
date  of  the  merger,  which  equaled  $32.578  per  share.  In  addition,   as
consideration  for Evergreen's  Kansas assets,  which were sold to a third party
for net proceeds of $20.9 million on September 27, 2004, Evergreen  stockholders
received an additional  cash payment  equal to $.48 per Evergreen  common share.
The cash consideration paid in the merger was financed through borrowings on the
Company's new $900 million 364-day senior  unsecured  revolving  credit facility
(the "364-Day Credit Agreement"). During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
paid $29.3 million of  transaction  costs  associated  with the merger that were
accrued but unpaid on September 28, 2004.

     The following  table  represents the allocation of the total purchase price
of Evergreen to the acquired assets and assumed  liabilities based upon the fair
values  assigned to each of the  significant  assets  acquired  and  liabilities
assumed.  The fair value of the  proved  properties  was based on the  Company's
estimate of the present value of the acquired  proved  reserves.  Likewise,  the
fair value of the  unproved  properties  was  estimated  by  risk-weighting  the
present value of the acquired probable  reserves.  Any future adjustments to the
allocation  of the  purchase  price are not  anticipated  to be  material to the
Company's financial statements.


     Evergreen was a  publicly-traded  independent oil and gas company primarily
engaged in the  production,  development,  exploration  and acquisition of North
American unconventional gas. Evergreen was based in Denver, Colorado and was one
of the leading  developers  of coal bed methane  reserves in the United  States.
Evergreen's  operations were principally focused on developing and expanding its
coal  bed  methane  field  located  in the  Raton  Basin in  southern  Colorado.
Evergreen  also had operations in the Piceance  Basin in western  Colorado,  the
Uinta Basin in eastern Utah and the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin as a result
of Evergreen's acquisition of Carbon Energy Corporation on October 29, 2003 (the
"Carbon acquisition").

     The merger  with  Evergreen  provided  an  opportunity  for the  Company to
rebalance its portfolio of long-lived  foundation  assets by adding  Evergreen's
long-lived onshore producing asset base and significant low-risk development and
extension  drilling  opportunities.  Additionally,  the  Company's  decision  to
complete the merger was  positively  impacted by the  compatible  technical  and
corporate  cultures of Pioneer and Evergreen,  Evergreen's  substantial  acreage
position  in key  growth  basins  of the  United  States  Rockies  area  and the

opportunity to leverage Evergreen's  technical expertise in the area of coal bed
methane operations,  which management believes could have further application in
other areas of the United States.  These strategic  opportunities were among the
factors considered when the Company determined its offering price for Evergreen.

     Included  in working  capital  and other  assets in the table above is $6.4
million of intangible assets attributable to noncompete agreements executed with
three former  executive  officers of  Evergreen,  including  Mr. Mark Sexton,  a
director of the Company  since the merger and  formerly  Evergreen's  President,
Chief Executive  Officer and Chairman of the board of directors.  The noncompete
agreements  are being  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis as  charges  to the
Company's  net income  during the two-year  period  ending  September  28, 2006.
Additionally,  the Company  recorded $324.8 million of goodwill  associated with
the  Evergreen  merger,  which  amount  represents  the  excess of the  purchase
consideration  over the net fair value of the  identifiable net assets acquired.
Based on the  expected  strategic  benefits  of the  Evergreen  merger  that are
expected  to be  realized  on a reporting  unit  basis,  the  goodwill  has been
recorded as an asset of the Company's United States reporting unit. The goodwill
is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The fair values of the
monetary assets acquired and liabilities  assumed is being monitored  during the
twelve-month  period  ending  September  28,  2005 and will be adjusted if their
settlement  values differ from the estimated fair values  assigned to them as of
September  28,  2004.  Forthcoming  adjustments  of the fair values  assigned to
acquired  monetary assets and  liabilities,  if required,  will change the value
assigned to goodwill in the merger.

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data for the
years  ended  December  31,  2004  and 2003  were  derived  from the  historical
financial  statements of Pioneer and Evergreen giving effect to the merger as if
the merger and the Carbon  acquisition had each occurred on January 1, 2003. The
unaudited pro forma  combined  condensed  financial  data have been included for
comparative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the results that
might have occurred had the  transactions  taken place as of the dates indicated
and are not intended to be a projection of future results.

     Falcon  acquisitions.  During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
purchased,  through two transactions,  an additional 30 percent working interest
in the Falcon field  development and a 25 percent working interest in associated
acreage in the deepwater  Gulf of Mexico for a combined  purchase price of $61.1
million.  As a result of these  transactions,  the  Company  owned a 75  percent
working  interest  in and  operated  the Falcon  field  development  and related
exploration  blocks at  December  31,  2002.  On March  28,  2003,  the  Company
purchased the remaining 25 percent working  interest that it did not already own
in the Falcon field,  the Harrier field and surrounding  satellite  prospects in
the deepwater  Gulf of Mexico for $120.4  million,  including  $114.1 million of
cash, $1.7 million of asset retirement  obligations  assumed and $4.6 million of
closing adjustments.

     West Panhandle  acquisitions.  During July 2002, the Company  completed the
purchase  of the  remaining  23 percent of the rights  that the  Company did not
already  own in its core area West  Panhandle  gas  field,  100  percent  of the
related West Panhandle  field  gathering  system and ten blocks  surrounding the
Company's  deepwater Gulf of Mexico Falcon  discovery.  In connection with these
transactions,  the  Company  recorded  $100.4  million  to  proved  oil  and gas
properties,  $3.8 million to unproved oil and gas properties and $1.9 million to
assets held for resale;  retired a capital cost  obligation  for $60.8  million;
settled  a  $20.9   million  gas   balancing   receivable;   assumed  trade  and
environmental  obligations amounting to $5.8 million in the aggregate;  and paid
$140.2 million of cash. The capital cost  obligation  retired by the Company for
$60.8 million  represented  an obligation  for West  Panhandle gas field capital
additions that was not able to be prepaid and bore interest at an annual rate of
20 percent. The portion of the purchase price allocated to the retirement of the
capital cost  obligation  was based on a discounted  cash flow analysis  using a
market  discount  rate for  obligations  with  similar  terms.  The capital cost
obligation had a carrying  value of $45.2 million,  resulting in a loss of $15.6
million from the early extinguishment of this obligation.

     Other acquisitions. During 2004, the Company spent $20.2 million to acquire
various  additional  working  interests in the Spraberry field. The Company also
spent $16.8 million to acquire  acreage in Alaska and $10.5 million in Canada to
acquire  producing  property and  undeveloped  acreage in southern  Alberta.  In
addition  to these  acquisitions,  the Company  spent  $43.2  million to acquire
producing properties in the United States and unproved properties in the Gulf of
Mexico,  Canada and Africa.  During  2003,  in addition  to the  incremental  25
percent  working  interest  acquired in the Falcon area, the Company spent $30.6
million to acquire  producing  properties  in the  Spraberry  field and unproved
properties in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, Argentina,  Canada and Tunisia. During
2002,  in addition  to the Falcon and West  Panhandle  acquisitions  referred to
above, the Company spent $25.5 million to acquire additional unproved acreage in
the United States,  including 34 Gulf of Mexico shelf blocks, six deepwater Gulf
of Mexico blocks,  a 70 percent working interest in ten state leases on Alaska's
North Slope and  property  interests in other areas of the United  States.  Also
during  2002,  the Company  acquired  unproved  and proved oil and gas  property
interests  in Canada for $2.3 million and $.5  million,  respectively,  and $1.8
million of additional unproved property interests in Tunisia.

NOTE D.     Exploratory Well Costs

     The  Company  capitalizes  exploratory  well costs until a decision is made
that the well has found proved  reserves or that it is  impaired,  in which case
the well costs are charged to expense.

     The Company's Ozona Deep exploration well was drilled during 2002 and found
quantities of oil believed to be commercial;  however, given its location in the
Gulf of Mexico, it is necessary to have a signed production  handling  agreement
("PHA") with infrastructure in the area to insure the economics  associated with
the  discovery  prior to  doing  further  appraisal  drilling.  Pioneer  and the
operator of Ozona Deep have been diligently engaging potential counterparties to
enter  into a PHA to  bring  future  production  from  the  discovery  to  their
platform.  The Company anticipates entering into a PHA and drilling an appraisal
well during 2005.

     During  2003,  the  Company's   Alaskan  Oooguruk   discovery  wells  found
quantities of oil believed to be commercial.  In 2003, the Company began farm-in
discussions with the owner of undeveloped  discoveries in adjacent acreage given
its proximity and the potential  costs benefits of a larger scale  project.  The
farm-in was completed during 2004. Along with completing the farm-in  agreement,
Pioneer  obtained  access to  exploration  well and seismic  data to help better
understand the potential of the discoveries  without having to drill  additional
wells. In late 2004, the Company  completed an extensive  technical and economic
evaluation of the resource potential within this area and authorized a front-end
engineering and design study ("FEED study") for the area which is expected to be
completed in 2005. If the FEED study confirms favorable  development  economics,
the  Company  will seek to obtain  regulatory  approval  to develop the field in
2006, targeting first oil sales in 2008. Simultaneously,  the Company is working
to  secure  throughput  agreements  to  process  the  associated  potential  oil
production at a nearby facility should the project be sanctioned.

     During 2001,  the Company  drilled two South African  discovery  wells that
found  quantities of condensate and gas believed to be commercial.  During 2004,
2003  and  2002,  the  Company  actively  reviewed  the gas  supply  and  demand
fundamentals in South Africa and had discussions with a gas-to-liquids  plant in
the area to purchase  the  condensate  and gas.  During  2004,  a FEED study was
authorized for the gas development and infrastructure design. The FEED study was
completed  in early  2005 and  based  on that  study,  the  plant  operator  has
initiated  purchase  orders  for  long-lead  time   infrastructure   components.
Currently,  negotiations are underway to secure a production  contract and it is
the Company's expectation that the project will be sanctioned in 2005.

     During 2003, the Company drilled two exploration wells on its Anaguid Block
in  Tunisia  which  found  quantities  of  condensate  and  gas  believed  to be
commercial.  During  2004,  the wells were  scheduled  and approved for extended
production tests.  However, the project operator delayed the extended production
tests due to issues  unrelated  to the  Company  or the  project.  In 2005,  the
project operator, along with the Company, has approved extended production tests
of the existing wells and the drilling of two additional appraisal wells.

NOTE E.    Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values
of the Company's financial instruments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:


     Cash and cash  equivalents,  accounts  receivable,  other  current  assets,
accounts payable,  interest payable and other current liabilities.  The carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

     Commodity price swap and collar contracts,  interest rate swaps and foreign
currency  swap  contracts.  The fair  value of  commodity  price swap and collar
contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are estimated from
quotes  provided  by  the  counterparties  to  these  derivative  contracts  and
represent the estimated  amounts that the Company would expect to receive or pay
to settle the  derivative  contracts.  See Note K for a  description  of each of
these derivatives, including whether the derivative contract qualifies for hedge
accounting treatment or is considered a speculative derivative contract.

     Financial   assets.   The  carrying  amounts  of  the  trading   securities
approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair
value of the 5-1/2  percent note  receivable  due 2008 was  determined  based on
underlying  market  rates of  interest.  The current  portion of the 5-1/2% note
receivable due 2008,  amounting to $.4 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
is  included  in other  current  assets in the  Company's  Consolidated  Balance
Sheets.  The trading  securities and the noncurrent  portions of the 5-1/2% note
receivable  due 2008 are included in other assets in the Company's  Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

     Long-term  debt. The carrying  amount of borrowings  outstanding  under the
Company's  corporate  credit  facility  approximates  fair value  because  these
instruments  bear interest at variable market rates.  The fair values of each of
the senior note issuances were determined based on quoted market prices for each
of the issues.  See Note F for  additional  information  regarding the Company's
long-term debt.

NOTE F.        Long-term Debt

     Long-term  debt,  including  the effects of net deferred  fair value hedges
gains (losses) and issuance  discounts and premiums,  consisted of the following
components at December 31, 2004 and 2003:


     Principal  maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2004 are as follows
(in thousands):


     During the year ending  December  31, 2005,  $131 million of the  Company's
8-7/8%  senior  notes due 2005 (the  "8-7/8  Notes")  will  mature and the first
anniversary of the Company's  364-Day Credit  Agreement will occur.  The Company
intends to initially utilize unused borrowing  capacity under its 364-Day Credit
Agreement to repay the 8-7/8% Notes and to transfer outstanding  borrowings,  if
any, under the 364-Day  Credit  Agreement to the Company's  five-year  unsecured
revolving  credit  agreement  (the  "Revolving  Credit  Agreement") on its first
anniversary.  As a result of the  Evergreen  merger,  the $100 million of 4 3/4%
senior  convertible notes due 2021 (the  "Convertible  Notes") are redeemable at
any time at the option of the holders.  If the holders of the Convertible  Notes
do not redeem the  Convertible  Notes prior to December  20,  2006,  the Company
intends to exercise its rights under the  indenture  and redeem the  Convertible
Notes on such date for  cash,  common  stock or a  combination  thereof.  If the
holders exercise their rights to redeem the Convertible  Notes prior to December
20, 2006, the Company intends to refinance the cash redemption costs with unused
borrowing  capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement.  The Convertible Notes
are reflected in "Thereafter" in the above maturities  table.  Accordingly,  the
Company has classified  these debt  obligations as long-term in its Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002


     Lines of credit.  In December 2003, the Company  entered into the Revolving
Credit  Agreement,  as amended,  that matures in December 2008. The terms of the
Revolving  Credit  Agreement  provide for initial  aggregate loan commitments of
$700  million  from  a  syndication  of  participating  banks  (the  "Lenders").
Aggregate loan commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be increased
to a maximum  aggregate  amount of $1 billion if the Lenders increase their loan
commitments or if loan  commitments of new financial  institutions  are added to
the Revolving  Credit  Agreement.  During June 2004, the Company  entered into a
first amendment (the "First Amendment") to its Revolving Credit Agreement.  As a
result  of  the  First  Amendment,   Pioneer  Natural  Resources  USA,  Inc.,  a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Pioneer USA"), is no longer a guarantor
of the  Revolving  Credit  Agreement.  Borrowings  under  the  Revolving  Credit
Agreement may be in the form of revolving  loans or swing line loans.  Aggregate
outstanding  swing line loans may not exceed $80 million.  Revolving  loans bear
interest,  at the option of the Company,  based on (a) a rate per annum equal to
the higher of the prime rate  announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank
(5.25  percent per annum at December 31,  2004) or the  weighted  average of the
rates on  overnight  Federal  funds  transactions  with  members of the  Federal
Reserve System during the last preceding  business day plus 50 basis point (2.47
percent  per  annum  at  December  31,  2004)  or  (b) a base  Eurodollar  rate,
substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") (2.34 percent
per annum at December  31,  2004),  plus a margin that is based on a grid of the
Company's  debt rating (100 basis points per annum at December 31, 2004).  Swing
line loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the "ASK" rate for Federal
funds periodically  published by the Dow Jones Market Service.  The Company pays
commitment  fees on the undrawn  amounts  under the Revolving  Credit  Agreement
based on a grid of the Company's  debt rating (.25 percent per annum at December
31, 2004).  As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $28 million  borrowed under
the Revolving Credit Agreement.

     In September 2004, the Company  entered into the 364-Day Credit  Agreement,
as amended,  that provided for initial loan  commitments  of $900  million.  The
364-Day  Credit  Agreement  was  utilized  to  finance  the  Evergreen   merger.
Borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement may, at the option of the Company,
be designated to bear interest based on (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher
of the prime  rate  announced  from time to time by  JPMorgan  Chase Bank or the
weighted  average of the rates on  overnight  Federal  funds  transactions  with
members of the Federal  Reserve  System during the last  preceding  business day
plus 50 basis  points  or (b) a base  Eurodollar  rate,  substantially  equal to
LIBOR,  plus a margin that is based on a grid of the  Company's  debt rating (75
basis points per annum at December 31, 2004).  The Company pays  commitment fees
on the undrawn  amounts under the 364-Day Credit  Agreement based on grid of the
Company's  debt rating  (.25  percent per annum at  December  31,  2004).  As of
December 31, 2004, the Company had $800 million  revolving loans  outstanding on
the 364-Day Credit Agreement.

     The Revolving Credit  Agreement and 364-Day Credit Agreement  (collectively
the "Lines of Credit") share similar  restrictive  covenants.  Those restrictive
covenants  include the  maintenance of a ratio of the Company's  earnings before
gain or loss on the  disposition  of assets,  interest  expense,  income  taxes,
depreciation,  depletion and amortization expense,  exploration and abandonments
expense and other noncash charges and expenses to consolidated  interest expense
of at  least  3.5  to  1.0;  maintenance  of a  ratio  of  total  debt  to  book
capitalization  less  intangible  assets  (other  than  intangible  oil  and gas
assets),  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income and  certain  noncash  asset
write-downs  not to exceed .60 to 1.0;  and if the Company  should fall below an
investment grade rating, maintenance of an annual ratio of the net present value
of the Company's oil and gas  properties to total debt of at least 1.25 to 1.00.
The Company was in compliance  with all of its debt covenants as of December 31,
2004.

     As of December 31, 2004,  the Company had $57.1 million of undrawn  letters
of credit,  of which $49.3 million were undrawn  commitments  under the Lines of
Credit.  The letters of credit  outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement
are subject to a per annum fee,  based on a grid of the  Company's  debt rating,
representing  the Company's LIBOR margin (100 basis points at December 31, 2004)
plus .125  percent.  As of December 31, 2004,  the Company had unused  borrowing
capacity of $722.7 million under the Lines of Credit.  During February 2005, the
Company  requested a $250 million  reduction in the loan  commitments  under the
364-Day Credit Agreement to $650 million.







                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002



     In January 2005, the Company  amended the Lines of Credit  primarily to (i)
provide for the Company's  ability to enter into volumetric  production  payment
agreements and (ii) to clarify certain definitional matters.

     Senior notes. The Company's senior notes are general unsecured  obligations
ranking equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness
of the  Company  and are senior in right of payment to all  existing  and future
subordinated  indebtedness of the Company. The Company is a holding company that
conducts all of its operations through  subsidiaries;  consequently,  the senior
notes are  structurally  subordinated  to all  obligations of its  subsidiaries.
Interest on the Company's senior notes is payable  semiannually.  The indentures
of the Company's  senior notes provide for subsidiary  guarantees  equivalent to
any such guarantees provided under the Revolving Credit Agreement.  Accordingly,
the First  Amendment also had the effect of removing  Pioneer USA as a guarantor
of the Company's senior notes.

     On July 15, 2004, the Company  accepted tenders to exchange $117.9 million,
$275.1 million and $133.8 million in principal amount of its 8 1/4% senior notes
due 2007  (the "8 1/4%  Notes"),  9-5/8%  senior  notes  due 2010  (the "9- 5/8%
Notes") and 7.50% senior notes due 2012 (the "7.50% Notes" and collectively with
the 8 1/4% Notes and the 9- 5/8% Notes,  the "Old Notes"),  respectively,  for a
like principal  amount of a new series of 5.875% senior notes due 2016 (the "New
Notes")  and cash.  The  aggregate  exchange  price  paid to the  holders of the
tendered notes exceeded their  aggregate  principal  balances by $109.0 million,
which amount was paid in cash to holders of the New Notes.  In  accordance  with
EITF  Abstract  Issue No.  96-19,  "Debtors  Accounting  for a  Modification  or
Exchange of Debt Instruments",  this amount is being amortized as an increase to
the  Company's  interest  expense over the term of the New Notes.  In connection
with the tenders of the 9-5/8% Notes and the 7.50% Notes,  the Company  received
consents  which   permanently   removed   substantially  all  of  the  operating
restrictions  with respect to those notes once certain  investment grade ratings
were  achieved.  Associated  with the  tenders to  exchange  the Old Notes,  the
Company incurred direct  transaction costs of $2.2 million during the year ended
December  31,  2004,  which were  recorded  as  charges to other  expense in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

     Interest on the New Notes is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15
of each year,  commencing  January 15,  2005.  The New Notes are  governed by an
indenture  between the Company and The Bank of New York dated  January 13, 1998.
The New Notes are general  unsecured  obligations of the Company ranking equally
in right of payment with all other senior unsecured  indebtedness of the Company
and are  senior in right of  payment to all  existing  and  future  subordinated
indebtedness of the Company.

     In connection with the Evergreen  merger,  the Company assumed the position
of Evergreen as the issuer of the  Convertible  Notes and $200 million of 5.875%
Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2012 (the "EVG 5.875% Notes").  In addition to a
4.75  percent  fixed  annual  rate of  interest,  the Company is required to pay
contingent  interest  to the  holders  of the  Convertible  Notes.  The  rate of
contingent  interest  payable  in  respect to any  six-month  period  equals the
greater of (i) a per annum rate equal to five percent of the Company's estimated
per  annum  borrowing  rate for  senior  nonconvertible  fixed-rate  debt with a
maturity date comparable to the Convertible Notes or (ii) .30 percent per annum.
In no event may the contingent  interest rate exceed .40 percent per annum.  The
Company is accruing  contingent interest on the Convertible Notes at the rate of
..30 per annum.

     The  Convertible  Notes are due on December 15, 2021 but are  redeemable at
either the Company's  option or the holder's option on other specified dates. As
a result of the Evergreen  merger,  the Convertible Notes are convertible at any
time by the holders as discussed in the  following  paragraph.  Holders may also
require  the  Company  to  repurchase  all or part of the  Convertible  Notes on
December 20, 2006,  December 15, 2011 or December 15, 2016 at a repurchase price
of 100 percent of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus accrued and
unpaid  interest  (including  contingent  interest).  On December 20, 2006,  the
Company may redeem the Convertible Notes in whole or in part in cash,  in shares







                        PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002


of common stock, or in any combination of cash and common stock. On December 15,
2011 or December 15, 2016,  the Company must pay the  repurchase  price in cash.
The Company,  currently,  intends to exercise its rights under the indenture and
redeem the Convertible Notes on December 20, 2006, if the Convertible Notes have
not been redeemed by the holders.

     Each $25.00 principal  balance  outstanding  under the Convertible Notes is
convertible  into .58175  shares of the  Company's  common stock plus $19.98 per
share, which includes Evergreen Kansas properties proceeds (as an example,  each
$1,000 of  Convertible  Notes  principal  would exchange for 23.27 shares of the
Company's common stock plus $799 of cash). The portion of the Convertible  Notes
exchangeable  into the Company's  common stock is included in the computation of
the Company's average diluted shares outstanding.

     The EVG 5.875% Notes assumed in the  Evergreen  merger are due on March 15,
2012 with interest  payable on March 15 and  September 15 of each year.  The EVG
5.875% Notes were unsecured senior subordinated indebtedness,  were subordinated
in  right  of  payment  to all of  the  Company's  existing  and  future  senior
indebtedness,  and ranked  equally in right of payment with all of the Company's
future senior unsecured subordinated indebtedness.  Prior to March 15, 2007, the
Company may redeem up to 35 percent of the original  principal amount of the EVG
5.875%  Notes with the net cash  proceeds of one or more equity  offerings  at a
redemption  price of 105.875  percent of the principal  amount of the EVG 5.875%
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On or after March 15, 2008, the Company
may redeem all or a portion of the EVG 5.875% Notes at redemption prices ranging
from 102.938 percent to 100 percent of the principal  amount, as provided by the
indenture for the EVG 5.875% Notes. The EVG 5.875% Notes also contain provisions
for  redemption at the holders'  option upon the  occurrence  of certain  future
events,  including  a change in  control.  During  October  2004,  the  Company,
pursuant to the  indenture  for the EVG 5.875%  Notes,  commenced  an offer,  in
connection  with the  change of  control of  Evergreen  (the  "Change of Control
Offer"), to repurchase any or all of the EVG 5.875% Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to 101 percent of the principal amount of the EVG 5.875% Notes,  plus
accrued and unpaid interest. The Change of Control Offer expired on November 10,
2004.  In  addition  to the Change of Control  Offer,  during  October  2004 the
Company  solicited  consents  to  proposed  amendments  to the EVG 5.875%  Notes
indenture to:

       o      eliminate the  subordination  of the  right of  payment on the EVG
              5.875% Notes to the  payment  in full  of all  existing and future
              senior indebtedness of Pioneer;

       o      amend restrictive  covenants applicable to the EVG 5.875% Notes so
              that they  are  the same  as  the  restrictive  covenants  in  the
              Company's senior notes  that were originally  issued as high-yield
              notes; and

       o      amend the  provisions  of the  EVG 5.875%  Notes  that suspend the
              restrictive  covenants  when the  EVG 5.875%  Notes  have  certain
              investment grade ratings so that those provisions  are the same as
              the suspension and  permanent-elimination  provisions in Pioneer's
              senior notes that were originally issued as high-yield notes.

Holders of a majority in  outstanding  principal  amount of the EVG 5.875% Notes
approved  the proposed  amendments  on October 29,  2004.  As a result,  the EVG
5.875% Notes are no longer subordinated.

     As of December 31, 2004,  the  aggregate  carrying  value of the  Company's
senior notes was net of $3.5 million of  unamortized  net deferred  hedge losses
realized from terminated  fair value hedge interest rate swap  contracts.  As of
December 31, 2003, the aggregate  carrying  value of the Company's  senior notes
included $27.4 million of incremental carrying value attributable to unamortized
net  deferred  hedge  gains.  See Note K for  additional  information  regarding
terminated fair value hedge interest rate swap contracts.

     Early  extinguishment  of debt and capital cost obligation.  In conjunction
with the Change of Control Offer,  the Company  repurchased  $5.5 million of the

NOTE H.     Incentive Plans

Retirement Plans

     Deferred  compensation  retirement  plan. In August 1997, the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors approved a deferred compensation  retirement
plan for the officers and certain key employees of the Company. Each officer and
key employee is allowed to  contribute up to 25 percent of their base salary and
100  percent  of their  annual  bonus.  The  Company  will  provide  a  matching
contribution  of 100 percent of the  officer's and key  employee's  contribution
limited to the first 10 percent of the  officer's  base salary and eight percent
of the key employee's base salary.  The Company's  matching  contribution  vests
immediately.  A trust fund has been established by the Company to accumulate the
contributions   made  under  this  retirement   plan.  The  Company's   matching
contributions were $.9 million,  $.9 million and $.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     401(k) plan. The Pioneer  Natural  Resources USA, Inc.  401(k) and Matching
Plan (the "401(k) Plan") is a defined  contribution  plan established  under the
Internal  Revenue  Code Section 401. The 401(k) Plan was formed by the merger of
the Pioneer  Natural  Resources  USA, Inc.  401(k) Plan and the Pioneer  Natural
Resources USA, Inc.  Matching Plan on January 1, 2002. All regular full-time and
part-time  employees  of Pioneer USA are eligible to  participate  in the 401(k)
Plan on the first day of the month  following  their date of hire.  Participants
may  contribute  an amount of not less than two percent nor more than 30 percent
of their annual salary into the 401(k) Plan. Matching  contributions are made to
the 401(k)  Plan in cash by Pioneer  USA in  amounts  equal to 200  percent of a
participant's  contributions  to the 401(k)  Plan that are not in excess of five
percent of the participant's  basic compensation (the "Matching  Contribution").
Each  participant's  account is credited with the  participant's  contributions,
their Matching  Contributions  and  allocations  of the 401(k) Plan's  earnings.
Participants  are fully  vested in their  account  balances  except for Matching
Contributions and their proportionate share of 401(k) Plan earnings attributable
to Matching  Contributions,  which  proportionately vest over a four-year period
that begins with the participant's date of hire. During the years ended December
31, 2004,  2003 and 2002, the Company  recognized  compensation  expense of $5.4
million,  $4.5 million and $4.1 million,  respectively,  as a result of Matching
Contributions.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

     In August 1997, the Company's  stockholders  approved a Long-Term Incentive
Plan which  provides for the  granting of incentive  awards in the form of stock
options,  stock appreciation  rights,  performance units and restricted stock to
directors,  officers and employees of the Company.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan
provides for the issuance of a maximum number of shares of common stock equal to
10 percent of the total number of shares of common stock equivalents outstanding
less the total number of shares of common stock  subject to  outstanding  awards
under any stock-  based plan for the  directors,  officers or  employees  of the
Company.

     The following  table  calculates the number of shares or options  available
for grant under the Company's  Long- Term Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2004
and 2003:


     Stock option  awards.  Prior to 2004, the Company had a program of awarding
semiannual  stock  options  to  its  employees.   The  Company  also  gives  its
non-employee  directors a choice to receive (i) 100  percent  restricted  stock,
(ii) 100 percent stock options, (iii) 100 percent cash, or (iv) a combination of
50/50 of any two, as their annual compensation.  This program provides for stock
option  awards at an exercise  price  based upon the closing  sales price of the
Company's  common  stock on the day  prior to the date of  grant.  Stock  option
awards  vest over an  18-month or  three-year  schedule  and provide a five-year
exercise period from each vesting date.  Non-employee  directors'  stock options
vest  quarterly  and provide for a five-year  exercise  period from each vesting
date. The Company  granted  1,353,988 and 1,643,212  options under the Long-Term
Incentive Plan during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     In accordance with the Merger Agreement, on September 28, 2004, the Company
assumed  fully-vested  options to  purchase  2,384,657  shares of the  Company's
common stock at various exercise prices, the weighted average price per share of
which was $11.18.  The assumed  options  were  outstanding  awards to  Evergreen
employees when the Evergreen merger occurred.

     During 2004, the Company's stock-based  compensation philosophy shifted its
emphasis from the awarding of stock options to  restricted  stock awards.  There
were no options granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan during the year ended
December 31, 2004.

     Restricted  stock  awards.  During the year ended  December 31,  2004,  the
Company  assumed  214,186  restricted  stock  units in  exchange  for  Evergreen
restricted  stock units  outstanding  on September  28, 2004 and issued  630,937
restricted  shares of the Company's  common stock as  compensation to directors,
officers and employees of the Company.

     The  Company  recorded  $6.0  million of deferred  compensation  for future
expected  service  associated with certain of the restricted stock units assumed
from  Evergreen.  The  deferred  compensation  is being  amortized as charges to
compensation  expense  over the periods in which the  restrictions  on the units
lapse.

     During the years  ended  December  31, 2003 and 2002,  the  Company  issued
77,625  and  654,445   restricted   shares  of  the   Company's   common  stock,
respectively.  The  restricted  share  awards  were  issued as  compensation  to
directors, officers and key employees of the Company.

     The Company  recorded  $19.1  million,  $1.1  million and $16.2  million of
deferred   compensation   associated  with   restricted   stock  awards  in  the
stockholders'  equity section during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.  Such amounts will be amortized to compensation expense over
the vesting  periods of the awards.  During the years ended  December  31, 2004,
2003 and 2002,  amortization of restricted  stock awards increased the Company's
compensation   expense  by  $12.5  million,   $5.4  million  and  $1.9  million,
respectively.

     The following table reflects the outstanding  restricted stock awards as of
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and activity related thereto for the years then
ended:


     A summary of the Company's stock option plans as of December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, and changes during the years then ended, are presented below:

     The  following  table  summarizes  information  about the  Company's  stock
options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2004:


     SFAS  123   disclosures.   The   Company   applies   APB  25  and   related
interpretations  in  accounting  for its stock option  awards.  Accordingly,  no
compensation  expense  has been  recognized  for its  stock  option  awards.  If
compensation expense for the stock option awards had been determined  consistent
with SFAS 123, the  Company's  net income and earnings per share would have been
less than the reported  amounts.  See Note B for a comparison  of net income and
net income per share as reported  and as adjusted  for the pro forma  effects of
determining compensation expense in accordance with SFAS 123.

     Under SFAS 123,  the fair value of each stock  option grant is estimated on
the date of grant using the Black- Scholes option pricing model. The Company did
not grant any stock options during the year ended December 31, 2004.

     The following weighted average  assumptions were used to estimate the value
of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002:


Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     As discussed  above in Note B, the Company has an ESPP that allows eligible
employees to annually purchase the Company's common stock at a discounted price.
Officers  of  the  Company  are  not  eligible  to   participate  in  the  ESPP.
Contributions  to the  ESPP are  limited  to 15  percent  of an  employee's  pay
(subject  to certain  ESPP  limits)  during  the nine-  month  offering  period.
Participants in the ESPP purchase the Company's  common stock at a price that is
15 percent below the closing sales price of the Company's common stock on either
the first day or the last day of each offering period,  whichever  closing sales
price is lower.

Postretirement Benefit Obligations

     As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,  the Company had recorded  $15.5  million
and $15.6 million,  respectively, of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations,  the current and noncurrent portions of which are included in other
current liabilities and other liabilities and minority interests,  respectively,
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These obligations are comprised
of five  plans of  which four  relate to  predecessor entities  that the Company

acquired in prior  years.  These plans had no assets as of December  31, 2004 or
2003. Other than the Company's  retirement plan, the participants of these plans
are not current employees of the Company.

     The  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligations  pertaining to these
plans were determined by independent actuaries for four plans representing $11.4
million  of  unfunded  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligations  as  of
December 31, 2004 and by the Company for one plan  representing  $4.1 million of
unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2004.
Interest  costs at an annual  rate of six percent of the  periodic  undiscounted
accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligations were employed in the valuations
of the benefit  obligations.  Certain of the  aforementioned  plans  provide for
medical and dental cost  subsidies for plan  participants.  Annual  medical cost
escalation  trends of 11 percent in 2005,  declining to five percent in 2011 and
thereafter,  and annual dental cost escalation  trends of seven percent in 2005,
declining to five percent in 2009 and thereafter,  were employed to estimate the
accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligations associated with the medical and
dental cost subsidies.

     The  following  table   reconciles   changes  in  the  Company's   unfunded
accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligations during the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:


     Estimated  benefit payments and service costs associated with the plans for
the  year  ended   December  31,  2005  are  $1.5  million  and  $1.4   million,
respectively.

NOTE I.     Issuance of Common Stock

     During April 2002, the Company  completed a public offering of 11.5 million
shares of its  common  stock at $21.50  per  share.  Associated  therewith,  the
Company  received  $236.0  million of net proceeds after the payment of issuance
costs.  The Company used the net proceeds  from the public  offering to fund the
2002  acquisition of Falcon assets and associated  acreage in the deepwater Gulf
of  Mexico  and the  West  Panhandle  gas  field  acquisitions.  See  Note C for
information regarding these acquisitions.

NOTE J.     Commitments and Contingencies

     Severance  agreements.  The Company has entered into  severance  agreements
with its  officers,  subsidiary  company  officers  and certain  key  employees.
Salaries and bonuses for the Company's  officers are set by the Company's  board
of directors for the parent  company  officers and by the  Company's  management
committee for subsidiary company officers and key employees. The Company's board
of directors and management  committee can grant increases or reductions to base
salary at their  discretion.  The current annual salaries for the parent company
officers,  the subsidiary  company officers and key employees covered under such
agreements total $23.6 million.

     Indemnifications.  The Company has indemnified its directors and certain of
its officers,  employees  and agents with respect to claims and damages  arising
from  acts or  omissions  taken in such  capacity,  as well as with  respect  to
certain litigation.

     Legal actions.  The Company is party to various legal actions incidental to
its business,  including,  but not limited to, the proceedings  described below.
The majority of these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising from
oil and gas leases and ownership  interest  disputes.  The Company believes that
the ultimate disposition of these legal actions will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's  consolidated  financial  position,  liquidity,  capital
resources or future results of operations. The Company will continue to evaluate
its  litigation  matters  on a  quarter-by-  quarter  basis and will  adjust its
litigation  reserves  as  appropriate  to  reflect  the then  current  status of
litigation.

     Alford.  The Company is party to a 1993 class action  lawsuit  filed in the
26th Judicial District Court of Stevens County, Kansas by two classes of royalty
owners,  one for  each  of the  Company's  gathering  systems  connected  to the
Company's Satanta gas plant. The case was relatively inactive for several years.
In early 2000, the plaintiffs  amended their pleadings and the case now contains
two material  claims.  First,  the plaintiffs  assert that they were  improperly
charged  expenses   (primarily  field   compression),   which  are  a  "cost  of
production",   and  for  which  the  plaintiffs,  as  royalty  owners,  are  not
responsible.  Second,  the plaintiffs  claim they are entitled to 100 percent of
the value of the helium  extracted at the  Company's  Satanta gas plant.  If the
plaintiffs  were to  prevail on the above two  claims in their  entirety,  it is
possible that the Company's  liability  (both for periods covered by the lawsuit
and from the last date  covered  by the  lawsuit  to the  present - because  the
deductions  continue  to be taken and the  plaintiffs  continue to be paid for a
royalty share of the helium) could reach  approximately  $30 million  related to
the cost of production claim and approximately $40 million related to the helium
claim,  plus prejudgment  interest.  However,  the Company believes it has valid
defenses to the plaintiffs' claims, has paid the plaintiffs properly under their
respective  oil and gas leases and other  agreements,  and intends to vigorously
defend itself.

     The  Company  does not  believe  the costs it has  deducted  are a "cost of
production".  The costs being  deducted are post  production  costs  incurred to
transport the gas to the Company's  Satanta gas plant for processing,  where the
valuable  hydrocarbon  liquids  and  helium  are  extracted  from the  gas.  The
plaintiffs  benefit from such extractions and the Company believes that charging
the  plaintiffs  with  their  proportionate  share  of such  transportation  and
processing  expenses  is  consistent  with  Kansas  law and  with  the  parties'
agreements.

     The Company has also vigorously  defended against plaintiffs' claims to 100
percent of the value of the helium  extracted,  and believes  that in accordance
with  applicable  law, it has  properly  accounted to the  plaintiffs  for their
fractional  royalty share of the helium under the specified  royalty  clauses of
the respective oil and gas leases.  The Company has not  established a provision
for the helium claim.

     The  factual  evidence  in the case  was  presented  to the  26th  Judicial
District Court without a jury in December 2001. Oral arguments were heard by the
court in April 2002,  and  although  the court has not yet entered a judgment or
findings,  it could do so at any time. The Company strongly denies the existence
of any material  underpayment to the plaintiffs and believes it presented strong
evidence at trial to support its positions. However, either through a negotiated
settlement or court ruling,  the Company could have to pay some part of the cost
of  production  claim and,  accordingly,  the Company has  established a partial
reserve for this claim.  Although the amount of any resulting liability,  to the
extent that it exceeds the Company's  provision,  could have a material  adverse
effect on the Company's results of operations for the quarterly reporting period
in which such  liability is recorded,  the Company does not expect that any such
additional  liability will have a material  adverse  effect on its  consolidated
financial  position as a whole or on its liquidity,  capital resources or future
annual results of operations.

     Kansas ad valorem tax. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ("NGPA") allows a
"severance,  production  or similar"  tax to be included as an add-on,  over and
above the maximum  lawful price for gas.  Based on a Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") ruling that Kansas ad valorem tax was such a tax, one of the
Company's  predecessor  entities collected the Kansas ad valorem tax in addition
to the otherwise  maximum  lawful  price.  The FERC's ruling was appealed to the
United  States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  ("D.C.  Circuit"),
which held in June 1988 that the FERC failed to provide a  reasonable  basis for
its findings and remanded the case to the FERC for further consideration.

     On December 1, 1993,  the FERC issued an order  reversing its prior ruling,
but limited the effect of its decision to Kansas ad valorem taxes for sales made
on or after June 28, 1988. The FERC clarified the effective date of its decision
by an order dated May 18, 1994.  The order  clarified  that the  effective  date
applies to tax bills  rendered  after June 28, 1988,  not sales made on or after
that date.  Numerous  parties  filed  appeals  on the FERC's  action in the D.C.
Circuit.  Various gas producers challenged the FERC's orders on two grounds: (1)
that  the  Kansas  ad  valorem  tax,  properly  understood,   does  qualify  for
reimbursement  under the NGPA; and (2) the FERC's ruling  should,  in any event,
have been applied  prospectively.  Other parties challenged the FERC's orders on
the grounds that the FERC's  ruling  should have been applied  retroactively  to
December 1, 1978,  the date of the  enactment of the NGPA and  producers  should
have been required to pay refunds accordingly.

     The D.C.  Circuit  issued its decision on August 2, 1996,  which holds that
producers  must make refunds of all Kansas ad valorem tax collected with respect
to production since October 4, 1983, as opposed to June 28, 1988.  Petitions for
rehearing  were denied on November 6, 1996.  Various gas producers  subsequently
filed a petition  for writ of  certiori  with the United  States  Supreme  Court
seeking to limit the scope of the potential  refunds to tax bills rendered on or
after  June 28,  1988 (the  effective  date  originally  selected  by the FERC).
Williams  Natural Gas Company  filed a  cross-petition  for certiori  seeking to
impose refund  liability back to December 1, 1978. Both petitions were denied on
May 12, 1997.

     The Company and other  producers  filed  petitions for adjustment  with the
FERC on June 24, 1997. The Company was seeking a waiver or set-off from the FERC
with respect to that  portion of the refund  associated  with (i)  nonrecoupable
royalties,  (ii)  nonrecoupable  Kansas  property taxes based, in part, upon the
higher  prices  collected and (iii)  interest for all periods.  On September 10,
1997,  FERC denied this request,  and on October 10, 1997, the Company and other
producers filed a request for rehearing. Pipelines were given until November 10,
1997 to file claims on refunds sought from producers and refund claims  totaling
approximately  $30.2  million were made against the Company.  As of December 31,
2004,  the Company has settled all of the original claim amounts and believes it
has no further obligation related to this case.

     Lease  agreements.  The  Company  leases  offshore  production  facilities,
equipment and office facilities under  noncancellable  operating leases.  Rental
expenses associated with these operating leases for the years ended December 31,
2004,  2003 and 2002 were  approximately  $51.8 million,  $15.5 million and $6.7
million,  respectively.  Future minimum lease commitments  under  noncancellable
operating leases at December 31, 2004 are as follows (in thousands):

     Drilling  commitments.  The Company  periodically  enters into  contractual
arrangements under which the Company is committed to expend funds to drill wells
in the future.  The Company also enters into  agreements to secure  drilling rig
services  which require the Company to make future  minimum  payments to the rig
operators. The Company records drilling commitments in the periods in which well
capital is expended or rig services are provided.

     Transportation  agreements.  Associated  with  the  Evergreen  merger,  the
Company assumed gas transportation  commitments for specified volumes of gas per
year through 2014. The  transportation  commitments  are for  approximately  132
million  cubic feet  ("MMcf") of gross gas sales  volumes  per day during  2005,
declining  to  approximately  40 MMcf of gross gas sales  volumes per day during
2014.

     One  of  the  Company's  Canadian  subsidiaries  is  a  party  to  pipeline
transportation  service  agreements,  with remaining terms of  approximately  11
years, whereby it has committed to transport a specified volume of gas each year
from  Canada  to a point  in  Chicago.  Such  gas  volumes  are  comprised  of a
significant portion of the Company's Canadian net gas production, augmented with
certain volumes  purchased at market prices in Canada.  The committed volumes to
be  transported  under  the  pipeline   transportation  service  agreements  are
approximately 78 MMcf of gas per day during 2005 and decline to approximately 75
MMcf of gas per day by the end of the  commitment  term.  The net gas  marketing
gains or losses  resulting from purchasing third party gas in Canada and selling
it in Chicago are recorded as other income or other expense in the  accompanying
Consolidated  Statements of Operations.  Associated with these  agreements,  the
Company  recognized $1.2 million,  $.9 million and $2.6 million of gas marketing
losses in other expense during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

commitments at December 31, 2004 are as follows (in thousands):


NOTE K.     Derivative Financial Instruments

     Fair value  hedges.  The  Company  monitors  the debt  capital  markets and
interest  rate  trends to  identify  opportunities  to enter into and  terminate
interest  rate swap  contracts  with the  objective  of  minimizing  its cost of
capital.  During the  three-year  period ending  December 31, 2004, the Company,
from time to time,  entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion
of the fair  value of its  senior  notes.  The terms of the  interest  rate swap
contracts were for notional  amounts that matched the scheduled  maturity of the
hedged  senior  notes,  required the  counterparties  to pay the Company a fixed
annual  interest  rate equal to the stated  bond  coupon  rates on the  notional
amounts and  required  the  Company to pay the  counterparties  variable  annual
interest  rates on the notional  amounts equal to the periodic  six-month  LIBOR
plus a weighted average annual margin.  During the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company paid $9.4  million,  net of $2.2 million of  associated  settlements
receivable,  to terminate  fair value hedge  interest  rate swaps prior to their
stated maturities. Associated therewith, the Company recognized $11.6 million of
"Payments of other  liabilities" in the accompanying  Consolidated  Statement of
Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002,  the Company  terminated  fair value hedge interest rate swap
contracts for cash proceeds,  including accrued  interest,  of $21.5 million and
$36.3 million,  respectively. The proceeds attributable to the fair value of the
remaining terms of the terminated  contracts amounted to $18.3 million and $32.0
million  and are  included  in  "Proceeds  from  disposition  of  assets" in the
accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of Cash  Flows  during  the  years ended

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002


December 31, 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  During the years ended  December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, settlements of open fair value hedges reduced the Company's
interest expense by $2.2 million, $29.3 million and $25.3 million, respectively.
As of  December  31,  2004,  the  Company was not a party to any open fair value
hedges.

     As of December 31, 2004, the carrying value of the Company's long-term debt
in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  included  a  $3.5  million
reduction in the carrying  value  attributable  to net deferred  hedge losses on
terminated  fair value  hedges  that are being  amortized  as net  increases  to
interest  expense  over the original  terms of the  terminated  agreements.  The
amortization  of net  deferred  hedge gains on  terminated  interest  rate swaps
reduced the Company's reported interest expense by $19.2 million,  $26.1 million
and $14.1  million  during the years ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,
respectively.

     The terms of the fair value  hedge  agreements  described  above  perfectly
matched the terms of the hedged senior notes.  Accordingly,  the Company did not
realize any hedge  ineffectiveness  associated with its fair value hedges during
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.

     The  following  table sets forth,  as of December 31, 2004,  the  scheduled
amortization  of net deferred hedge gains  (losses) on terminated  interest rate
hedges,  including  $3.4  million of  deferred  losses on  terminated  cash flow
interest  rate  hedges,  that will be  recognized  as  increases  in the case of
losses,  or decreases in the case of gains,  to the  Company's  future  interest
expense:


     Cash flow hedges.  The Company utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts
to (i) reduce the effect of price  volatility  on the  commodities  the  Company
produces and sells,  (ii) support the  Company's  annual  capital  budgeting and
expenditure  plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain
capital  projects.  The Company has also, from time to time,  utilized  interest
rate contracts to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company's
indebtedness  and forward currency  exchange  agreements to reduce the effect of
U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate volatility.

                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002


     Oil prices.  All material physical sales contracts  governing the Company's
oil production  have been tied directly or indirectly to the New York Mercantile
Exchange  ("NYMEX") prices. The following table sets forth the volumes hedged in
barrels ("Bbl") underlying the Company's outstanding oil hedge contracts and the
weighted  average  NYMEX  prices per Bbl for those  contracts as of December 31,
2004:

                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002



     The Company reports average oil prices per Bbl including the effects of oil
quality  adjustments and the net effect of oil hedges.  The following table sets
forth the Company's  oil prices,  both reported  (including  hedge  results) and
realized  (excluding  hedge  results),  and the net effect of settlements of oil
price  hedges on oil revenue for the years ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and
2002:


     Natural gas liquids prices.  During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, the Company did not enter into any NGL hedge contracts.  There were no
outstanding NGL hedge contracts at December 31, 2004.

     Gas prices.  The  Company  employs a policy of hedging a portion of its gas
production based on the index price upon which the gas is actually sold in order
to mitigate the basis risk between  NYMEX  prices and actual  index  prices,  or
based on NYMEX  prices if NYMEX  prices  are  highly  correlated  with the index
price.  The  following  table sets forth the volumes  hedged in million  British
thermal units ("MMBtu") underlying the Company's outstanding gas hedge contracts
and the  weighted  average  index  prices  per MMBtu for those  contracts  as of
December 31, 2004:

                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002



     The Company  reports  average gas prices per  thousand  cubic feet  ("Mcf")
including the effects of British thermal unit ("Btu")  content,  gas processing,
shrinkage adjustments and the net effect of gas hedges. The following table sets
forth the Company's  gas prices,  both reported  (including  hedge  results) and
realized  (excluding  hedge  results),  and the net effect of settlements of gas
price  hedges on gas revenue for the years ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and
2002:


     Interest rate.  During June 2004, the Company  entered into costless collar
contracts and  designated  the  contracts as cash flow hedges of the  forecasted
interest rate risk  attributable to the yield on the benchmark 4.75 percent U.S.
Treasury Notes due May 15, 2014 (the "U.S. Treasuries"). The terms of the collar
contracts  fixed  the  annual  yield on $250  million  notional  amount  of U.S.
Treasuries  within a yield  collar  having a ceiling  rate of 4.70 percent and a
floor rate of 4.65 percent.  The yield on the U.S. Treasuries as of July 7, 2004
was the  benchmark  rate used to determine  the coupon rate on the Company's New
Notes,  which were issued on July 15, 2004 in exchange  for  portions of the Old
Notes.  During July 2004, the Company terminated these costless collar contracts
for  $3.4   million  of  cash   payments.   The  Company  did  not  realize  any
ineffectiveness in connection with the costless collar contracts during the year
ended December 31, 2004. See Note F for information  regarding the July 15, 2004
debt exchange.

     Hedge  ineffectiveness.  During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002,  the Company  recognized  other expense of $4.3 million,  $2.8 million and
$1.7 million, respectively, related to the ineffective portions of its cash flow
hedging instruments. These charges include amounts related to hedge volumes that
exceeded revised  forecasts of production  volumes due to delays in the start-up
of production in certain fields.

     Accumulated other comprehensive  income (loss) - net deferred hedge losses,
net of tax ("AOCI - Hedging").  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, AOCI - Hedging
represented net deferred losses of $241.4 and $104.1 million,  respectively. The
AOCI - Hedging  balance as of December 31, 2004 was comprised of $363.1  million
of net deferred losses on the effective portions of open cash flow hedges,  $3.0
million of net deferred  losses on terminated  cash flow hedges  (including $3.4
million of net deferred losses on terminated cash flow interest rate hedges) and
$124.7  million of  associated  net  deferred tax  benefits.  The AOCI - Hedging
balance as of December 31, 2003 was comprised of $200.6  million of net deferred
losses on the effective portions of open cash flow hedges,  $45.1 million of net
deferred  gains on  terminated  cash flow hedges and $51.4 million of associated
net deferred tax benefits.  The increase in AOCI - Hedging during the year ended
December 31, 2004 was primarily  attributable  to increases in future  commodity
prices  relative to the  commodity  prices  stipulated  in the hedge  contracts,
partially  offset by the  reclassification  of net deferred  hedge losses to net
income as derivatives matured by their terms. The net deferred losses associated
with open cash flow hedges remain subject to market price fluctuations until the
positions  are  either  settled  under  the  terms  of the  hedge  contracts  or
terminated  prior to  settlement.  The net deferred gains (losses) on terminated
cash flow hedges are fixed.

     During the  twelve-month  period ending December 31, 2005, based on current
estimates of future commodity  prices,  the Company expects to reclassify $224.1
million of net deferred losses  associated  with open commodity  hedges and $1.7
million of net deferred gains on terminated commodity hedges from AOCI - Hedging
to oil and gas revenues.  The Company also expects to  reclassify  approximately
$81.2  million of net deferred  income tax benefits  associated  with  commodity
hedges  during the  twelve-month  period  ending  December  31, 2005 from AOCI -
Hedging to income tax benefit.

     The  following  table sets forth,  as of December 31, 2004,  the  scheduled
amortization of net deferred gains (losses) on terminated  commodity hedges that
will be recognized  as increases in the case of gains,  or decreases in the case
of losses, to the Company's future oil and gas revenues:


NOTE L.     Major Customers and Derivative Counterparties

     Sales to major customers.  The Company's share of oil and gas production is
sold to various  purchasers who must be prequalified  under the Company's credit
risk  policies  and  procedures.  The Company  records  allowances  for doubtful
accounts  based on the agings of accounts  receivable  and the general  economic
condition of its  customers.  The Company is of the opinion that the loss of any
one purchaser  would not have an adverse effect on the ability of the Company to
sell its oil and gas production.

     The following customer individually accounted for 10 percent or more of the
consolidated  oil, NGL and gas revenues of the Company during one or more of the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:


     At December 31, 2004, the Company had no amounts  receivable  from Williams
Power Company, Inc.

     Derivative  counterparties.  The Company  uses  credit and other  financial
criteria to evaluate the credit  standing of, and to select,  counterparties  to
its derivative  instruments.  Although the Company does not obtain collateral or
otherwise secure the fair value of its derivative instruments, associated credit
risk is mitigated by the Company's  credit risk policies and  procedures.  As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003,  the Company had $5.3 million of  derivative  assets
for which Enron North  America Corp was the Company's  counterparty.  Associated
therewith,  the Company had a $4.5 million allowance for doubtful accounts as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

NOTE M.     Asset Retirement Obligations

     As referred to in Note B, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on
January 1, 2003. The Company's asset retirement  obligations primarily relate to
the future plugging and abandonment of proved properties and related facilities.
The Company  does not provide for a market risk  premium  associated  with asset
retirement  obligations  because a reliable  estimate cannot be determined.  The
Company has no assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset

NOTE O.     Asset Divestitures

     During the years  ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  the  Company
completed asset divestitures for net proceeds of $1.7 million, $35.7 million and
$118.9 million,  respectively.  Associated therewith, the Company recorded gains
on disposition  of assets of $39 thousand,  $1.3 million and $4.4 million during
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     Hedge derivative divestitures. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002,  the  Company  terminated,   prior  to  their  scheduled  maturity,  hedge
derivatives  for  cash  sales  proceeds  of $18.3  million  and  $91.3  million,
respectively.  Net gains from these divestitures were deferred and are amortized
over the original contract lives of the terminated  derivatives as reductions to
interest  expense  or  increases  to oil and gas  revenues.  See Note K for more
information regarding deferred gains and losses on terminated hedge derivatives.

     Other United States divestitures.  During the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company  received  $1.2 million of cash proceeds from the sale of other U.S.
corporate assets.  Associated with these divestitures,  the Company recorded $.2
million of net gains.  During the year ended  December  31,  2003,  the  Company
received  $15.2  million of cash  proceeds  from the sale of  unproved  property
interests and $.9 million of cash proceeds from the sale of other U.S. corporate
assets. Associated with these divestitures, the Company recorded $1.5 million of
net gains.  During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company  received $20.9
million of proceeds from the cash settlement of a gas balancing receivable, $4.7
million  from the sale of certain gas  properties  located in Oklahoma  and $1.8
million  from  the  sale  of  other  corporate  assets.  Associated  with  these
divestitures, the Company recorded net gains of $4.2 million.

NOTE Q.     Income Taxes

     The Company  accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income
Taxes"  ("SFAS  109").  The  Company  and  its  eligible   subsidiaries  file  a
consolidated United States federal income tax return.  Certain  subsidiaries are
not eligible to be included in the consolidated United States federal income tax
return and separate  provisions for income taxes have been  determined for these
entities or groups of entities. The tax returns and the amount of taxable income
or loss are subject to examination by United States  federal,  state,  local and
foreign taxing authorities. Current and estimated tax payments of $17.1 million,
$5.3  million and $2.3  million  were made during the years ended  December  31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     SFAS 109 requires  that the Company  continually  assess both  positive and
negative  evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred
tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration.  From 1998 until 2003, the
Company  maintained  valuation  allowances against a portion of its deferred tax
asset position in the United States.  During 2003, the Company concluded,  based
on its  improved  operating  results,  that it was more  likely than not that it
would be able to realize  its gross  deferred  tax asset  position in the United
States. Accordingly, the Company reversed its valuation allowances in the United
States.

     Pioneer will continue to monitor Company-specific, oil and gas industry and
worldwide  economic  factors and will reassess the likelihood that the Company's
net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in the United
States and foreign tax jurisdictions will be utilized prior to their expiration.
As of December 31, 2004, the Company's  valuation  allowances related to foreign
tax jurisdictions were $108.2 million.

     On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the "AJCA") was signed
into law.  The AJCA  includes a  deduction  of 85  percent  of  certain  foreign
earnings that are repatriated,  as defined in the AJCA. The Company may elect to
apply this provision to qualifying  earnings  repatriations in 2005. The Company
has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision; however,
the Company does not expect to be able to complete this  evaluation  until after
Congress or the Treasury  Department provide additional  clarifying  language on
key elements of the provision. The Company expects to complete its evaluation of
the effects of the  repatriation  provision  within a reasonable  period of time
following the publication of the additional  clarifying  language.  The range of
possible amounts that the Company is considering for repatriation  under section
965 of the Internal  Revenue Code is between zero and $80 million with a related
potential  range of income tax between  zero and $5  million.  Until the Company
decides to repatriate  any foreign  earnings,  it will continue to treat them as
permanently invested.

     During the year ended  December  31,  2004,  the  Company  recorded a $26.9
million  tax  benefit  associated  with  the  deduction  of the  Company's  only
investment in Gabon resulting from the impairment of the Olowi field. See Note T
for additional discussion regarding the impairment of the Gabonese Olowi field.

Company has alternative minimum tax NOLs ("AMT NOLs") in the United States which
are available to reduce future alternative minimum taxable income, if any. These
carryforwards expire as follows:


     The Company believes $120 million of the U.S. NOLs and AMT NOLs are subject
to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and are limited in each taxable year
to approximately $20 million. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, the Company  utilized $124.2  million,  $17.1 million and $34.6 million of
NOLs, respectively.

NOTE R.     Income Per Share Before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting
            Principle

     Basic income per share  before  cumulative  effect of change in  accounting
principle is computed by dividing income before  cumulative  effect of change in
accounting principle by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period.  The  computation of diluted income per share before  cumulative
effect of change in accounting  principle  reflects the potential  dilution that
could occur if  securities  or other  contracts  to issue  common stock that are
dilutive to income before  cumulative  effect of change in accounting  principle
were  exercised  or  converted  into common stock or resulted in the issuance of
common stock that would then share in the earnings of the Company.

     The following table is a  reconciliation  of the basic and diluted earnings
before cumulative  effect of change in accounting  principle for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

NOTE S.     Geographic Operating Segment Information

     The Company has operations in only one industry segment, that being the oil
and  gas  exploration  and  production   industry;   however,   the  Company  is
organizationally structured along geographic operating segments, or regions. The
Company has reportable  operations in the United States,  Argentina,  Canada and
Africa and Other.  Africa and Other is  primarily  comprised  of  operations  in
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, South Africa and Tunisia.

     The following tables provide the geographic operating segment data required
by  Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 131,  "Disclosure  about
Segments  of an  Enterprise  and  Related  Information",  as well as  results of
operations  of oil  and  gas  producing  activities  required  by  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting Standards No. 69, "Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing
Activities"  as of and for the years ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002.
Geographic  operating  segment  income  tax  benefits   (provisions)  have  been
determined  based on statutory  rates existing in the various tax  jurisdictions
where the Company has oil and gas producing activities. The "Headquarters" table
column includes revenues,  expenses,  additions to property, plant and equipment
and  assets  that  are  not  routinely  included  in the  earnings  measures  or
attributes  internally reported to management on a geographic  operating segment
basis.

NOTE T.     Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties

     During  October  2004,  the Company  concluded  that a material  charge for
impairment  was  required  under  SFAS  144  for its  Gabonese  Olowi  field  as
development  of the  discovery  was canceled.  Due to  significant  increases in
projected field  development  costs,  primarily due to recent increases in steel
costs, the project does not offer competitive  returns.  The Olowi field was the
Company's  only Gabonese  investment.  The  Company's  current  Gabonese  permit
expires in April 2005.  The Company has  verbally  requested an extension to the
permit to allow more time for the Company to  determine  the best manner to exit
Gabon,  however,  no assurance can be given that such extension will be granted.
During 2004, the Company recorded an associated  impairment  charge to eliminate
the carrying value of the Company's Gabonese Olowi field of $39.7 million.

NOTE U.     Subsequent Event - Volumetric Production Payments

     During  January  2005,  the Company  sold two  percent of its total  proved
reserves,  or 20.5  million BOE of proved  reserves,  by means of VPPs for total
proceeds of $593 million and the assumption of the Company's  obligations  under
certain derivative hedge agreements.  Proceeds from the VPPs were initially used
to pay down indebtedness.

     The VPPs represent limited term overriding royalty interests in oil and gas
reserves which: (i) entitle the purchaser to receive  production  volumes over a
period of time from  specific  lease  interests;  (ii) are free and clear of all
associated  future  production  costs  and  capital   expenditures;   (iii)  are
nonrecourse to the Company (i.e., the purchaser's only recourse is to the assets
acquired);  (iv) transfers  title to the purchaser and (v) allows the Company to
retain the assets after the VPP's volumetric obligations have been satisfied.

     The first VPP sells 58 billion cubic feet of Hugoton field gas volumes over
an  expected  five-year  term  beginning  in February  2005 for $275  million of
proceeds.  The second VPP sells 10.8 million barrels of oil equivalent ("MMBOE")
of Spraberry  field oil volumes over an expected  seven-year  term  beginning in
January 2006 for $318 million of proceeds.

     Under  SFAS 19,  a VPP is  considered  a sale of  proved  reserves  and the
related future production of those proved reserves. As a result the Company will
(i) remove the proved reserves  associated with the VPPs; (ii) recognize the VPP
proceeds as deferred  revenue  which will be amortized  on a  unit-of-production
basis to future oil and gas  revenues  over the terms of the VPPs;  (iii) retain
responsibility for 100 percent of the production costs and capital costs related
to VPP interests and (iv) no longer recognize production associated with the VPP
volumes.

     The Company  will  amortize to oil and gas  revenues  $62.9  million of net
deferred gas revenue during 2005  associated  with the Hugoton field VPP. During
2006,  the Company  will  amortize  $53.7  million of net  deferred  gas revenue
associated  with the Hugoton  field VPP and $57.6  million of net  deferred  oil
revenue associated with the Spraberry field VPP.

                  Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002


Results of Operations

     Information  about the  Company's  results  of  operations  for oil and gas
producing  activities by geographic  operating segment is presented in Note S of
the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reserve Quantity Information

     The estimates of the  Company's  proved oil and gas reserves as of December
31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  which are located in the United  States,  Argentina,
Canada,  Gabon, South Africa and Tunisia,  were based on evaluations  audited by
independent  petroleum  engineers with respect to the Company's major properties
and prepared by the Company's  engineers  with respect to all other  properties.
Reserves were estimated in accordance with guidelines  established by the United
States  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  and the FASB,  which  require that
reserve estimates be prepared under existing  economic and operating  conditions
with  no  provision  for  price  and  cost  escalations  except  by  contractual
arrangements.  The Company  reports all reserves held under  production  sharing
arrangements and concessions  utilizing the "economic  interest"  method,  which
excludes the host country's share of proved reserves.  Estimated  quantities for
production sharing  arrangements  reported under the "economic  interest" method
are  subject  to  fluctuations  in the  prices  of oil and  gas and  recoverable
operating expenses and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities
attributable to recovery of costs will change  inversely to changes in commodity
prices.  The reserve  estimates as of December  31, 2004,  2003 and 2002 utilize
respective  oil  prices  of  $41.96,  $31.10  and  $29.67  per  Bbl  (reflecting
adjustments for oil quality), respective NGL prices of $29.12, $20.26 and $19.01
per Bbl, and respective gas prices of $4.76, $4.23 and $3.37 per Mcf (reflecting
adjustments for Btu content, gas processing and shrinkage).

     Oil  and  gas   reserve   quantity   estimates   are  subject  to  numerous
uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in
the  projection  of future  rates of  production  and the timing of  development
expenditures.  The  accuracy of such  estimates  is a function of the quality of
available data and of engineering  and geological  interpretation  and judgment.
Results of subsequent  drilling,  testing and production may cause either upward
or downward revision of previous estimates.  Further,  the volumes considered to
be  commercially  recoverable  fluctuate  with  changes in prices and  operating
costs. The Company  emphasizes that reserve  estimates are inherently  imprecise
and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of currently
producing oil and gas properties.  Accordingly,  these estimates are expected to
change as additional information becomes available in the future.

     Proved  reserves at  December  31,  2004  include 6.1 MMBOE  related to the
ten-year  extension  periods  contained in the  Company's  Argentine  concession
agreements. Upon approval by the government, the extension periods begin in 2016
and 2017  depending on the  effective  date that each  concession  agreement was
granted.  The  Company  believes,  based  on  historical  precedent,  that  such
extensions will be obtained as a matter of course.

     The  following  table  provides a rollforward  of total proved  reserves by
geographic  area and in total for the years ended  December 31,  2004,  2003 and
2002, as well as proved developed reserves by geographic area and in total as of
the beginning and end of each respective year. Oil and NGL volumes are expressed
in  thousands  of Bbls  ("MBbls"),  gas volumes are  expressed in MMcf and total
volumes are expressed in thousands of barrels oil equivalent ("MBOE").

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

     The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by
applying  year-end  prices of oil and gas (with  consideration  of price changes
only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to the estimated future
production of proved oil and gas reserves  less  estimated  future  expenditures
(based on year-end  costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved
reserves,  discounted  using a rate  of 10  percent  per  year  to  reflect  the
estimated timing of the future cash flows. Future income taxes are calculated by
comparing  undiscounted  future  cash  flows  to the  tax  basis  of oil and gas
properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying the current tax
rates to the  difference.  The  discounted  future  cash flow  estimates  do not
include the effects of the  Company's  commodity  hedging  contracts.  Utilizing
December 31, 2004  commodity  prices held  constant  over each hedge  contract's
term, the net present value of the Company's  hedge  contracts,  less associated
estimated  income  taxes  and  discounted  at 10  percent,  was a  liability  of
approximately $291 million at December 31, 2004.

     Discounted  future  cash flow  estimates  like  those  shown  below are not
intended to  represent  estimates  of the fair value of oil and gas  properties.
Estimates  of fair value should also  consider  probable  reserves,  anticipated
future oil and gas prices, interest rates, changes in development and production
costs and risks  associated with future  production.  Because of these and other
considerations,  any  estimate  of fair  value  is  necessarily  subjective  and
imprecise.

            FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

       None.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     Evaluation of disclosure  controls and procedures.  The Company's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated, as required by
Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange  Act"),
the Company's  disclosure  controls and  procedures  (as defined in Exchange Act
Rule  13a-15(e))  as of the end of the period  covered by this annual  report on
Form  10-K.  Based on that  evaluation,  the  principal  executive  officer  and
principal  financial  officer  concluded  that the design and  operation  of the
Company's  disclosure  controls and  procedures  are  effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or  submits  under the  Exchange  Act is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

     Changes in internal  control over financial  reporting.  There have been no
changes in the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting (as defined
in Rule  13a-15(f)  under the Exchange Act) that  occurred  during the Company's
last fiscal quarter that have  materially  affected or are reasonably  likely to
materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.


        MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

     The  management of Pioneer  Natural  Resources  Company (the  "Company") is
responsible for  establishing  and maintaining  adequate  internal  control over
financial reporting.  The Company's internal control over financial reporting is
a process  designed  under the  supervision  of the  Company's  Chief  Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding
the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of the Company's
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

     As of December  31, 2004,  management  assessed  the  effectiveness  of the
Company's  internal  control over financial  reporting based on the criteria for
effective  internal  control over financial  reporting  established in "Internal
Control  --  Integrated  Framework",  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway  Commission.  Based on the assessment,  management
determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on those criteria.

     Ernst & Young LLP, the independent  registered  public accounting firm that
audited the  consolidated  financial  statements of the Company included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K,  has issued an  attestation  report on  management's
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of December  31,  2004.  The report,  which  expresses  unqualified
opinions on management's  assessment and on the  effectiveness  of the Company's
internal  control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004, is included
in this  Item  under  the  heading  "Report  of  Independent  Registered  Public
Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting".









                     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
          ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Pioneer Natural Resources Company:

     We have  audited  management's  assessment,  included  in the  accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial  Reporting,  that Pioneer
Natural Resources Company and subsidiaries (the "Company")  maintained effective
internal  control over  financial  reporting  as of December 31, 2004,  based on
criteria  established in Internal  Control - Integrated  Framework issued by the
Committee of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway  Commission  (the "COSO
criteria").  The Company's  management is responsible for maintaining  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial  reporting.  Our responsibility
is to  express  an  opinion  on  management's  assessment  and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting based
on our audit.

     We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and  perform  the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether
effective  internal  control over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all
material  respects.  Our audit included  obtaining an  understanding of internal
control over financial reporting,  evaluating management's  assessment,  testing
and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control,  and
performing   such  other   procedures   as  we   considered   necessary  in  the
circumstances.  We believe that our audit  provides a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

     A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the company;  (2)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

     Because  of its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial
reporting  may not prevent or detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of any
evaluation  of  effectiveness  to future  periods  are  subject to the risk that
controls may become  inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     In  our  opinion,  management's  assessment  that  the  Company  maintained
effective internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004, is
fairly stated, in all material  respects,  based on the COSO criteria.  Also, in
our  opinion,  the  Company  maintained,  in all  material  respects,  effective
internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the
COSO criteria.

     We also have  audited,  in  accordance  with the  standards  of the  Public
Company  Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the consolidated  balance
sheets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated  statements
of operations,  stockholders' equity, cash flows and comprehensive income (loss)
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 of the Company
and our report dated February 17, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
