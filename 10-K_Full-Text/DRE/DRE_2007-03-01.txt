Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this
Report, including, without limitation, those related to our future operations,
constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of
the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The words “believe,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek”, “may” and similar expressions
or statements regarding future periods are intended to identify forward-looking
statements.

These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results,
performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from any
predictions of future results, performance or achievements that we express or
imply in this Report or in the information incorporated by reference into this
Report. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may
affect future results include, among others:

·

Changes
in general economic and business conditions, including performance of financial
markets;

·

Our
continued qualification as a REIT;

·

Heightened
competition for tenants and potential decreases in property occupancy;

·

Potential
increases in real estate construction costs;

·

Potential
changes in the financial markets and interest rates;

·

Our
continuing ability to favorably raise funds through the issuance of debt and
equity in the capital markets;

·

Our
ability to successfully identify, acquire, develop and/or manage properties on
terms that are favorable to us;

·

Our
ability to successfully dispose of properties on terms that are favorable to
us;

·

Inherent
risks in the real estate business including tenant defaults, potential
liability relating to environmental matters and liquidity of real estate
investments; and

·

Other
risks and uncertainties described or incorporated by reference herein,
including, without limitation, those risks and uncertainties discussed from
time to time in our other reports and other public filings with the SEC.

This list of risks and uncertainties, however, is only a summary of
some of the most important factors and is not intended to be exhaustive.
Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included
under the caption “Risk Factors” in this Report, and is updated by us from time
to time in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and
other filings that we make with the SEC.

Although we presently believe that the plans, expectations and results
expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements are reasonable, all
forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and subject to change, as
they involve substantial risks and uncertainties beyond our control. New
factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict the
nature, or assess the potential impact, of each new factor on our business.
Given these uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our
forward-looking statements for events or circumstances that arise after the
statement is made, except as required by law.


PART I

Item 1.  Business

Background

We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment
trust (“REIT”), which began operations upon completion of our initial public
offering in February 1986. In October 1993, we completed an additional common
shares offering and acquired the rental real estate and service businesses of
Duke Associates, whose operations began in 1972. As of December 31, 2006, our
diversified portfolio of 721 rental properties (including 28 properties
totaling approximately 4.5 million square feet under development) encompass
approximately 113.8 million rentable square feet and are leased by a diverse
and stable base of more than 3,500 tenants whose businesses include
manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, distribution and professional
services. We also own or control more than 6,400 acres of unencumbered land
ready for development.

Through our Service Operations, we provide, on a fee basis, leasing,
property and asset management, development, construction, build-to-suit and
other tenant-related services. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” for financial information. Our rental
operations are conducted through Duke Realty Limited Partnership (“DRLP”). In
addition, we conduct our Service Operations through Duke Realty Services LLC,
Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited
Partnership.  In this Form 10-K Report,
the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Duke Realty Corporation and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) and those entities owned or controlled by the
Company.

Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis,
Indiana. In addition, we have 16 regional offices located in Alexandria,
Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Cleveland, Ohio;
Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Nashville, Tennessee; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Raleigh, North
Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri; Tampa, Florida; and Weston, Florida. We had
approximately 1,250 employees as of December 31, 2006.

Business Strategy

Our business objective is to increase Funds From Operations (“FFO”) by
(i) maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the
management of our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) developing and
acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets; (iii)
expanding geographically by acquiring and developing properties in new markets;
(iv) using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor in our
existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis; (v) developing
properties in our existing markets and other markets which we will sell through
our merchant building development program and (vi) providing a full line of
real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.

FFO is used by
industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure
of an equity REIT like Duke. FFO is calculated in accordance with the
definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure
of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among
other items, from net income determined in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure developed
by NAREIT to compare the operating performance of REITs.  The most comparable GAAP measure is net
income (loss).  FFO should not be
considered as a substitute for net income or any other measures derived in
accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies.

Historical cost
accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since
real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market
conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation
of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost
accounting to be insufficient by themselves. 
FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding
extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of
previously depreciated operating real estate


assets, plus
certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization,
and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
ventures.

Management
believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP
presentations, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs
among the investing public and has made comparisons of REIT operating results
more meaningful.  Management considers FFO
to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial
performance (although FFO should be reviewed in conjunction with net income
which remains the primary measure of performance) because, by excluding gains
or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate
assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO
assists in comparing the operating performance of our real estate between
periods or as compared to different companies.

As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house
leasing, management, development and construction services which, coupled with
our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing
business parks, should give us a competitive advantage both as a real estate
operator and in future development activities.

We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks
can be done most effectively at regional or local levels. As a result, we
intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market share and effective
rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We also expect to utilize
approximately 6,400 acres of unencumbered land and our many business
relationships with our  3,500 commercial
tenants to expand our build-to-suit business (development projects
substantially pre-leased to a single tenant) and to pursue other development
and acquisition opportunities in our primary markets. We believe that this
regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate
more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our
tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on strong customer
relationships to provide third-party construction and build-for-sale services
outside our primary markets and to expand into high growth and seaport markets
across the United States.

Our strategy is to seek to develop and acquire primarily Class A
commercial properties located in markets with high growth potential for large
national and international companies and other quality regional and local
firms. Our industrial and suburban office development focuses on business parks
and mixed-use developments suitable for multiple projects on a single site
where we can create and control the business environment. These business parks
and mixed-use developments often include restaurants and other amenities, which
we believe will create an atmosphere that is particularly efficient and
desirable. Our retail development focuses on lifestyle, community and
neighborhood centers in our existing markets and is developed primarily for
held-for-sale opportunities. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are
able to arrange for or provide to our industrial, office, medical and retail
customers not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also
additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish
construction, and expansion flexibility.

All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive
properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators
generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of
competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply and demand of
similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive
on our properties.

Financing Strategy

We seek to maintain a well-balanced, conservative and flexible capital
structure by: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of debt; (ii)
borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of
total debt less than 20%; (iii) pursuing current and future long-term debt
financings and refinancing on an unsecured basis;  (iv) maintaining conservative debt service and
fixed charge coverage ratios; and (v) issuing attractively priced perpetual
preferred shares for 5-10% of our total capital structure.


Management believes that these strategies have enabled and should
continue to enable us to favorably access capital markets for our long-term
requirements such as debt refinancing and financing development and
acquisitions of additional rental properties. In addition, as discussed under
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations,” we have a $1.0 billion unsecured line of credit
available for short-term fundings of development and acquisition of additional
rental properties. Further, we pursue favorable opportunities to dispose of
assets that no longer meet our long-term investment criteria and recycle the
proceeds into new investments that we believe have excellent long-term growth
prospects. Our debt to total market capitalization ratio (total market
capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding common
and preferred shares and units of limited partnership interest (“Units”) in
DRLP plus outstanding indebtedness) at December 31, 2006 was 37.4%. Our ratio
of earnings to debt service and ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year
ended December 31, 2006 were 1.5x and 1.59x, respectively. In computing the
ratio of earnings to debt service, earnings have been calculated by adding
interest expense (excluding amortization of debt issuance costs) to income from
continuing operations, less preferred dividends, and minority interest in earnings
of DRLP. Debt service consists of interest expense and recurring principal
amortization (excluding maturities) and excludes amortization of debt issuance
costs. In computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings have been
calculated by adding interest expense to income from continuing operations and
minority interest in earnings of DRLP. Fixed charges consist of interest costs,
whether expensed or capitalized, the interest component of rental expense and
amortization of debt issuance costs.

Available Information and Exchange Certifications

In addition to
this Annual Report, we file quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and
other

information

with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All documents that are filed
with the SEC are available free of charge on our corporate website, which is
www.dukerealty.com. You may also read and copy any document filed at the public
reference facilities of the SEC at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.
25049. Please call the SEC at (800) SEC-0330 for further information about the
public reference facilities. These documents also may be accessed through the
SEC’s electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval system (“EDGAR”) via
electronic means, including the SEC’s home page on the Internet
(http://www.sec.gov). In addition, since some of our securities are listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, you may read SEC filings at the offices of the New
York Stock Exchange, 20 Broad Street, New York, New York 10005.

The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) requires that the
Chief Executive Officer of each listed company certify annually to the NYSE
that he or she is not aware of any violation by the company of NYSE corporate
governance listing standards as of the date of such certification. We submitted
the certification of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dennis D. Oklak,
with our 2006 Annual Written Affirmation to the NYSE on May 8, 2006.

We included the certifications of the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company required by Section 302
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules, relating to the quality of
the Company’s public disclosure, in this report as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

Our operations
involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay distribution on our common
stock and the market price of our common stock. In addition to the other
information contained in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the
following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our securities.

If
we were to cease to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we and our
shareholders would lose significant tax benefits.

We intend to
continue to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust (a “REIT”)
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Qualification
as a REIT provides significant tax advantages to us and our shareholders.
However, in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy
numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex Code
provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations. Satisfaction of these requirements also depends on various
factual circumstances not entirely within our control. The fact that we hold
our assets


through an
operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application
of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could
jeopardize our REIT status. Although we believe that we can continue to operate
so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot offer any assurance that we can continue
to do so or that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations
or court decisions will not significantly change the qualification requirements
or the federal income tax consequences of qualification. If we were to fail to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would have the following effects:

·

We
would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders and would be
subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum
tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

·

Unless
we were entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT;

·

Our
net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders would
decrease due to the additional tax liability for the year or years involved;
and

·

We
would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders in order
to qualify as a REIT.

As such, failure
to qualify as a REIT would likely have a significant adverse effect on the
value of our securities.

Real
estate investment trust distribution requirements limit the amount of cash we
will have available for other business purposes, including amounts that we need
to fund our future growth.

To maintain our
qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must annually distribute to our
shareholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, excluding net capital
gains. We intend to continue to make distributions to our shareholders to
comply with the 90% distribution requirement. However, this requirement limits
our ability to accumulate capital for use for other business purposes. If we do
not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution
requirements, we may have to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms
in order to meet the distribution requirements. If we fail to make a required
distribution, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax developments could
affect the desirability of investing in us for individual taxpayers.

In May 2003, federal legislation was enacted that reduced
the maximum tax rate for dividends payable to individual taxpayers generally
from 38.6% to 15% (from January 1, 2003 through 2008). However, dividends
payable by REITs are not eligible for this treatment, except in limited
circumstances. Although this legislation did not have a direct adverse effect
on the taxation of REITs or dividends paid by REITs, the more favorable
treatment for non-REIT dividends could cause individual investors to consider
investments in non-REIT corporations as more attractive relative to an
investment in us as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs
and investments in REITs may change, which may result in the loss of our tax
benefits of operating as a REIT.

The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of a REIT and
an investment in a REIT may be modified by legislative, judicial or
administrative action at any time. Revisions in U.S. federal income tax laws
and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect us and the tax
consequences of an investment in our common shares.


Our
net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders could
decrease as a result of factors outside of our control.

Our business is
subject to the risks incident to the ownership and operation of commercial real
estate, many of which involve circumstances not within our control. Such risks
include the following:

·

Changes in the general economic climate;

·

Increases in interest rates;

·

Local conditions such as oversupply of property
or a reduction in demand;

·

Competition for tenants;

·

Changes in market rental rates;

·

Oversupply or reduced demand for space in the
areas where our properties are located;

·

Delay or inability to collect rent from tenants
who are bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise unwilling or unable to pay;

·

Difficulty in leasing or re-leasing space quickly
or on favorable terms;

·

Costs associated with periodically renovating,
repairing and reletting rental space;

·

Our ability to provide adequate maintenance and
insurance on our properties;

·

Our ability to control variable operating costs;

·

Changes in government regulations;

·

Changes in interest rate levels;

·

The availability of financing on favorable terms;
and

·

Potential liability

under, and changes in,
environmental, zoning, tax and other laws.

Further, a
significant portion of our costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and
maintenance costs and our debt service payments, are generally not reduced when
circumstances cause a decrease in cash flow from our properties.

Many
real estate costs are fixed, even if income from properties decreases.

Our financial
results depend on leasing space in our real estate to tenants on terms
favorable to us. Our income and funds available for distribution to our
stockholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay
their rent or we are unable to lease properties on favorable terms. In
addition, if a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our
rights as landlord without delays and we may incur substantial legal costs.
Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and
maintenance costs, generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a
reduction in income from the investment.

Our
real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to
development.

We intend to
continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise. These
development activities generally require various government and other
approvals. We may not receive the necessary approvals. We are subject to the
risks associated with development activities. These risks include:

·

Unsuccessful development opportunities could
result in direct expenses to us;

·

Construction costs of a project may exceed
original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally
estimated, or possibly unprofitable;

·

Time required to complete the construction of a
project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally
anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity;

·

Occupancy rates and rents of a completed project
may not be sufficient to make the project profitable; and

·

Favorable sources to fund our development
activities may not be available.


We are exposed to risks associated with
entering new markets.

We consider
entering new markets from time to time. The construction and/or acquisition of
properties in new markets involves risks, including the risk that the property
will not perform as anticipated and the risk that any actual costs for
rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the
pre-construction or pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates.
There is, and it is expected that there will continue to be, significant
competition for investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria as
well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities,
if necessary.

We
may be unsuccessful in operating completed real estate projects.

We face the risk
that the real estate projects we develop or acquire will not perform in
accordance with our expectations. This risk exists because of factors such as
the following:

·

Prices paid for acquired facilities are based
upon a series of market judgments; and

·

Costs of any improvements required to bring an
acquired facility up to standards to establish the market position intended for
that facility might exceed budgeted costs.

Further, we can
give no assurance that acquisition targets meeting our guidelines for quality
and yield will be available when we seek them.

We
are exposed to the risks of defaults by tenants.

Any of our tenants
may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken their financial
condition. In the event of default or the insolvency of a significant number of
our tenants, we may experience a substantial loss of rental revenue and/or
delays in collecting rent and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights
as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection, a court could allow
the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our income and
distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of
our tenants became unable to meet their obligations to us, became insolvent or
declared bankruptcy.

We
may be unable to renew leases or relet space.

When our tenants
decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to
relet the space. Even if our tenants do renew or we are able to relet the
space, the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of renovations, if
necessary) may be less favorable than current lease terms. If we are unable to
promptly renew the leases or relet the space, or if the rental rates upon such
renewal or reletting are significantly lower than current rates, then our
income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected, especially if
we were unable to lease a significant amount of the space vacated by tenants in
our properties.

Our
insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We maintain
comprehensive insurance on each of our facilities, including property,
liability, fire, flood and extended coverage. We believe this coverage is of
the type and amount customarily obtained for real property. However, there are
certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as
earthquakes, hurricanes and floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be
uninsurable or not economically insurable. We use our discretion when
determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms
are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable
cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial
loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current
replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes
and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also may make it
unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been
damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds we
receive may not be adequate to restore our economic position in a property. If
an insured loss occurred, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated
profits and cash flow from a property, and we would continue to be obligated on
any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related


to the property.
Although we believe our insurance is with highly rated providers, we are also
subject to the risk that such providers may be unwilling or unable to pay our
claims when made.

Acquired
properties may expose us to unknown liability.

From time to time,
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or
with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities.  As a result, if a liability were asserted
against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay
substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our
results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to
acquired properties might include:

·

liabilities
for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

·

claims
by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the
properties;

·

liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

·

claims
for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others
indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

We
could be exposed to significant environmental liabilities as a result of
conditions of which we currently are not aware.

As an owner and
operator of real property, we may be liable under various federal, state and
local laws for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous
substances released on or in our property. Such laws often impose liability
without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible
for, the release of the hazardous substances. In addition, we could have
greater difficulty in selling real estate on which hazardous substances were
present or in obtaining borrowings using such real estate as collateral. It is
our general policy to have Phase I environmental audits performed for all of
our properties and land by qualified environmental consultants. These Phase I
environmental audits have not revealed any environmental liability that would
have a material adverse effect on our business. However, a Phase I
environmental audit does not involve invasive procedures such as soil sampling
or ground water analysis, and we cannot be sure that the Phase I environmental
audits did not fail to reveal a significant environmental liability or that a
prior owner did not create a material environmental condition on our properties
or land which has not yet been discovered. We could also incur environmental
liability as a result of future uses or conditions of such real estate or
changes in applicable environmental laws.

Certain
of our officers hold units in our operating partnership and may not have the
same interests as our shareholders with regard to certain tax matters.

Certain of our
officers own limited partnership units in our operating partnership, Duke
Realty Limited Partnership. Owners of limited partnership units may suffer
adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties, the
refinancing of debt related to those properties or in the event we are the
subject of a tender offer or merger. As such, owners of limited partnership
units, including certain of our officers, may have different objectives
regarding the appropriateness of the pricing and timing of these transactions.
Though we are the sole general partner of the operating partnership and have
the exclusive authority to sell all of our wholly-owned properties or to
refinance such properties, officers who hold limited partnership units may
influence us not to sell or refinance certain properties even if such sale may
be financially advantageous to our shareholders. Adverse tax consequences may
also influence the decisions of these officers in the event we are the subject
of a tender offer or merger.

We
do not have exclusive control over our joint venture investments.

We have interests
in joint ventures and partnerships and may in the future conduct business
through joint ventures and partnerships. These investments involve risks that
are not present in our wholly-owned projects. For example, co-investors or
partners may become bankrupt or have business interests or goals inconsistent
with ours. Further, our co-investors or partners may be in a position to take
action contrary to our instructions and our interests, including action that
may jeopardize our qualification as a REIT.


Our
use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

We are subject to
the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our
cash flow will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments
and the risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness, or
that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our
existing indebtedness. If our debt cannot be paid, refinanced or extended, we
may not be able to make distributions to shareholders at expected levels or at
all. Further, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a
refinancing result in higher interest rates or other restrictive financial
covenants upon the refinancing, then such refinancing would adversely affect
our cash flow and funds available for operation, development and distribution.
We are also subject to financial covenants under our existing debt instruments.
Should we fail to comply with the covenants in our existing debt instruments,
then we would not only be in breach under the applicable debt instruments but
we would also likely be unable to borrow any further amounts under these
instruments, which could adversely affect our ability to fund operations. We
also have incurred and may incur in the future indebtedness that bears interest
at variable rates. Thus, as market interest rates increase, so will our debt
expense, affecting our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to
shareholders.

We
are subject to various financial covenants under existing credit agreements.

The terms of our
various credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a
number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt
service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These
covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these
covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the
applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our
indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our
distributable cash flow would be adversely affected.

We
are subject to certain provisions that could discourage change-of-control
transactions, which may reduce the likelihood of our shareholders receiving a
control premium for their shares.

Indiana
anti-takeover legislation and certain provisions in our governing documents, as
we discuss below, may discourage potential acquirers from pursuing a
change-of-control transaction with us. As a result, our shareholders may be
less likely to receive a control premium for their shares.

Unissued
Preferred Stock.

Our charter permits our board of
directors to classify unissued preferred stock by setting the rights and
preferences of the shares at the time of issuance. This power enables our board
to adopt a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill. Although we
have repealed our previously existing poison pill and our current board of
directors has adopted a policy not to issue preferred stock as an anti-takeover
measure, our board can change this policy at any time. The adoption of a poison
pill would discourage a potential bidder from acquiring a significant position
in the company without the approval of our board.

Business-Combination
Provisions of Indiana Law.

We have not opted out
of the business-combination provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law.
As a result, potential bidders may have to negotiate with our board of
directors before acquiring 10% of our stock. Without securing board approval of
the proposed business combination before crossing the 10% ownership threshold,
a bidder would not be permitted to complete a business combination for five
years after becoming a 10% shareholder. Even after the five-year period, a
business combination with the significant shareholder would require a “fair
price” as defined in the Indiana Business Corporation Law or the approval of a
majority of the disinterested shareholders.

Control-Share-Acquisition
Provisions of Indiana Law.

We have not opted out of the
provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law regarding acquisitions of
control shares. Therefore, those who acquire a significant block (at least 20%)
of our shares may only vote a portion of their shares unless our other
shareholders vote to accord full voting rights to the acquiring person.
Moreover, if the other shareholders vote to give full voting rights with
respect to the control shares and the acquiring person has acquired a majority
of our outstanding shares, the other shareholders would be entitled to special
dissenters’ rights.


Supermajority
Voting Provisions.

Our charter prohibits business
combinations or significant disposition transactions with a holder of 10% of
our shares unless:

·

The holders of 80% of our outstanding shares of
capital stock approve the transaction;

·

The transaction has been approved by
three-fourths of those directors who served on the board before the shareholder
became a 10% owner; or

·

The significant shareholder

complies with
the “fair price” provisions of our charter.

Among the
transactions with large shareholders requiring the supermajority shareholder
approval are dispositions of assets with a value of $1,000,000 and business
combinations.

Operating
Partnership Provisions.

The limited partnership
agreement of the Operating Partnership contains provisions that could
discourage change-of-control transactions, including a requirement that holders
of at least 90% of the outstanding partnership units held by us and other unit
holders approve:

·

Any voluntary sale, exchange, merger,
consolidation or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Operating Partnership in one or more transactions other than a disposition
occurring upon a financing or refinancing of the Operating Partnership;

·

Our merger, consolidation or other business
combination with another entity unless after the transaction substantially all
of the assets of the surviving entity are contributed to the Operating
Partnership in exchange for units;

·

Our transfer of our interests in the Operating
Partnership other than to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries; and

·

Any

reclassification

or recapitalization
or change of outstanding shares of our common stock other than certain changes
in par value, stock splits, stock dividends or combinations.

We are dependent
on key personnel.

Our executive
officers and other senior officers have a significant role in the success of
our Company. Our ability to retain our management group or to attract suitable
replacements should any members of the management group leave our Company is
dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of
services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their
availability could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow.
Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”) is used by
industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating  performance measure of an equity real estate
investment trust (“REIT”) like Duke. FFO is calculated in accordance with the
definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT created FFO as
a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical
cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure developed
by NAREIT to compare the operating performance of REITs. The most comparable
GAAP measure is net income (loss).  FFO
should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other measures
derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures of other companies.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with
GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes
predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen
or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have
considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that
use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP
net income (loss) excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains
or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets,
plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and
amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and
joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required
primary GAAP presentations, has improved the understanding of operating results
of REITs among the investing public and has made comparisons of REIT operating
results more meaningful. Management considers FFO to be a useful measure for
reviewing comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO should
be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of
performance) because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of
previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate
asset depreciation and amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating
performance of our real estate between periods or as compared to different
companies.

See reconciliation of FFO to GAAP net income under Year in Review
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

Item 7.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations
through a related entity in 1972. As of December 31, 2006, we:

·

Owned or jointly controlled 721 industrial,
office and retail properties (including properties under development),
consisting of approximately 113.8 million square feet; and

·

Owned or jointly controlled more than 6,400 acres
of unencumbered land with an estimated future development potential of more
than 93 million square feet of industrial, office and retail properties.

We provide the following services for our properties and for certain
properties owned by third parties and joint ventures:

·

Property leasing;

·

Property management;

·

Construction;

·

Development;
and

·

Other
tenant-related services.


Management Philosophy and Priorities

Our key business and financial strategies for the future include the
following:

·

Our business objective is to increase Funds From
Operations (“FFO”) by (i) maintaining and increasing property occupancy and
rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties;
(ii) developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our
existing markets; (iii) expanding geographically by acquiring and developing
properties in new markets; (iv) using our construction expertise to act as a general
contractor in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis;
(v) developing and repositioning properties in our existing markets and other
markets which we will sell through our Service Operations property sale
program; and (vi) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants
and to third parties.

See the Year in Review section below for further explanation and
definition of FFO.

·

Our
financing strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital
structure including common and preferred equity and debt to maintain a
conservatively leveraged balance sheet and investment grade ratings from our
credit rating agencies. This strategy provides us with the financial
flexibility to fund both development and acquisition opportunities.

We seek to maintain a well-balanced, conservative
and flexible capital structure by: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity
dates of debt; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable
rate component of total debt less than 20%; (iii) pursuing current and future
long-term debt financings and refinancing generally on an unsecured basis;  (iv) maintaining conservative debt service
and fixed charge coverage ratios; and (v) issuing attractively priced perpetual
preferred stock for 5-10% of our total capital structure.

Year in Review

During 2006, we successfully
executed on our strategy that we began in earnest in 2005 to improve our
portfolio of held for investment buildings through our capital recycling
program, increasing our development pipeline to over $1.2 billion, and
initiating geographic expansion that we anticipate will provide future earnings
growth. As a result of these accomplishments, we achieved steady operating
results while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

Net income available for common shareholders for the year ended
December 31, 2006, was $145.1 million, or $1.07 per share (diluted), compared
to net income of $309.2 million, or $2.17 per share (diluted) for the year
ended 2005. The decrease is primarily attributable to

the $201.5 million
gain from the sale of a portfolio of 212 real estate properties (the “Industrial
Portfolio Sale”) that occurred in 2005 which was partially offset by income
generated by current year building sales, acquired properties and organic
growth.

Through increased leasing activity,
we achieved a growth in rental revenues from continuing operations in 2006 over
2005 as our in-service portfolio occupancy increased from 92.7% at the end of
2005 to 92.9% at the end of 2006.

As an important performance metric for us as a real estate company, FFO
available to common shareholders totaled $338.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006, compared to $341.2 million for the same period in 2005 which
is the result of the time necessary to redeploy the proceeds from the
Industrial Portfolio Sale noted above into FFO generating assets.  Industry analysts and investors use FFO as a
supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust
(“REIT”). FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted
by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income (loss)
determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“GAAP”), excluding extraordinary items as defined
under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating
real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset
depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures.


Historical cost
accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since
real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market
conditions, many industry investors and

analysts

have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies
that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Thus,
NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that
excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from GAAP net income.
Management believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required primary
GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs
among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more
meaningful. Management considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative
operating and financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in
conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance)
because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated
operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and
amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating performance of a company’s
real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.

The following table summarizes the calculation of FFO for the years
ended December 31 (in thousands):

Throughout 2006, we continued to maintain a conservative balance sheet
and investment grade debt ratings from Moody’s (Baa1), Standard & Poors
(BBB+) and Fitch (BBB+). Our debt to total market capitalization ratio (total
market capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding
common and preferred shares and units of limited partner interest in our
operating partnership plus outstanding indebtedness) of 37.4% at December 31,
2006 compared to 31.8% at December 31, 2005 continues to provide us financial
flexibility to fund new investments.

Highlights of our debt financing activity in 2006 are as follows:

·

In
January 2006, we renewed our line of credit, including the extension of the
maturity date to January 2010 and the increase of borrowing capacity by $500.0
million to $1.0 billion with interest rates ranging from LIBOR +.17% to LIBOR
+.525% as of December 31, 2006.

·

We
had $317.0 million outstanding on our line of credit as of December 31, 2006.

·

Through
new issuances, as well as assumptions of debt in conjunction with our 2006
acquisitions, we added $540.6 million of new secured debt in 2006 at a weighted
average interest rate of 6.09% and we retired $40.6 million of secured debt of
which $25.0 million was variable rate.

·

We
issued $854.5 million of unsecured debt at a weighted average interest rate of
4.97% and retired $350.0 million of unsecured debt with a weighted average
interest rate of 6.05%.  We issued $575.0
million of 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Exchangeable Notes”) in November
2006.  The Exchangeable Notes can be
exchanged for shares of our common stock upon certain events as well as at any
time beginning on August 1, 2011 and ending on the second business day prior to
the maturity date.  The Exchangeable
Notes will have an initial exchange rate of approximately 20.4298 common shares
per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, representing an exchange price of
approximately $48.95 per share of our common stock and an exchange premium of
approximately 20.0% based on the last reported sale price of $40.79 per share
of our common stock on the date of issuance. 
The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment under certain
circumstances, including increases in our rate of dividends.  Upon exchange, the holders of the
Exchangeable Notes would receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note
and, at our option, either cash or shares of common stock for the remaining
balance due.


In order to reduce potential dilution of our common
stock, we purchased a capped call option with the proceeds of the Exchangeable
Notes offering that allows us to buy our common shares, up to a maximum of
approximately 11.7 million shares or our common stock, from the option
counterparties at prescribed prices.  The
capped call option will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the
related Exchangeable Notes or the first day all of the related Exchangeable
Notes are no longer outstanding due to exchange or otherwise.  The capped call option, which cost $27.0
million, was recorded as a reduction of shareholders’ equity

and effectively increased the exchange price
to 40% above the stock price on the issuance date.

On the equity side
of our balance

sheet

, we repurchased
approximately 2.2 million common shares for approximately $89.4 million from
the proceeds of our Exchangeable Notes issuance. Additionally, we issued two
new series of preferred equity securities, 6.95% Series M Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Shares and 7.25% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, for
total gross proceeds of $294.0 million while we redeemed our 8.45% Series I
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of $75.0 million.

We continued strategic initiatives to expand geographically and
projects to leverage our development, construction and management capabilities
as follows:

·

We
completed the acquisition of a Washington D.C. metropolitan area portfolio of
32 suburban in service office and light industrial properties, the assets of a
related real estate management company, as well as significant undeveloped land
positions  (all referred to as the “Mark
Winkler Portfolio”) for a purchase price of approximately $867.6 million.  In December 2006, we contributed 23 of the
in-service properties to joint ventures in which we hold a 30% continuing
interest.  We will contribute eight
in-service properties to the joint ventures in the first quarter of 2007.

·

We completed the purchase of a portfolio of
industrial real estate properties in Savannah, Georgia consisting of 18
buildings for a purchase price of approximately $196.2 million.

·

We increased

our

investment in undeveloped land to provide greater opportunities to use
our development and construction expertise in the improving economic cycle.
Throughout 2006, we completed land acquisitions totaling $436.7 million. The
new land positions include industrial, office and retail positions in several
markets, including the Washington D.C., Baltimore, Houston, and Phoenix
markets, which we entered during 2006.

·

We
disposed of 19 non-strategic wholly owned held for rental properties, most
notably our entire Cleveland industrial portfolio, for $139.9 million of gross
proceeds.  Additionally, unconsolidated
subsidiaries disposed of 22 non-strategic held for rental properties of which
our share of the gross proceeds totaled $91.9 million.  These transactions were a continuation of our
long-term strategy of recycling assets into higher yielding new developments.

·

Finally, we will continue to develop long-term
investment assets to be held in our portfolio and develop assets to be sold
upon completion. With over $1.2 billion in our development pipeline at December
31, 2006, we are encouraged about the long-term growth opportunities in our
business.

Key Performance Indicators

Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our
office and industrial properties (“Rental Operations”). The following
highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider critical for future
revenue growth. (All square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect
both wholly-owned properties and properties in joint ventures.)


Occupancy Analysis:

As discussed above, our ability to maintain
occupancy rates is a principal driver of our results of operations. The
following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in-service
portfolio of rental properties as of December 31  (in thousands, except percentage data):

We experienced continued strong occupancy in our in-service portfolio
with the overall increase driven primarily by a 3.1% increase in the occupancy

Lease Expiration and Renewals:

Our ability to maintain and grow occupancy rates
primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re-lease expiring space. The
following table reflects our in-service portfolio lease expiration schedule by
property type as of December 31, 2006. The table indicates square footage and

We renewed 79.9% and 74.3% of our leases up for renewal totaling approximately
7.5 million and 10.0 million square feet in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our
lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively
consistent at a 70-80% success rate. We do not presently expect this renewal
percentage in 2007 to differ from that experienced in 2006.

Future Development:

Another source of growth in earnings is the development
of additional properties. These properties should provide future earnings
through income upon sale or from Rental Operations growth as they are placed in
service. We had 10.6 million square feet of property under development with
total estimated costs of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006, compared to 9.0
million square feet and total costs of $658.7 million at December 31, 2005. We
have increased our development pipeline significantly through 2006 and will
continue to focus on the development side of our business in 2007.

Acquisition and Disposition
Activity:

We continued to selectively dispose of
non-strategic properties in 2006.  Sales
proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned held for rental properties
were $139.9 million, which included the disposition of our entire portfolio of
industrial properties in the Cleveland market. 
Our share of proceeds from sales of properties within unconsolidated
joint ventures, of which we have a less than 100% interest, totaled $91.9
million.  In 2005, proceeds from the
disposition of non-strategic properties totaled $1.1 billion for wholly owned
held for rental properties, as the result of the Industrial Portfolio Sale, and
$31.8 million for our share of property sales from unconsolidated joint
ventures.  Dispositions of wholly owned
properties developed for sale rather than rental resulted in $188.6 million in
proceeds in 2006 compared to $121.4 million in 2005.

In 2006, we acquired $948.4 million of income
producing properties and $436.7 million of undeveloped land compared to $295.6
million of income producing properties and $137.7 million of undeveloped land
in 2005.  We contributed 23 in service
properties from the Mark Winkler portfolio, with a book value of $381.6 million,
to two newly formed unconsolidated joint ventures in December 2006.

Overall, rental income from continuing operations
increased from $639.1 million in 2005 to $780.7 million in 2006. The following
table reconciles rental income from continuing operations by reportable segment
to total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended

Both of our reportable segments that comprise Rental
Operations (office and industrial) are within the real estate industry;
however, the same economic and industry conditions do not affect each segment
in the same manner. The primary causes of the increase in rental income from
continuing operations, with specific references to a particular segment when
applicable, are summarized below:

·

In
2006, we acquired 50 new properties and placed 27 development projects
in-service. These 2006 acquisitions and developments are the primary factor in
the overall increase in rental revenue for the year ended 2006 compared to 2005
as they provided incremental revenues of $73.8 million and $9.3 million
respectively. These acquisitions totaled $948.4 million on 8.6 million square
feet and were 99% leased at December 31, 2006.

·

Acquisitions
and developments that were placed in service in 2005 provided $15.8 million and
$11.2 million, respectively, of incremental revenue in 2006.

·

Our
in-service occupancy increased from 92.7% at December 31, 2005, to 92.9% at
December 31, 2006.

·

Rental
income includes lease termination fees. 
Lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to
terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term.
Lease termination fees increased from $7.3 million in 2005 to $16.1 million in
2006.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of
net income from investments in unconsolidated companies. These joint ventures
generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development.  These earnings increased from $29.5 million
in 2005 to $38.0 million in 2006. During 2006, our joint ventures sold 22
non-strategic buildings, with our share of the net gain recorded through equity
in earnings totaling $18.8 million. 
During the second quarter of 2005, one of our ventures sold three
buildings, with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings
totaling $11.1 million.

Rental
expenses and real estate taxes for 2006 have increased from 2005 by $30.4
million and $10.8 million, respectively, as the result of acquisition and
development activity in 2005 and 2006 as well as from our increase in occupancy
over the past two years.

Interest
Expense

Interest expense increased from $113.1 million in 2005
to $179.0 million in 2006, as a result of the following:

·

Interest
expense on the unsecured line of credit increased by $29.2 million from 2005 as
the result of increased borrowings throughout the year, as well as increased
interest rates.

·

Interest
expense on unsecured notes increased by $10.2 million as the result of an
overall increase in borrowings used mainly to fund acquisitions and
development.

·

Interest
expense on secured debt increased by $27.8 million as the result of the
increase in borrowings in 2006.

·

Amortization
of deferred financing fees increased by $2.4 million as the result of
additional borrowings in 2006.

·

Offsetting
the above increases, capitalized interest increased by $26.8 million as the
result of increased development activity.

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization increased from $215.4
million in 2005 to $244.1 million in 2006 as the result of increases in our
held-for-rental asset base from acquisitions and developments during 2005 and
2006.

Service
Operations

Service Operations primarily consist of sales of
properties developed or acquired with the intent to sell within a short period
of time and the leasing, management, construction and development services for
joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties.  These operations are heavily influenced by
the current state of the economy, as leasing and management fees are dependent
upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the
expansion of business operations. Service Operations earnings increased from
$44.3 million in 2005 to $53.2 million in 2006. 
The following are the factors related to the increase in Service
Operations earnings in 2006.


·

Our
Service Operations building development and sales program, whereby a building
is developed or repositioned by us and then sold, is a significant component of
earnings from service operations. During 2006, we generated pre-tax gains of
$44.6 million from the sale of nine properties compared to $29.9 million from
the sale of ten properties in 2005. Profit margins on these types of building
sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold, the
strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale, such as a
pre-contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open
market.

·

Partially
offsetting the increased 2006 gains from our Service Operations building
development and sales program was the effect of a decreased focus on
third-party construction services as well as the fact that in the first quarter
of 2005, we recognized $2.7 million of a non-recurring deferred gain associated
with the sale of our landscaping operations in 2001.

General
and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased from
$31.0 million in 2005 to $35.8 million in 2006. General and administrative
expenses consist of two components. The first component is direct expenses that
are not attributable to specific assets such as legal fees, external audit
fees, marketing costs, investor relations expenses and other corporate
overhead. The second component is the unallocated overhead costs associated
with the operation of our owned properties and Service Operations, including
construction, leasing and maintenance operations. Overhead costs not allocated
to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. The
increase in general and administrative expenses from 2005 was largely
attributable to an increase in our overall pool of overhead costs to support
our current and anticipated future growth.

Discontinued
Operations

The results of operations for properties sold during
the year or designated as held-for-sale at the end of the period are required
to be classified as discontinued operations. The property specific components
of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental
revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes, allocated interest expense,
depreciation expense and minority interest, as well as the net gain or loss on
the disposition of properties.

We classified the operations of 308 buildings as
discontinued operations as of December 31, 2006. These 308 buildings consist of
273 industrial, 32 office and three retail properties. As a result, we
classified net income from operations, net of minority interest, of $8.4 million,
$15.9 million and $28.6 million as net income from discontinued operations for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Of these properties, 21 were sold during 2006, 234
properties were sold during 2005, 41 properties were sold during 2004, and 12
operating properties are classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2006. The
gains on disposal of these properties, net of impairment adjustment and
minority interest, of $42.1 million, $204.3 million and $23.9 million for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are also reported
in discontinued operations.


Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 to Year
Ended December 31, 2004

Rental Income from Continuing Operations

Overall, rental income from continuing operations
increased from $582.2 million in 2004 to $639.1 million in 2005. The following
table reconciles rental income from continuing operations by reportable segment
to total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively (in thousands):

Both of our reportable segments that comprise Rental
Operations (office and industrial) are within the real estate industry;
however, the same economic and industry conditions do not affect each segment
in the same manner. The primary causes of the increase in rental income from
continuing operations, with specific references to a particular segment when
applicable, are summarized below:

·

In
2005, we acquired nine new properties and placed 17 development projects
in-service. These acquisitions and developments are the primary factor in the
$56.8 million overall increase in rental revenue for the year ended 2005,
compared to 2004.

·

The
nine property acquisitions provided revenues of $21.0 million. These
acquisitions totaled $307.5 million on 2.2 million square feet and were 86.5%
leased at December 31, 2005. Revenues from acquisitions that occurred in 2004
totaled $31.8 million in 2005 compared to $13.4 million in 2004.

·

Developments
placed in service in 2005 provided revenues of $5.8 million. Revenues from
developments placed in service in 2004 increased $9.9 million to $17.4 million
in 2005.

·

Our
in-service occupancy increased from 90.9% at December 31, 2004, to 92.7% at
December 31, 2005.

·

Rental
income includes lease termination fees. 
Lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to
terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term.
Lease termination fees in 2005 continued to steadily decrease as a result of
improving market conditions. Lease termination fees decreased from $14.7
million in 2004 to $7.3 million in 2005.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of
net income from investments in unconsolidated companies. These joint ventures
generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development.  These earnings increased from $21.6 million
in 2004 to $29.5 million in 2005. During the second quarter of 2005, one of our
ventures sold three buildings with our share of the net gain recorded through
equity in earnings totaling $11.1 million.

Rental and
real estate tax expenses for 2005, as compared to 2004, have increased as a
result of our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions as well as our increase in occupancy. This
increase in rental and real estate taxes was in line with our expectations.

Interest
Expense

Interest expense increased from $104.0 million in 2004
to $113.1 million in 2005 largely as the result of increased interest expense
from additional unsecured borrowings.

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased from
$171.8 million in 2004 to $215.4 million in 2005 as the result of increases in
our held-for-rental base from acquisitions and developments during 2004 and
2005.

Service
Operations

Service Operations primarily consist of building sales
and the leasing, management, construction and development services for joint
venture properties and properties owned by third parties.  These operations are heavily influenced by
the current state of the economy as leasing and management fees are dependent
upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the
expansion of business operations. Service Operations earnings increased from
$27.7 million in 2004 to $44.3 million in 2005. 
The increase reflects higher construction volumes partially offset by
increased staffing costs in 2005. Other factors impacting service operations
are discussed below.

·

Our
Service Operations development and sales program, whereby a building is
developed or repositioned by us and then sold, is a significant component of
construction and development income. During 2005, we generated pre-tax gains of
$29.9 million from the sale of 10 properties compared to $24.2 million from the
sale of six properties in 2004. Profit margins on these types of building sales
fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold, the strength of
the underlying tenant and nature of the sale, such as a pre-contracted purchase
price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market.

·

In
2005, we experienced an increase in our third-party construction business as
evidenced by the increase in general contractor revenues in 2005 over 2004. We
achieved a slight increase in our profit margins during 2005, which reflected
improved pricing in certain markets and our ability to select more profitable
projects as resources are re-positioned to our increasing held-for-investment
development pipeline.

·

In
the first quarter of 2005, we recognized $2.7 million of a non-recurring
deferred gain associated with the sale of our landscaping operations in 2001.
The gain was deferred as a result of future performance provisions contained in
the original sales agreement. As a result of contract renegotiations effective
in the first quarter of 2005, all future performance provisions were removed
and the deferred gain was recognized.


General
and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased from
$29.5 million in 2004 to $31.0 million in 2005. General and administrative
expenses consist of two components. The first component is direct expenses not
attributable to specific assets such as legal fees, external audit fees,
marketing costs, investor relations expenses and other corporate overhead. The second
component is the unallocated overhead costs associated with the operation of
our owned properties and Service Operations, including construction, leasing
and maintenance operations. Overhead costs not allocated to these operations
are charged to general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and
administrative expenses is primarily the result of an increase in payroll
expenses associated with long-term compensation plans and an increase in the
number of employees to support our overall growth.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reported period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently
subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are
therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and
experience. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further
discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed
the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and
discussed them with our Audit Committee and independent auditors. The following
accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the
financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported
amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:

Accounting for Joint Ventures:

We
analyze our investments in joint ventures under Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,

to determine if the joint venture is
considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation. To the
extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities, we
further assess under the guidelines of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a
General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited
Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF
04-5”), Statement of Position 78-9,

Accounting
for Investments in Real Estate Ventures;

Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial
Statements

and FASB No. 94,

Consolidation of All Majority-Owned
Subsidiaries,

to determine if the venture should be consolidated. We
have equity interests ranging from 10%-67% in joint ventures that own and
operate rental properties and hold land for development. We consolidate those
joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or substantial
participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by the ability of the
general partner to manage day-to-day operations, refinance debt and sell the
assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and
inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner. We use the
equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have
control over operating and financial polices. Under the equity method of
accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance
sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we
use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

Cost Capitalization:

Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with
and incremental to the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real
estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project
costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the
property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We believe
the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining
substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard
in the real estate industry. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is
based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.


We also capitalize direct and indirect costs,
including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods after
construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being
incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and
activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization
is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has
been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We
cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after
the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or
when the property attains 90% occupancy. 
In addition, all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new
leases or lease renewals are capitalized.

In assessing the amount of indirect costs to be
capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department
basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e.,
construction, development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is
not warranted  (i.e., property
management, maintenance, acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate
functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time
between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are
made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity.
Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department
are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the
same proportion as payroll costs.

To ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized,
the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are
limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards consist of a
percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the
total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease. These standards are
derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel
in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards
ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful
projects or leasing activities are not capitalized.

Impairment of Real Estate
Investments:

We evaluate our real estate investments upon
occurrence of significant changes in the operations, but not less than
annually, to assess whether any impairment indications are present that affect
the recovery of the recorded value. If any real estate investment is considered
to be impaired, a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to
its estimated fair value. We utilize the guidelines established under SFAS No.
144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long Lived Assets

(“SFAS 144”), to determine if
impairment conditions exist. Under SFAS 144, we review the expected
undiscounted cash flows of each property in our held for rental portfolio to
determine if there are any indications of impairment of a property. The review
of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated
occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value. In addition to
reviewing anticipated cash flows, we assess other factors such as changes in
business climate and legal factors that may affect the ultimate value of the
property. These assumptions are subjective and the anticipated cash flows may
not ultimately be achieved.

Real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of their carrying value amount or the fair value less estimated cost
to sell.

Acquisition of Real Estate Property:

In accordance with SFAS 141,

Business
Combinations

, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties
to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair
values.

The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant
improvements and land) is based upon management’s determination of the value of
the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to
those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management include
an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering
current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. The remaining
purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets
consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value
of in-place leases and the value of customer relationships.


·

The
value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place
lease is determined based upon the present value (using an interest rate which
reflects the risks associated with the lease) of the difference between (i) the
contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term
and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current
fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated
to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the
balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the
balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of
the respective leases.

·

The
total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values
and to customer relationship values, based upon management’s assessment of
their respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred
leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the
remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer
relationship, as applicable.

Valuation of Receivables:

We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the
collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we
perform in-house credit review and analysis on major existing tenants and all
significant leases before they are executed. We have established the following
procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding
receivables and record allowances:

·

We
maintain a tenant “watch list” containing a list of significant tenants for
which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk. Various
factors such as late rent payments, lease or debt instrument defaults, and
indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when
determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list.

·

As
a matter of policy, we reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight-line
rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90 days.

·

Straight-line
rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant
identified as a potential long-term risk, regardless of the status of rent
receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

Revenue Recognition on Construction
Contracts:

We recognize income on construction contracts
where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method.
Using this method, profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the
overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts. A portion
of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage
of completion of the construction contract. Cumulative revenues recognized may
be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in
time during a contract’s term. This revenue recognition method involves
inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced
through approval and monitoring processes.

With regard to critical accounting policies,
management has discussed the following with the Audit Committee:

·

Criteria
for identifying and selecting;

·

Methodology
in applying; and

·

Impact
on the financial statements.

The Audit Committee has reviewed the critical
accounting policies we identified.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity
requirements over the next twelve months, including payments of dividends and
distributions, as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to
maintaining our current real estate assets, primarily through the following:

·

working
capital;

·

net
cash provided by operating activities; and

·

proceeds
received from real estate dispositions


Although we historically have not used any other
sources of funds to pay for recurring capital expenditures on our current real
estate investments, we may rely on the temporary use of borrowings or property
disposition proceeds needed to fund such expenditures during periods of high
leasing volume.

We expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements,
such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities, refinancing of long-term debt,
preferred share redemptions, the retirement of unsecured notes and amounts
outstanding under the unsecured credit facility, property acquisitions,
financing of development activities and other non-recurring capital
improvements, primarily from the following sources:

·

issuance
of additional equity, including common and preferred stock;

·

issuance
of additional debt securities;

·

undistributed
cash provided by operating activities, if any; and

·

proceeds
received from real estate dispositions.

Rental Operations

We believe our principal source of liquidity, cash
flows from Rental Operations, provides a stable source of cash to fund
operational expenses. We believe this cash-based revenue stream is
substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for periodic
straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market
rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally
received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue
recognition.

We are subject to risks of decreased occupancy through
market conditions, as well as tenant defaults and bankruptcies, and potential
reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, which would
result in reduced cash flow from operations. However, we believe that these
risks are mitigated by our relatively strong market presence in most of our locations
and the fact that we perform in-house credit review and analysis on major
tenants and all significant leases before they are executed.

Credit Facility

We had one unsecured line of credit available at
December 31, 2006, summarized as follows (in thousands):

LIBOR
  + .525%

$

We use this line of credit to fund development
activities, acquire additional rental properties and provide working capital.
The line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from
financial institutions that participate in the line, at rates lower than the
stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.  Interest rates on the amounts outstanding on
the unsecured line of credit as of December 31, 2006, ranged from LIBOR +.17%
to LIBOR +.525% (equal to 5.52% and 5.875% as of December 31, 2006.) The line
of credit also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial
ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to variable
interest indebtedness, consolidated net worth and debt-to-market
capitalization. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all
financial covenants under our line of credit.

Debt and Equity Securities

On July 31, 2006, we filed with the SEC an automatic
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from
time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock,
preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. From time to time, we expect
to issue additional securities under this new automatic shelf registration
statement to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental
properties and to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long-term
debt upon maturity.


On February 18, 2007, we
filed a resale shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to
11,747,135 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exchange or redemption
of the Exchangeable Notes.  Recipients of
such common stock, whom we refer to as the “selling shareholders,” may use the
prospectus filed as part of the resale shelf registration statement to resell,
from time to time, the shares of our common stock that we may issue to them
upon the exchange or redemption of the Exchangeable Notes.  Additional selling shareholders may be named
by future prospectus supplements.

We registered the
offering and resale of such shares to allow the selling shareholders to sell
any or all of their shares of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange or in
private transactions as described in the prospectus. The registration of the
shares does not necessarily mean that the selling shareholders will exchange
their Exchangeable Notes for our common stock, that upon any exchange or
redemption of the Exchangeable Notes we will elect, in our sole and absolute
discretion, to exchange or redeem some or all of the Exchangeable Notes for
shares of our common stock rather than cash, or that any shares of our common
stock received upon exchange or redemption of the Exchangeable Notes will be
sold by the selling shareholders under the prospectus or otherwise.

The indenture governing
our unsecured notes also requires us to comply with financial ratios and other
covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such
covenants as of December 31, 2006.

Sale
of Real Estate Assets

We utilize sales of real
estate assets as an additional source of liquidity. We pursue opportunities to
sell real estate assets at favorable prices to capture value created by us as
well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio by recycling sale
proceeds into new properties with greater value creation opportunities.

Uses of
Liquidity

Our principal uses of
liquidity include the following:

·

Property
investments;

·

Recurring
leasing/capital costs;

·

Dividends
and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;

·

Long-term
debt maturities; and

·

Other

Dividends and Distributions

In order to qualify as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must currently distribute at least 90%
of our taxable income to shareholders. We paid dividends per share of $1.89,
$1.87 and $1.85 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. We also paid a one-time special dividend of $1.05 per share in
2005 as a result of the significant gain realized from the Industrial Portfolio
Sale. We expect to continue to distribute taxable earnings to meet the
requirements to maintain our REIT status. However, distributions are declared
at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash
available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and
such other factors, as our board of directors deems relevant.

Debt
Maturities

Debt outstanding at
December 31, 2006, totaled $4.1 billion with a weighted average interest rate

unsecured debt, $317.0 million outstanding on our unsecured line of credit, and
$662.5 million of secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2006. Scheduled
principal amortization and maturities of such debt totaled $1.1 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2006.

Historical
Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents
were $68.5 million and $26.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The following highlights significant changes in net cash
associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in
millions):

Operating
Activities

Cash flows from
operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational
requirements of our rental operations and Service Operations activities. The
receipt of rental income from rental operations continues to provide the
primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows. In addition, we
develop buildings with the intent to sell them at or soon after completion,
which provides another significant source of operating cash flow activity.


·

During
the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred Service Operations building
development costs of $273.5 million, compared to $83.4 million and $43.1
million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
difference is reflective of the increased activity in our held-for-sale
pipeline. The pipeline of held-for-sale projects under construction as of
December 31, 2006, has anticipated costs of $667.4 million.

·

We
sold nine Service Operations buildings in 2006 compared to ten in 2005 and six
in 2004, receiving net proceeds of $181.8 million, $113.0 million and $72.7
million, respectively and recognized pre-tax gains of $49.0 million, $29.9
million and $24.2 million, respectively.

Investing
Activities

Investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity.
Development and acquisition activities typically generate additional rental
revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements. Highlights of
significant cash uses are as follows:

·

Sales
of land and depreciated property provided $180.8 million in net proceeds in
2006, compared to $1.1 billion in 2005 and $178.3 million in 2004.  In addition, during 2006 we received
distributions of $21.2 million for our share of proceeds on the sales of land
and depreciable property within three of our joint ventures.  The Industrial Portfolio Sale provided $955
million of the $1.1 billion of proceeds received in 2005. We continue to
dispose of non-strategic and older properties as part of our capital recycling
program to fund acquisitions and new developments while improving the overall
quality of our investment portfolio.

·

Development
costs for our held for rental portfolio increased to $385.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006, from $210.0 million and $145.6 million for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Management anticipated
this continued increase, as a commitment to development activity was part of
our strategic plan for 2006 and continues to be for 2007.

·

During
2006, we paid cash of $735.3 million for real estate acquisitions, compared to
$285.3 million in 2005 and $204.4 million in 2004. The most significant
activity in 2006 consisted of the purchase of the Mark Winkler Portfolio of
suburban office and light industrial properties and undeveloped land in the
Washington, D.C. area for $867.6 million ($713.5 million paid in cash) and a
portfolio of industrial properties in Savannah, Georgia for $196.2 million
($125.9 million paid in cash at closing).

·

In
2006, we paid cash of $435.9 million for undeveloped land, compared to $135.8
million in 2005 and $113.4 million in 2004. These acquisitions provide us
greater opportunities to use our development and construction expertise in the
improving economic cycle.

Financing Activities

The following significant items highlight fluctuations in net cash
provided by financing activities:

·

In
January 2006, we received approximately $177.7 million in net proceeds from the
issuance of our Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares. These
preferred shares bear a dividend yield of 6.95%. We applied a portion of the
net proceeds from the Series M preferred shares issuance to redeem $75.0
million of Series I preferred shares in February, which had an 8.45% dividend
rate.

·

In
February 2006, we obtained a $700.0 million secured term loan, which was priced
at LIBOR +.525%. The proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of the Mark
Winkler Portfolio in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and the loan was
secured by these properties.  This term
loan was paid in full in August 2006 with proceeds from the issuance of senior
unsecured debt as described below.

·

In
February and March 2006, we issued $150.0 million of 5.50% senior unsecured
notes due in 2016. A portion of the proceeds were used to retire our $100.0
million 6.72% puttable option reset securities. The remaining cash proceeds
were used to fund costs associated with the issuance of debt and to repay
amounts outstanding under our line of credit.

·

In
June 2006, we received approximately $106.3 million in net proceeds from the
issuance of our Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares.  These preferred shares bear a dividend yield
of 7.25%.


·

In
August 2006, we issued $450.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due in
2017 and $250.0 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2011.  The proceeds from these issuances were used
to pay off the $700.0 million secured term loan as described above.

·

In
November 2006, we issued $319.0 million of 5.91% debt due in 2016 secured by
certain of our in-service real estate properties.

·

In
November 2006, we issued $575.0 million of Exchangeable Notes, which will pay
interest semiannually at a rate of 3.75% per annum and mature in December 2011.

·

In
December 2006, we repaid our $250 million LIBOR +.26% Senior Unsecured Notes.

Credit Ratings

We are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our
senior unsecured notes from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investor Service and
Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group. Currently, Fitch and Standard and Poor’s
have assigned a rating of BBB+ and Moody’s Investors has assigned a rating of
Baa1 to our senior notes.

We also received investment grade credit ratings from the same rating
agencies on our preferred stock.  Fitch
and Standard and Poor’s have assigned a preferred stock rating of BBB and Moody’s
Investors has assigned a preferred stock rating of Baa2 to our preferred stock.

These senior notes and preferred stock ratings could change based upon,
among other things, our results of operations and financial condition.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to
capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to manage the
volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate
hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

In August 2005, we
entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward-starting
interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated
debt offerings in 2007. The swaps qualify for hedge accounting, with any
changes in fair value recorded in accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”).
At December 31, 2006, the fair value of these swaps was approximately $9.9
million in an asset position as the effective rates of the swaps were lower
than current interest rates at December 31, 2006.

In March 2005, we
entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward-starting
interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated
debt offerings in 2006. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any
changes in fair value recorded in OCI. 
In March 2006, we issued $150.0 million of 5.50% senior unsecured notes
due 2016 and terminated a corresponding amount of the cash flow hedges
designated for this transaction. The settlement amount paid of approximately
$800,000 will be recognized to earnings through interest expense ratably over
the life of the senior unsecured notes and the ineffective portion of the hedge
was insignificant.  In August 2006, we
issued $450.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $250.0
million of 5.63% senior unsecured notes due 2011 and terminated the remaining
$150.0 million of cash flow hedges.  The
settlement amount received of approximately $1.6 million will be recognized to
earnings through a reduction of interest expense ratably over the lives of the
senior unsecured notes. The ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant.

In June 2004, we
simultaneously entered into three forward-starting interest rate swaps
aggregating $144.3 million, which effectively fixed the rate on financing
expected in 2004 at 5.346%, plus our credit spread over the swap rate. The
swaps qualified for hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair value were
recorded in OCI. In August 2004, we settled these three swaps when we issued
$250.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of
6.33%, due in 2014. We paid $6.9 million to unwind the swaps, which is
amortized from OCI into interest expense over the life of the new 6.33% senior
unsecured notes.


The effectiveness of our forward-starting hedge
instruments will be evaluated throughout their lives using the hypothetical
derivative method under which the change in fair value of the actual swap
designated as the hedging instrument is compared to the change in fair value of
a hypothetical swap.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments
in Unconsolidated Companies

We have equity interests ranging from 10% — 67% in
unconsolidated companies that own and operate rental properties and hold land
for development. The equity method of

accounting

(see Critical Accounting Policies) is used for these investments in
which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,
over operating and financial policies. As a result, the assets and liabilities
of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet.

Our investments in and advances to unconsolidated
companies represents approximately 9% of our total assets as of December 31,
2006. These investments provide several benefits to us, including increased
market share, tenant and property diversification and an additional source of
capital to fund real estate projects.

companies for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively  (in thousands, except percentage data):

Related Party Transactions

We provide property management, leasing, construction and other tenant
related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests.
For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, we received
from these unconsolidated companies management fees of $4.4 million, $4.8
million and $4.9 million, leasing fees of $2.9 million, $4.3 million and $2.6
million and construction and development fees of $19.1 million, $2.0 million
and $1.5 million. We recorded these fees at market rates and eliminated our
ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

We
have guaranteed the repayment of $79.6 million of economic development bonds
issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments.
We will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that
incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the
bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will
be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these
guarantees.

We also have
guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of four of our
unconsolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on
these loans was approximately $129.0 million. Management believes that the
value of the real estate exceeds the loan balance and that we will not be
required to satisfy these guarantees.

We have entered
into agreements, subject to the completion of due diligence requirements,
resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing
conditions, for the future acquisition of land totaling $36.1 million.

In October 2000,
we sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair
value of $487.0 million to a joint venture (Dugan Realty LLC) in which we have
a 50% interest and recognized a net gain of $35.2 million. In connection with
this transaction, the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to
a $50.0 million interest in the joint venture to us in exchange for our common
stock or cash (at our option), subject to certain timing and other
restrictions. As a result of this put option, we deferred $10.2 million of gain
on sale of depreciated property and recorded a $50.0 million liability.

We
renewed all of our major insurance policies in 2006. These policies include
coverage for acts of terrorism for our properties. We believe that this
insurance provides adequate coverage against normal insurance risks and that
any loss experienced would not have a significant impact on our liquidity,
financial position, or results of operations.

We are subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
business.  In the opinion of management,
the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not
materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of
operations.


Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

,

an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”).  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return.  The
Interpretation also provides guidance on description, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  FIN 48 becomes effective on January 1, 2007
and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our 2007 financial
position, results of operations, or liquidity.

In September 2006,
the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements

(“SAB 108”). SAB 108 provides guidance regarding the
process of quantifying the materiality of financial statement misstatements. We
adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006 with no effect to our financial
statements.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our
line of credit and long-term debt borrowings. Our interest rate risk management
objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash
flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we
borrow primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury locks in order to
mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not
enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The
table below presents the principal amounts (in thousands) of the expected
annual maturities, weighted average interest rates for the average debt
outstanding in the specified period, fair values and other terms required to
evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.

As the table incorporates only
those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2006, it does not consider those
exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our
ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will
depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at
that time, and interest rates.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

We conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our “disclosure
controls and procedures” as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report. The controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer.

Attached as
exhibits to this Annual Report are certifications of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rule
13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This Controls and Procedures
section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to
in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the
certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15f under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) are controls and other procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on the
disclosure controls and procedures evaluation referenced above, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end
of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective.

Management’s
annual report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm are included in Item 15 of Part
IV under the headings “Management’s Report on Internal Control” and “Report of

likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control

We, as management of Duke Realty Corporation and its
subsidiaries (“Duke”), are responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedure that:

·

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of
the company;

·

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and

·

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on the
control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control — Integrated
Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of
December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is effective
based on these criteria.

The independent registered public accounting firm of KPMG
LLP, as auditors of Duke’s consolidated financial statements, has issued an
attestation report on management’s assessment of Duke’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm

The
Shareholders and Directors of

Duke
Realty Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Duke
Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
shareholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2006. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule III. These
consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule III, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February
28, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and
the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Realty Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control that Duke Realty
Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Duke Realty
Corporation and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Duke Realty
Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Duke Realty Corporation and
Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash
flows and shareholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2006 and related financial statement schedule III, and our
report dated February 28, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements and related financial statement schedule III.

The Company

Our rental
operations are conducted through Duke Realty Limited Partnership (“DRLP”). We
owned approximately 91.5% of the common partnership interests of DRLP (“Units”)
at December 31, 2006. The remaining Units in DRLP are redeemable for shares of
our common stock on a one-to-one basis and earn dividends at the same rate as
shares of our common stock. We conduct Service Operations through Duke Realty
Services LLC and Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership, of which we are the
sole general partner and of which DRLP is the sole limited partner. We also
conduct Service Operations through Duke Construction Limited Partnership, which
is effectively 100% owned by DRLP. The consolidated financial statements
include our accounts and our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries, and the
terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Duke Realty Corporation and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) and those entities owned or controlled by the Company.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our
controlled subsidiaries. The equity

interests

in these controlled subsidiaries not owned by us are reflected as
minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements. Investments in entities that we do not control through
majority voting interest or where the other owner has substantial participating
rights are not consolidated and are reflected as investments in unconsolidated
companies under the equity method of reporting.

Reclassifications

Certain 2005 and 2004 balances have been reclassified to conform to the
2006 presentation.

Real Estate Investments

Rental real property, including land, land improvements, buildings and
building improvements, are included in real estate investments and are
generally stated at cost. Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on
the straight-line method over their estimated life not to exceed 40 and 15
years, respectively, and tenant improvement costs are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the term of the related lease.

Direct and certain indirect costs clearly associated with and
incremental to the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real
estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. In addition, all
leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are
capitalized. We capitalize a portion of our indirect costs associated with our
construction, development and leasing efforts. In assessing the amount of
direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made based on
estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. We do not
capitalize any costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects.

We capitalize direct and indirect project costs associated with the
initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use. In addition, we capitalize costs,
including real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities, that have been allocated
to vacant space based on the square footage of the portion of the building not
held available for immediate occupancy during the extended lease-up periods
after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being
incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities
incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also
discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been
completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up
periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the
building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.

Construction in process and land held for development are included in
real estate investments and are stated at cost. Real estate investments also
include our equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and
operate rental properties and hold land for development.

We first analyze our investments in
joint ventures under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities

(“FIN 46(R)”), to determine if the joint
venture is a variable interest entity and would require consolidation. To the
extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities, we
further assess under the guidelines of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a
General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited
Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF
04-5”), Statement of Position 78-9,

Accounting
for Investments in Real Estate Ventures

; Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements,

and FASB No. 94,

Consolidation of All
Majority-Owned Subsidiaries

, to determine if the venture should be
consolidated.

The equity method of
accounting is used for those investments in which we have the ability to
exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial
policies. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments and
the underlying equity in net assets is amortized to equity in earnings of
unconsolidated companies over the depreciable life of the property, generally
40 years. Distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures related to
the operations of the properties in the joint ventures are reflected as an
operating activity in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Distributions
received from unconsolidated joint ventures related to property sales or other
capital transactions are reflected as an investing activity in our Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

Properties held for rental are individually evaluated for impairment
when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of
expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis) from a rental property
over its anticipated holding period is less than its historical net cost basis.
Upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred, a loss is recorded
to reduce the net book value of that property to its fair market value.
Properties to be disposed of are reported at the lower of net historical cost
basis or the estimated fair market value, less the estimated costs to sell.
Once a property is designated as held for disposal, no further depreciation
expense is recorded.

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible
and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, based
on all pertinent information available and adjusted based on changes in that
information in no event to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The

allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is
based upon management’s determination of the value of the property as if it
were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by
independent appraisers. Factors considered by management include an estimate of
carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market
conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. The remaining purchase price
is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the
above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place
leases and the value of customer relationships.

The value
allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease
is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects
the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i)
the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining
term and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using
fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated
to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the
balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the
balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of
the respective leases.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The total amount
of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and to
customer relationship values based upon management’s assessment of their
respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and
other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of
the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as
applicable.

Cash Equivalents

Investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are
classified as cash equivalents.

Valuation of Receivables

We reserve the entire receivable balance,
including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90
days. Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant with long-term risk,
regardless of the status of rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as
necessary.

Deferred Costs

Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are amortized to
interest expense on the straight-line method, which approximates a constant
spread over the term of the related loan. All direct and indirect costs,
including

estimated

internal costs,
associated with the leasing of real estate investments owned by us are
capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease. We include lease
incentive costs, which are payments made on behalf of a tenant to sign a lease,
in deferred leasing costs and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the
respective lease terms as a reduction of rental revenues. We include as lease
incentives amounts funded to construct tenant improvements owned by the tenant.
Unamortized costs are charged to expense upon the early termination of the
lease or upon early payment of the financing.

Revenues

Rental Operations

The timing of revenue recognition under an operating lease is
determined based upon ownership of the tenant improvements. If we are the owner
of the tenant improvements, revenue recognition commences after the
improvements are completed and the tenant takes possession or control of the
space. In contrast, if we determine that the tenant allowances we are funding
are lease incentives, then we commence revenue recognition when possession or
control of the space is turned over to the tenant. Rental income

from

leases with scheduled rental increases during
their terms is recognized on a straight-line basis.

Revenue is recognized on payments received from tenants for early lease
terminations after all necessary criteria have been met in accordance with SFAS
No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

.

Service Operations

Management fees
are based on a percentage of rental receipts of properties managed and are
recognized as the rental receipts are collected. Maintenance fees are based
upon established hourly rates and are recognized as th

e services are performed. Construction management and development fees
represent fee based third-party contracts and are

recognized as earned
based on the terms of the contract, which approximates the percentage of
completion method.

We recognize
income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the
percentage of completion method. Using this

method, profits are recorded based on our estimates of the percentage of
completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under
the contracts reach a point


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The
percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract
expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. Changes in job performance,
job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and
income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

Unbilled receivables on construction contracts totaled $32.4 million
and $10.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Property
Sales

Gains on sales of all properties are recognized in accordance with SFAS
No. 66,

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.

Gains from sales of depreciated property are included in discontinued
operations and the proceeds from the sale of these held-for-rental properties
are classified in the investing activities section of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

Gains or losses from our sale of properties that were developed or
repositioned with the intent to sell and not for long-term rental are
classified as gain on sale of Service Operation properties in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. All activities and proceeds received from the
development and sale of these buildings are classified in the operating
activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Net Income Per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income
available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share is
computed by dividing the sum of net income available for common shareholders
and the minority interest in earnings allocable to Units not owned by us, by
the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and
minority Units outstanding, including any dilutive potential common equivalents
for the period.

A joint venture partner in one of our unconsolidated companies has the
option to convert a portion of its ownership to our common shares. The effect
of this option on earnings per share was anti-dilutive for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

We issued
Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Exchangeable Notes”) in 2006. These Exchangeable
Notes had no effect on diluted earnings per share, as the conversion option was
not in the money.

Federal Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of
organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to
distribute at least 90% of our adjusted taxable income to our stockholders.
Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to maintain
our REIT status. As a REIT, we are entitled to a tax

deduction for some or all of the dividends we pay to shareholders.
Accordingly

, we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as
long as we distribute an amount equal to or in excess of our taxable income

currently to shareholders.  We are also generally subject to federal
income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to its
shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be
subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for
four subsequent taxable years.

REIT qualification reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of state
and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the
operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a
dividends paid deduction and are subject to corporate federal, state and local
income taxes. As a REIT, we may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes
if we engage in certain types of transactions.

The following table reconciles our net income to taxable income before
the dividends paid deduction for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and

Stock Based Compensation

For all issuances of stock-based awards prior to 2002, we applied the
recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

(“APB 25”), and related interpretations, in accounting for
our stock-based compensation.

Accordingly, for stock options granted prior to 2002, no compensation
expense is reflected in net income as all options granted had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common shares on the date of the
grant.

Effective January 1, 2002, we prospectively adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS
123”), and applied SFAS 123 to all awards granted after January 1, 2002.

The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to all stock-based
employee compensation for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,

,
(“SFAS 123(R)”), using the modified prospective application method. Under this
method, as of  January 1, 2006, we
applied the provisions of SFAS 123(R) to new and modified awards, as well as to
the nonvested portion of awards granted before the required effective date and
outstanding at such time.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

We periodically enter into certain interest rate protection agreements
to effectively convert or cap floating rate debt to a fixed rate, and to hedge
anticipated future financing transactions, both of which qualify for cash flow
hedge accounting treatment. Net amounts paid or received under these agreements
are recognized as an adjustment to the interest expense of the corresponding
debt. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

If a derivative
qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is
recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective,
while the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value is
recognized in earnings. We estimate the fair value of derivative instruments
using standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow
analysis, option pricing models and termination cost at each balance sheet
date.  For all hedging relationships, we
formally document the hedging relationship and its risk-management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged
item, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument’s
effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and
retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make
a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(3)

Significant Acquisitions and Dispositions

In February 2006, we acquired the majority of a Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area portfolio of suburban office and light industrial properties
(the “Mark Winkler Portfolio”). The assets acquired for a purchase price of
approximately $867.6 million are comprised of 32 in-service properties with
approximately 2.9 million square feet for rental, 166 acres of undeveloped
land, as well as certain related assets of the Mark Winkler Company, a real
estate management company. The acquisition was financed primarily through
assumed mortgage loans and new borrowings.

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their
estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, as summarized below:

representing real estate investments and acquired lease related intangible
assets to two new unconsolidated subsidiaries. The remaining nine in-service
properties are classified and accounted for as held-for-sale. The results of
operations of the acquired properties since the date of acquisition have been
included in continuing operations, rather than discontinued operations, based
on our intention to sell the majority of our ownership interest in the
properties to entities in which we will retain a minority equity ownership
interest.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In the third quarter of 2006, we finalized the purchase of a portfolio of
industrial real estate properties in Savannah, Georgia. We completed a majority
of the purchase in January 2006. The assets acquired for a purchase price of
approximately $196.2 million are comprised of 18 buildings with approximately
5.1 million square feet for rental as well as over 60 acres of undeveloped
land.  The acquisition was financed in
part through assumed mortgage loans. The results of operations for the acquired
properties since the date of acquisition have been included in continuing
rental operations in our consolidated financial statements.

We acquired total income producing real estate related assets of $948.4
million, $295.6 million, and $246.2 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.

On September 29, 2005, we completed the sale of a portfolio of 212 real
estate properties, consisting of approximately 14.1 million square feet of
primarily light distribution and service center properties and approximately 50
acres of undeveloped land (the “Industrial Portfolio Sale”). The purchase price
totaled $983 million, of which we received net proceeds of $955.0 million after
the settlement of certain liabilities and transaction costs. Portions of the
proceeds were used to pay down $423.0 million of outstanding debt on our $500.0
million unsecured line of credit and the entire outstanding balance on our
$400.0 million term loan. The operations for 2005 and 2004 and the gain for
2005 associated with the properties in the Industrial Portfolio Sale have been
reclassified to discontinued operations. As a result of the taxable income
generated by the sale, a one-time special cash dividend of $1.05 per share was
paid to our common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Related Party Transactions

We provide

property

management, leasing, construction
and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have
equity interests. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we
received management fees of $4.4 million, $4.8 million and $4.9 million,
leasing fees of $2.9 million, $4.3 million and $2.6 million and construction
and development fees of $19.1 million, $2.0 million and $1.5 million,
respectively, from these companies. These fees approximate market rates and we
eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated
financial statements.

At December 31, 2006, we classified 12 properties as held-for-sale and
included in discontinued operations. Additionally, we have classified nine of the
remaining in-service properties from the Mark Winkler Portfolio, as well as six
additional properties, as held-for-sale. 
However, the results of these 15 properties are included in continuing
operations, either based on our present intention to sell the majority of our
ownership interest in the properties to entities in which we will retain a
minority equity ownership interest or because the results of operations for the
properties are immaterial. The following table illustrates the aggregate
balance sheet of the aforementioned 12 properties included in discontinued
operations, as well as the 15 held-for-sale properties whose results are
included in continuing operations at December 31, 2006 (in thousands):

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We allocate interest expense to discontinued
operations and have included such interest expense in computing net income from
discontinued operations. Interest expense allocable to discontinued operations
includes interest on any debt on secured properties included in discontinued
operations and an allocable share of our consolidated unsecured interest
expense for unencumbered properties. The allocation of unsecured interest expense
to discontinued operations was based upon the gross book value of the
discontinued operations unencumbered population as it related to our entire
unencumbered population.

We recorded
impairment adjustments on depreciable properties of $266,000, $3.7 million and
$180,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The line of credit also contains various financial
covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and defined levels of
performance, including those related to variable rate indebtedness,
consolidated net worth and debt-to-market capitalization. As of December 31,
2006, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our line of
credit.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We
took the following actions during the year ended December 31, 2006, relevant to
our indebtedness:

·

In January 2006, we renewed our unsecured line of
credit. The new facility provides borrowing capacity up to $1.0 billion and,
subject to certain conditions, may be increased to $1.3 billion. Under the new
facility, which replaced the previous unsecured line of credit agreement, the
interest rate was reduced, the borrowing capacity was increased by $500.0
million and the maturity date was extended to January 25, 2010.

·

To finance the acquisition of the Mark Winkler
Portfolio, we obtained a $700.0 million term loan with an interest rate of
LIBOR + .525%, secured by certain of the acquired real estate properties. This
term loan was paid in full in August 2006 with proceeds from the issuance of
senior unsecured debt as described below.

·

In conjunction with our real estate acquisitions,
we assumed $221.6 million of mortgage loans, of which we received $10.5 million
of proceeds directly. The assumed mortgage loans bear interest at rates ranging
between 5.55% and 8.50% and have maturities ranging between 2011 and 2026.  An adjustment of $6.3 million was recorded to
increase the assumed loans to fair value.

·

In February and March 2006, we issued $150.0
million of 5.50% senior unsecured notes due in 2016. A portion of the proceeds
were used to retire our $100.0 million of 6.72% unsecured notes.  The remaining cash proceeds were used to fund
costs associated with the issuance of the debt and to repay amounts outstanding
under our line of credit.

·

In August 2006, we issued $450.0 million of 5.95%
senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and $250.0 million of 5.625% senior
unsecured notes due in 2011.  The
proceeds from these issuances were used to pay off the $700.0 million secured
term loan that was obtained to finance the purchase of the Mark Winkler Portfolio.

·

In November 2006, we issued $319.0 million of
5.91% debt due in 2016 secured by certain of our in-service real estate
properties.

·

In November 2006, we issued $575.0 million of
3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Exchangeable Notes”), which will pay interest
semiannually at a rate of 3.75% per annum and mature in December 2011.

The Exchangeable Notes can be exchanged for
shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events as well as at
any time beginning on August 1, 2011 and ending on the second business day
prior to the maturity date.  The
Exchangeable Notes will have an initial exchange rate of approximately 20.4298
common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, representing an
exchange price of approximately $48.95 per share of Duke’s common stock and an
initial exchange premium of approximately 20.0% based on the price of $40.79
per share of our common stock on the date of the original issuance. The initial
exchange rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances including
increases in our rate of dividends. Upon exchange the holders of the notes
would receive (i) cash equal to the principal amount of the note and (ii) to
the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note,
either cash or shares of common stock at our option.

Concurrent with the issuance of the Exchangeable
Notes, we purchased a capped call option on our common stock in a private
transaction.  This capped call option
allows us to buy our common shares, up to a maximum of approximately 11.7
million shares, from counter parties equal to the amounts of common stock
and/or cash related to the excess conversion value we would pay to the holders
of the Exchangeable Notes upon conversion. 
The capped call option will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity
date of the related Exchangeable Notes or the first day all of the related
Exchangeable Notes are no longer outstanding due to conversion or
otherwise.  The capped call option, which
cost $27.0 million, was recorded as a reduction of shareholders’ equity and
effectively increased the conversion price to 40% above the stock price on the
issuance date.  The fair value of the
capped call option was $27.9 million at December 31, 2006.

Segment Reporting

We are engaged in three reportable operating
segments, the first two of which consist of the ownership and rental of office
and industrial real estate investments. The third segment consists of our
build-to-suit for sale operations and providing various real estate services
such as property management, maintenance, leasing, development and construction
management to third-party property owners and joint ventures (“Service
Operations”). Our reportable segments offer different products or services and
are managed separately because each segment requires different operating
strategies and management expertise.

The assets of the Service Operations business
segment generally include properties under development.  During the period between the completion of
development, rehabilitation or repositioning of a Service Operations property
and the date the property is contributed to a property fund or sold to a third
party, the property and its associated rental income and rental expenses are
included in the applicable property operations segment because the primary
activity associated with the Service Operations property during that period is
rental activities.  Upon contribution or
sale, the resulting gain or loss is part of the income of the Service
Operations business segment.

Non-segment revenue consists mainly of equity in
earnings of unconsolidated companies and other insignificant rental operations
such as retail properties. Segment FFO information (FFO is defined below) is
calculated by subtracting operating expenses attributable to the applicable
segment from segment revenues. Non-segment assets consist of corporate assets
including cash, deferred financing costs and investments in unconsolidated
companies. Interest expense and other non-property specific revenues and
expenses are not allocated to individual segments in determining our performance
measure.

We assess and measure segment operating results
based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Funds From Operations
(“FFO”), which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating
performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental
operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
like Duke. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted
by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT created FFO as
a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical
cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance
with GAAP.  FFO is a non-GAAP financial
measure developed by NAREIT to compare the operating performance of REITs.  The most comparable GAAP measure is net
income (loss).  FFO should not be
considered as a substitute for net income or any other measures derived in
accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets
in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets
diminishes predictably over time.  Since
real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market
conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation
of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost
accounting to be insufficient by themselves. 
FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding
extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of
previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus certain non-cash
items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after
similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of FFO, combined
with the required primary GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of
operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of
REIT operating results more meaningful. 
Management considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative
operating and financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in
conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance)
because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated
operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and
amortization, FFO provides a useful comparison of the operating performance of
our real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.

The following table shows (i) the revenues and FFO
for each of the reportable segments and (ii) a reconciliation of net income
available for common shareholders to the calculation of FFO for the years ended

Shareholders’ Equity

We periodically access the public equity markets
to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental properties or to
pay down debt. The proceeds of these offerings are contributed to DRLP in
exchange for an additional interest in DRLP. 
In January 2006, we issued $184.0 million of 6.95% Series M Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares, from which a portion of the net proceeds were used
to redeem our $75.0 million of outstanding 8.45% Series I Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Shares.  Offering costs of $2.6
million were charged against net income available to common shareholders in
conjunction with the redemption of the Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Shares.  In June 2006, we issued $110.0

in whole or in part).

Pursuant to the $750 million share repurchase
plan that was approved by our board of directors, we paid approximately $91.9
million and $297.1 million for the redemption of 2,266,684 and 8,995,775 of our
common shares at an average price of $40.55 and $33.02 per share during the
years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. From time to time,
management may repurchase additional common shares pursuant to our share
repurchase plan.

(12)

Stock Based Compensation

We are authorized to issue up to 10,462,147
shares of our common stock under our stock based employee and non-employee
compensation plans.

Some of our stock-based compensation awards,
including both stock options and restricted stock units, have a retirement
eligible provision, whereby awards granted to an employee who has reached
certain age and service criteria, automatically vest upon such employee’s
retirement. We have previously accounted for this type of arrangement by
recognizing compensation cost (for both pro forma and expense recognition
purposes) over the full stated vesting period of the award and, if the employee
retired before the end of the vesting period, recognizing any remaining
unrecognized compensation cost at the date of retirement. Upon adoption of SFAS
123(R), expense on new awards is recognized over a period up until when the
awards are no longer contingent upon future service.  Had we applied this method of vesting to all
existing unvested awards issued to retirement eligible employees prior to
January 1, 2006, we would have recognized an additional $1.0 million in stock-based
employee compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

An additional requirement of SFAS 123(R) is that
estimated forfeitures be considered in determining compensation expense. As
previously permitted, we recorded forfeitures when they occurred. The effect of
this accounting change on existing nonvested stock compensation was
insignificant.

The effect of adopting SFAS 123(R) was not
significant to earnings or cash flows.

Cash flows resulting from tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation cost from the exercise of stock options
(excess tax benefits) were not significant in any period presented.

Fixed Stock Option Plans

We had options outstanding under six fixed stock
option plans as of December 31, 2006. Additional grants may be made under one
of those plans. Stock option awards granted under our stock based employee and
non-employee compensation plans generally vest over five years at 20% per year
and have contractual lives of ten years. 
The exercise price for stock option grants is set at the fair value of
our common stock on the day of grant.

2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, had a weighted average fair value per
option of $3.60, $3.04, and $2.84. As of December 31, 2006, there was $3.4
million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options
granted under the plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average remaining period of 2.97 years. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively,
was $11.3 million, $3.4 million, and $8.5 million.  Compensation expense recognized for fixed
stock option plans was $1.7 million, $1.1 million, and $853,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.  The fair value of options vested during the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $1.6 million, $1.2 million,
and $1.1 million, respectively.

The fair values of the options were determined
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The risk free interest rate assumption is based
upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock
options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history of and our
present expectation of future dividend payouts. Our computation of expected
volatility for the valuation of stock options granted in the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 is based on historic volatility over a period
of time equal to the expected term. The expected life of employee stock options
represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain
outstanding.

Performance Share Plan

Performance shares were granted under the 2000
Performance Share Plan, with each performance share economically equivalent to
one share of our common stock.

The performance shares vest over a five-year
period with the vesting percentage for a year dependent upon our attainment of
certain predefined levels of earnings growth for such year.  The performance shares have a contractual
life of five years.

In April 2006, the 2000 Performance Share Plan
was amended to provide that awards would be settled in shares of common stock
rather than cash.  The fair value of
existing awards was fixed at the date of the amendment and the fair value of
subsequent awards will be fixed at the fair value of our common stock at the
date of grant.

The following table summarizes transactions for
our performance shares for the year ended December 31, 2006:

during the year ended December 31, 2006 was $918,000.

Shareholder Value Plan Awards

Our 2005 Shareholder Value Plan (“2005 SVP Plan”),
a sub-plan of our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, was approved by our
shareholders in April 2005. Upon vesting, payout of the 2005 Shareholder Value
Plan awards will be made in shares of our common stock. Under the 2005 SVP
Plan, shareholder value awards fully vest three years after the date of grant.
The number of common shares to be issued may range from 0%-300% of the target
shares awarded and will be based upon our total shareholder return for such
three-year period as compared to the S&P 500 Index and the NAREIT Real Estate
50 Index. Each index is weighted at 50%.

Awards made under the 2005 SVP Plan are measured
at fair value, which is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model that
was developed to accommodate the unique features of the 2005 SVP Plan.
Compensation cost recognized under the 2005 SVP Plan was $879,000 and $438,000
for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

of three years.

Restricted
Stock Units

Under our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and our
2005 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan approved by our shareholders in
April 2005, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) may be granted to non-employee
directors, executive officers and selected management employees. An RSU is
economically equivalent to one share of our common stock. RSUs granted prior to
January 1, 2006 vest 20% per year over five years, have contractual lives of
five years and are payable in shares of our common stock.  RSUs granted to existing non-employee
directors subsequent to January 1, 2006 vest 100% over one year, and have
contractual lives of one year. We recognize the value of the granted RSUs over
this vesting period as expense.

under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 4 years.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as
changes in interest rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to
interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from
time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

In August 2005, we entered into $300.0 million of
cash flow hedges through forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge interest
rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2007. The swaps
qualify for hedge accounting, with any changes in fair value recorded in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). At December 31, 2006, the fair
value of these swaps was approximately $9.9 million in an asset position as the
effective rates of the swaps were lower than current interest rates at December
31, 2006.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

In March 2005, we entered into $300.0 million of
cash flow hedges through forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge interest
rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2006. The swaps
qualified for hedge accounting, with any changes in fair value recorded in
OCI.  In March 2006, we issued $150.0
million of 5.5% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and terminated a corresponding
amount of the cash flow hedges designated for this transaction. The settlement
amount paid of approximately $800,000 will be recognized to earnings through
interest expense ratably over the life of the senior unsecured notes and the
ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant.  In August 2006, we issued $450.0 million of 5.95%
senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $250.0 million of 5.63% senior unsecured
notes due 2011 and terminated the remaining $150 million of cash flow
hedges.  The settlement amount received
of approximately $1.6 million will be recognized to earnings through a
reduction of interest expense ratably over the lives of the senior unsecured
notes. The ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant.

In June 2004, we simultaneously entered into
three forward-starting interest rate swaps aggregating $144.3 million, which
effectively fixed the rate on financing expected in 2004 at 5.346%, plus our
credit spread over the swap rate. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting;
therefore, changes in the fair value were recorded in OCI. In August 2004, we
settled these three swaps when we issued $250.0 million of senior unsecured
notes with an effective interest rate of 6.33%, due in 2014. We paid $6.9
million to unwind the swaps, which is amortized from OCI into interest expense
over the life of the new 6.33% senior unsecured notes.

The effectiveness of our hedges will be evaluated
throughout their lives using the hypothetical derivative method under which the
change in fair value of the actual swap designated as the hedging instrument is
compared to the change in fair value of a hypothetical swap.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No.
48,

Accounting

for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB

Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”).  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return.  The Interpretation
also provides guidance on description, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  FIN 48 becomes effective on January 1, 2007
and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our 2007 financial
position, results of operations, or liquidity.

In September 2006, the Securities Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”). SAB
108 provides guidance regarding the process of quantifying the materiality of
financial statement misstatements. We adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of
2006 with no effect to our financial statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have guaranteed the repayment of $79.6 million
of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection
with certain commercial developments. We will be required to make payments
under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified
developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does
not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any
significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

We also have guaranteed the repayment of secured
and unsecured loans of four of our unconsolidated subsidiaries. At December 31,
2006, the outstanding balance on these loans was approximately $129.0 million.
Management believes that the value of the real estate exceeds the loan balance
and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees.

We have entered into agreements, subject to the
completion of due diligence requirements, resolution of certain contingencies
and completion of customary closing conditions, for the future acquisition of
land totaling $36.1 million.

In October 2000, we sold or contributed
industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair value of $487 million to
a joint venture (Dugan Realty LLC) in which we have a 50% interest and
recognized a net gain of $35.2 million. In connection with this transaction,
the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to a $50 million
interest in the joint venture to us in exchange for our common stock or cash
(at our option), subject to certain timing and other restrictions. As a result
of this put option, we deferred $10.2 million of gain on sale of depreciated
property and recorded a $50 million liability.

We renewed all of our major insurance policies in
2006. These policies include coverage for acts of terrorism for our properties.
We believe that this insurance provides adequate coverage against normal
insurance risks and that any loss experienced would not have a significant
impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and
claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the amount of
any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect
our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
