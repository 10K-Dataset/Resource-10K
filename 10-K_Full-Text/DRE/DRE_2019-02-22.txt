EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report (the "Report") combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2018

of both Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "Duke Realty Corporation" or the "General Partner" mean Duke Realty Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries; and references to the "Partnership" mean Duke Realty Limited Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to the General Partner and the Partnership, collectively, and those entities owned or controlled by the General Partner and/or the Partnership.

Duke Realty Corporation is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") and is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning

99.2%

of the common partnership interests of the Partnership ("General Partner Units") as of

December 31, 2018

. The remaining

0.8%

of the common partnership interests ("Limited Partner Units" and, together with the General Partner Units, the "Common Units") are owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Partnership, the General Partner has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Partnership.

The General Partner and the Partnership are operated as one enterprise. The management of the General Partner consists of the same members as the management of the Partnership. As the sole general partner with control of the Partnership, the General Partner consolidates the Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same.

We believe combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of the General Partner and the Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits:

•

enhances investors' understanding of the General Partner and the Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;

•

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation of information since a substantial portion of the Company's disclosure applies to both the General Partner and the Partnership; and

•

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

We believe it is important to understand the few differences between the General Partner and the Partnership in the context of how we operate as an interrelated consolidated company. The General Partner's only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests in the Partnership. As a result, the General Partner does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Partnership and issuing public equity from time to time. The General Partner does not issue any indebtedness, but does guarantee some of the unsecured debt of the Partnership. The Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the business, directly or indirectly, and holds the ownership interests related to certain of the Company's investments. The Partnership conducts the operations of the business and has no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the General Partner, which are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for General Partner Units or Preferred Units, the Partnership generates the capital required by the business through its operations, its incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of Limited Partner Units to third parties.

Noncontrolling interests, shareholders' equity and partners' capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the General Partner and those of the Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the Partnership's financial statements include the interests in consolidated investees not wholly owned by the Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the General Partner's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Partnership level, as well as the common limited partnership interests in the Partnership, which are accounted for as partners' capital by the Partnership.

In order to highlight the differences between the General Partner and the Partnership, there are separate sections in this report, as applicable, that separately discuss the General Partner and the Partnership, including separate financial statements and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure of the General Partner and the Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the collective Company.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT

Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Report on Form 10-K for the General Partner and the Partnership, including, without limitation, those related to our future operations, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words "believe," "estimate," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "strategy," "continue," "plan," "seek," "could," "may" and similar expressions or statements regarding future periods are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements may contain such words.

These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from any predictions of future results, performance or achievements that we express or imply in this Report or in the information incorporated by reference into this Report. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may affect future results include, among others:

•

Changes in general economic and business conditions, including the financial condition of our tenants and the value of our real estate assets;

•

The General Partner's continued qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

•

Heightened competition for tenants and potential decreases in property occupancy;

•

Potential changes in the financial markets and interest rates;

•

Volatility in the General Partner's stock price and trading volume;

•

Our continuing ability to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all;

•

Our ability to successfully identify, acquire, develop and/or manage properties on terms that are favorable to us;

•

Potential increases in real estate construction costs;

•

Our ability to successfully dispose of properties on terms that are favorable to us, including, without limitation, through one or more transactions that are consistent with our previously disclosed strategic plans;

•

Inherent risks related to disruption of information technology networks and related systems, cyber security attacks and new system implementation;

•

Other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in our other reports and other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Although we presently believe that the plans, expectations and anticipated results expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Report are reasonable, all forward-looking statements are inherently subjective, uncertain and subject to change, as they involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including those beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict the nature, or assess the potential impact, of each new factor on our business. Given these uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements for events or circumstances that arise after the statement is made, except as otherwise may be required by law.

-


-

The above list of risks and uncertainties is only a summary of some of the most important factors and is not intended to be exhaustive. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included under the caption "Risk Factors" in this Report, and is updated by us from time to time in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings that we make with the SEC.

PART I

Item 1.  Business

Background

The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of bulk distribution ("industrial") real estate.

The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of an initial public offering in February 1986.

The Partnership was formed in October 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning

99.2%

of the Common Units at

December 31, 2018

. The remaining

0.8%

of the Common Units are owned by limited partners. Limited partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement"), the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner.

At

December 31, 2018

, our diversified portfolio of


rental properties encompassed

153.7 million

rentable square feet (including


unconsolidated joint venture in-service properties with

11.1 million

square feet,


consolidated properties under development with

7.6 million

square feet and

five

unconsolidated joint venture properties under development with

1.9 million

square feet). Our properties are leased by a diverse base of more than 1,000 tenants whose businesses include e-commerce, government services, manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, and distribution. We also owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), 1,650 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,000 acres through purchase options.

Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. We additionally have regional offices or significant operations in 19 other geographic or metropolitan areas including Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; Washington D.C./Baltimore, Maryland; Central Florida; New Jersey; Northern and Southern California; Pennsylvania and South Florida. We had approximately 400 employees at

December 31, 2018

.

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information related to our operational, asset and capital strategies.

Competitive Conditions

As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which we believe, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage as a real estate operator and in future development activities.

-


-

We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or on local levels. As a result, we intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market share, to the extent it is in markets or product types that align with our asset strategy (see Item 7), and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on our many strong relationships with customers that operate on a national level. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our tenants not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.

All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply of and demand for similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator.

Corporate Governance

Since our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer operationally, but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. The General Partner's system of governance reinforces this commitment and, as a limited partnership that has one general partner owning over 90% of the Partnership's common interest, the governance of the Partnership is necessarily linked to the corporate governance of the General Partner. Summarized below are the highlights of the General Partner's Corporate Governance initiatives.

-


-

The General Partner's Code of Conduct (which applies to all Directors and employees of the General Partner, including the Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers) and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are available in the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of the General Partner's website at www.dukerealty.com. A copy of these documents may also be obtained without charge by writing to Duke Realty Corporation, 600 East 96th Street, Suite 100, Indianapolis, Indiana 46240, Attention: Investor Relations.  If we amend our Code of Conduct as it applies to the Directors and all Executive Officers of the General Partner or grant a waiver from any provision of the Code of Conduct to any such person, we may, rather than filing a current report on Form 8-K, disclose such amendment or waiver in the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of the General Partner's website at www.dukerealty.com.

Additional Information

For additional information regarding our investments and operations, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Available Information

In addition to this Report, we file quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. All documents that are filed with the SEC are available free of charge on the General Partner's corporate website, which is www.dukerealty.com. We are not incorporating the information on the General Partner's website into this Report, and the General Partner's website and the information appearing on the General Partner's website is not included in, and is not part of, this Report. You may also access any document filed through the SEC's home page on the Internet (http://www.sec.gov). In addition, since the General Partner's common stock is listed on the NYSE, you may read the General Partner's SEC filings at the offices of the NYSE, 11 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this Report, you should carefully consider, in consultation with your legal, financial and other professional advisors, the risks described below, as well as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption "Risk Factors" in evaluating us and our business before making a decision regarding an investment in the General Partner's securities.

The risks contained in this Report are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem to be immaterial, also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. The trading price of the General Partner's securities could decline due to the materialization of any of these risks, and its shareholders and/or the Partnership's unitholders may lose all or part of their investment.

This Report also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section in this Report entitled "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.

Risks Related to Our Business

Our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the long-term risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness, or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to refinance borrowings by our unconsolidated subsidiaries on favorable terms or at all. If our debt cannot be paid, refinanced or extended, we may not be able to make distributions to shareholders and unitholders at expected levels. Further, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher interest rates or other restrictive financial covenants upon the refinancing, then such refinancing would adversely affect our cash flow and funds available for operation, development and distribution.

We also have incurred, and may incur in the future, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Thus, if market interest rates increase, so will our interest expense, which could reduce our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and unitholders at expected levels.

Debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our shareholders and unitholders.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common equity and, at times, preferred equity issued by the General Partner. Debt financing may not be available over a longer period of time in sufficient amounts, on favorable terms or at all. If the General Partner issues additional equity securities, instead of debt, to manage capital needs, the interests of our existing shareholders and unitholders could be diluted.

-


-

Financial and other covenants under existing credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.

The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As a result, we would also likely be unable to borrow any further amounts under our other debt instruments and other debt obligations may be accelerated, which could adversely affect our ability to fund operations.

Downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs or reduce our access to funding sources in the credit and capital markets.

We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, consisting mostly of unsecured debt. We are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor's Ratings Group based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. All of our debt ratings remain investment grade, but there can be no assurance that we will not be downgraded or that any of our ratings will remain investment grade. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.

Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

If we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity, then we may be unable to pursue future development projects and other strategic initiatives.

To complete our ongoing and planned development projects, and to pursue our other strategic initiatives, we must continue to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to fund those activities. To generate that capital and liquidity, we rely upon funds from our existing operations, as well as funds that we raise through our capital raising activities. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our long-term needs, or if we are unable to generate capital and liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, then we may not be able to pursue development projects, acquisitions, or our other long-term strategic initiatives.

The General Partner's stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to its shareholders and to the Partnership's unitholders, if and when they convert their Limited Partner Units to shares of the General Partner's common stock.

The market price of the General Partner's common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in the General Partner's common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the General Partner's share price, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the General Partner's common stock, include uncertainty in the markets, general market and economic conditions, as well as those factors described in these "Risk Factors" and in other reports that we file with the SEC.

Many of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of the General Partner's common stock. If the market price of the General Partner's common stock declines, then its shareholders and the Partnership's unitholders, respectively, may be unable to resell their shares and units upon terms that are attractive to them. We cannot assure that the market price of the General Partner's common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the securities markets in general may experience considerable unexpected price and volume fluctuations.

-


-

Our use of joint ventures may negatively impact our jointly-owned investments.

We have, and may continue to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:

•

We could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property;

•

Our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties;

•

Our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues; and

•

Maturities of debt encumbering our jointly owned investments may not be able to be refinanced at all or on terms that are as favorable as the current terms.

Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks.

Our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as computer viruses, computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware or other malicious codes, phishing, employee error or malfeasance, or other unauthorized access. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. Any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.

We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents.  However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable when considering the rapid pace of change in this area.  There can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems will be effective, or that we will be able to maintain our systems free from security breaches, system compromises, misuses of data, or other operational interruptions. Accordingly, we may be unable to prevent major security breaches or entirely mitigate the risk of other system interruptions or failures.

We could also be negatively impacted by similar disruptions to the operations of our vendors or outsourced service providers.

Our ability to report timely and accurate information could be negatively impacted by our plan to implement a new accounting and enterprise resource planning system.

We are in the process of implementing a new accounting and enterprise resource planning system.  A system implementation of this magnitude entails a significant degree of inherent risk.  The key elements of this implementation include the conversion of data from our existing system to the new system and the design of the new system to process and report financial and other transactions in an accurate and complete manner.  If these, or other aspects of the implementation are not executed successfully, then our ability to report timely and accurate information could be negatively impacted.  Failure to report required information in a timely or accurate fashion could result in financial penalties, fines and the loss of our well-known-seasoned issuer status with the SEC and our ability to utilize the abbreviated registration statement on Form S-3.  Such events could have a significant adverse effect on the value of the General Partner’s securities and our ability to raise capital through equity offerings.

-


-

Additionally, the process of implementing a new system includes the inherent risk of incurring significant additional costs should the time and resource requirements of the implementation be greater than what we currently anticipate.

Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders and unitholders could decrease as a result of factors related to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate, many of which are outside of our control.

Our business is subject to the risks incident to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate, many of which involve circumstances not within our control. Such risks include the following:

•

Changes in the general economic climate;

•

The availability of capital on favorable terms, or at all;

•

Increases in interest rates;

•

Local conditions such as oversupply of property or a reduction in demand;

•

Competition for tenants;

•

Changes in market rental rates;

•

Delay or inability to collect rent from tenants who are bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise unwilling or unable to pay;

•

Difficulty in leasing or re-leasing space quickly or on favorable terms;

•

Costs associated with periodically renovating, repairing and reletting rental space;

•

Our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance on our properties;

•

Our ability to control variable operating costs;

•

Changes in government regulations; and

•

Potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, tax and other laws.

Any one or more of these factors could result in a reduction in our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders and unitholders.

Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from properties decreases.

Our financial results depend on leasing space in our real estate to tenants on terms favorable to us. Our income and funds available for distribution to our shareholders and unitholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot meet their lease obligations to us or we are unable to lease properties on favorable terms. In addition, if a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and we may incur substantial legal costs. Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance costs and our debt service payments, generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment. As a result, we may have a reduction in our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders and unitholders.

Our real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to development.

We continue to selectively develop new properties for rental operations in our existing markets when accretive returns are present. These development activities generally require various government and other approvals, which we may not receive. In addition, we also are subject to the following risks associated with development activities:

•

Unsuccessful development opportunities could result in direct expenses to us;

-


-

•

Construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated, or possibly unprofitable;

•

Time required to complete the construction of a project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity;

•

Occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable; and

•

Favorable sources to fund our development activities may not be available.

We may be unsuccessful in operating completed real estate projects.

We face the risk that the real estate projects we develop or acquire will not perform in accordance with our expectations. This risk exists because of factors such as the following:

•

Prices paid for acquired facilities are based upon a series of market judgments; and

•

Costs of any improvements required to bring an acquired facility up to standards to establish the market position intended for that facility might exceed budgeted costs.

As a result, we may develop or acquire projects that are not profitable.

We are exposed to the risks of defaults by tenants.

Any of our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken their financial condition. In the event of default or the insolvency of a significant number of our tenants, we may experience a substantial loss of rental revenue and/or delays in collecting rent and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection, a court could allow the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants became unable to meet their obligations to us, became insolvent or declared bankruptcy.

We may be unable to renew leases or relet space.

When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if our tenants do renew or we are able to relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of renovations, if necessary) may be less favorable than current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space, or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than current rates, then our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected, especially if we were unable to lease a significant amount of the space vacated by tenants in our properties.

Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our facilities, including property, liability and environmental coverage. We believe this coverage is of the type and amount customarily obtained for real property. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current replacement cost of the damaged assets. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, acts of a governmental authority and other factors also may make it unfeasible to collect insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or destroyed. If an uninsured or underinsured loss occurred, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property, and we would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. We are also subject to the risk that our insurance providers may be unwilling or unable to pay our claims when made.

Our acquisition and disposition activity may lead to long-term dilution.

Our asset strategy is to increase our investment concentration in the industrial real estate product type and further diversify our geographic presence.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our strategy or that our execution of such strategy will lead to improved results.

Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.

From time to time, we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:

•

liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

•

claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;

•

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

We could be exposed to significant environmental liabilities as a result of conditions of which we currently are not aware.

As an owner and operator of real property, we may be liable under various federal, state and local laws for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. In addition, we could have greater difficulty in selling real estate on which hazardous substances were present or in obtaining borrowings using such real estate as collateral. It is our general policy to have Phase I environmental audits performed for all of our properties and land by qualified environmental consultants at the time of purchase. These Phase I environmental audits have not revealed any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on our business. However, a Phase I environmental audit does not involve invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, and we cannot be sure that the Phase I environmental audits did not fail to reveal a significant environmental liability or that a prior owner did not create a material environmental condition on our properties or land which has not yet been discovered. We could also incur environmental liability as a result of future uses or conditions of such real estate or changes in applicable environmental laws.

We are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate-change related risks.

We are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. We may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

If the General Partner were to cease to qualify as a REIT, it would lose significant tax benefits.

The General Partner intends to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Qualification as a REIT provides significant tax advantages to the General Partner. However, in order for the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT, it must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. Satisfaction of these requirements also depends on various factual circumstances not entirely within our control. The fact that the General Partner holds its assets through the Partnership further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the

-


-

General Partner's REIT status. Although we believe that the General Partner can continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot offer any assurance that it will continue to do so or that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the qualification requirements or the federal income tax consequences of qualification. If the General Partner were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would have the following effects:

•

The General Partner would not be allowed a deduction for dividends distributed to shareholders and would be subject to federal corporate income tax (and any applicable state and local income taxes) on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates;

•

Unless the General Partner was entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, it would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a REIT;

•

The General Partner's net earnings available for investment or distribution to its shareholders would decrease due to the additional tax liability for the year or years involved; and

•

The General Partner would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders in order to qualify as a REIT.

As such, the General Partner's failure to qualify as a REIT would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of the General Partner's securities and, consequently, the Partnership's Units.

REIT distribution requirements limit the amount of cash we have available for other business purposes, including amounts that we need to fund our future capital needs.

To maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, the General Partner must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. The General Partner intends to continue to make distributions to its shareholders to comply with the 90% distribution requirement. However, this requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital for use for other business purposes. If we do not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements of the General Partner, we may have to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements. If the General Partner fails to satisfy the distribution requirement, it would cease to qualify as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and investments in REITs may change in a manner that could adversely affect us or shareholders.

Legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect, and may adversely affect us and/or shareholders.

We are subject to certain provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, which may reduce the likelihood of the General Partner's shareholders receiving a control premium for their shares.

Indiana anti-takeover legislation and certain provisions in our governing documents, as we discuss below, may discourage potential acquirers from pursuing a change-of-control transaction with us. As a result, the General Partner's shareholders may be less likely to receive a control premium for their shares.

Ownership Restriction.

Subject to certain exceptions, the General Partner's charter provides that no person or entity may beneficially own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (in value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the General Partner's outstanding common stock or 9.8% in value of its outstanding stock.

Unissued Preferred Stock.

The General Partner's charter permits its board of directors to classify unissued preferred stock by setting the rights and preferences of the shares at the time of issuance. This power enables the General Partner's board to adopt a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill. Although the General Partner has repealed its previously existing poison pill and its current board of directors has adopted a policy not to adopt a

-


-

shareholder rights plan without shareholder approval, the General Partner's board can change this policy at any time. The adoption of a poison pill would discourage a potential bidder from acquiring a significant position in the General Partner without the approval of its board.

Business-Combination Provisions of Indiana Law.

The General Partner has not opted out of the business-combination provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law. As a result, potential bidders may have to negotiate with the General Partner's board of directors before acquiring 10% of its stock. Without securing board approval of the proposed business combination before crossing the 10% ownership threshold, a bidder would not be permitted to complete a business combination for five years after becoming a 10% shareholder. Even after the five-year period, a business combination with the significant shareholder would either be required to meet certain per share price minimums as set forth in the Indiana Business Corporation Law or to receive the approval of a majority of the disinterested shareholders.

Control-Share-Acquisition Provisions of Indiana Law.

The General Partner has not opted out of the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law regarding acquisitions of control shares. Therefore, those who acquire a significant block (at least 20%) of the General Partner's shares may only vote a portion of their shares unless its other shareholders vote to accord full voting rights to the acquiring person. Moreover, if the other shareholders vote to give full voting rights with respect to the control shares and the acquiring person has acquired a majority of the General Partner's outstanding shares, the other shareholders would be entitled to special dissenters' rights.

Supermajority Voting Provisions.

The General Partner's charter prohibits business combinations or significant disposition transactions with a holder of 10% of its shares unless:

•

The holders of 80% of the General Partner's outstanding shares of capital stock approve the transaction;

•

The transaction has been approved by three-fourths of those directors who served on the General Partner's board before the shareholder became a 10% owner; or

•

The significant shareholder complies with the "fair price" provisions of the General Partner's charter.

Among the transactions with large shareholders requiring the supermajority shareholder approval are dispositions of assets with a value greater than or equal to $1,000,000 and business combinations.

Operating Partnership Provisions.

The limited partnership agreement of the Partnership contains provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, including a requirement that holders of at least 90% of the outstanding Common Units approve:

•

Any voluntary sale, exchange, merger, consolidation or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership in one or more transactions other than a disposition occurring upon a financing or refinancing of the Partnership;

•

The General Partner's merger, consolidation or other business combination with another entity unless after the transaction substantially all of the assets of the surviving entity are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for Common Units;

•

The General Partner's assignment of its interests in the Partnership other than to one of its wholly owned subsidiaries; and

•

Any reclassification or recapitalization or change of outstanding shares of the General Partner's common stock other than certain changes in par value, stock splits, stock dividends or combinations.

We are dependent on key personnel.

The General Partner's executive officers and other senior officers have a significant role in the success of our Company. Our ability to retain our management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave our Company is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for each of the years in the five-year period ended

December 31, 2018

. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" included in this Form 10-K (in thousands, except per share or per Common Unit data):

(1) Funds from operations ("FFO") is a non-GAAP measure used in the real estate industry and is calculated in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). In addition to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, we assess and measure the overall operating results of the General Partner and the Partnership based upon NAREIT FFO, which is a non-GAAP industry performance measure that management believes is a useful indicator of consolidated operating performance.  NAREIT FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT.

-


-

The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders. NAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Management believes that the use of NAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders, combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that the use of NAREIT FFO as a performance measure enables investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT's activity and assist them in comparing these operating results between periods or between different companies.

In December 2018, NAREIT issued the "NAREIT Funds from Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement" (the "2018 White Paper"), which reaffirmed, and in some cases refined, NAREIT’s prior determinations concerning FFO.  The guidance in the 2018 White Paper allows preparers an option as it pertains to whether gains or losses on sale, or impairment charges, on real estate assets incidental to a REIT’s business are excluded from the calculation of FFO.  We have made the election to exclude activity related to such real estate assets that are incidental to our business.  Under the guidance in the 2018 White Paper, NAREIT FFO is calculated as net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses on sales of real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business) and related taxes, gains and losses from change in control, impairment charges related to real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business) and similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  The guidance in the 2018 White Paper is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  We early-adopted the guidance in the 2018 White Paper effective December 31, 2018 and have, accordingly, revised prior periods to reflect that guidance.

NAREIT FFO for 2017, as previously reported, was revised pursuant to the 2018 White Paper, which resulted in a decrease of $8.7 million and $8.8 million for the General Partner and the Partnership, respectively, due to excluding gains on land sales and land impairment charges.  NAREIT FFO for 2016, as previously reported, was also revised, which resulted in a decrease of $12.1 million and $12.2 million for the General Partner and the Partnership, respectively, due to excluding gains on land sales, gains on incidental property sales, land impairment charges and a gain on change in control.  The revision to NAREIT FFO for 2015 resulted in an increase of $6.5 million and $6.6 million to the amounts previously reported for the General Partner and the Partnership, respectively, due to excluding land impairment charges and gains on land sales.  The revision to NAREIT FFO for 2014 resulted in an increase of $23.0 million and $23.3 million to the amounts previously reported for the General Partner and the Partnership, respectively, due to excluding land impairment charges and gains on land sales.  NAREIT-defined reconciling items between net income and NAREIT FFO totaled

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of industrial real estate.

The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations in 1986 and is the sole general partner of the Partnership.  The Partnership is a limited partnership formed in 1993, at which time all of the properties and related assets and liabilities of the General Partner, as well as proceeds from a secondary offering of the General Partner's common shares, were contributed to the Partnership.  Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. We operate the General Partner and the Partnership as one enterprise, and therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to the General Partner and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Partnership, collectively.

At

December 31, 2018

, we:

•

Owned or jointly controlled


primarily industrial properties, of which


properties with

144.1 million

square feet were in service and


properties with

9.5 million

square feet were under development.  The


in-service properties were comprised of


consolidated properties with

133.0 million

square feet and


unconsolidated joint venture properties with

11.1 million

square feet.  The


properties under development consisted of


consolidated properties with

7.6 million

square feet and

five

unconsolidated joint venture properties with

1.9 million

square feet.

•

Owned directly, or through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), approximately 1,650 acres of land and controlled approximately 1,000 acres through purchase options.

-


-

Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential.

Operational Strategy

Our operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations as well as NAREIT FFO through (i) maintaining property occupancy and increasing rental rates, while also keeping lease-related capital costs contained, by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing new build-to-suit, substantially pre-leased and, in select markets, speculative development projects; and (iii) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.

Asset Strategy

Our strategic objectives include (i) increasing our investment in quality industrial properties through development; (ii) acquiring properties in markets we believe provide the best potential for future rental growth; and (iii) maintaining an optimal land inventory through selected strategic land acquisitions, new development activity and sales of surplus land. We are continuing to execute our asset strategy through a disciplined approach by identifying development opportunities, identifying select acquisition targets where the asset quality and pricing meet our objectives and continually evaluating our portfolio for disposition by regularly identifying assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives.

Capital Strategy

Our capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure in coordination with the execution of our overall operational and asset strategies. We are focused on maintaining our current investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2018, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Services and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, and we are focused on maintaining such ratings in order to maintain access to liquidity.

In support of our capital strategy, we employ an asset disposition program to sell non-strategic real estate assets, which generate proceeds that can be recycled into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives or otherwise manage our capital structure.

We continue to focus on maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than 20%; and (iii) issuing common equity as needed to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic developments or acquisitions. With our successes to date and continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we expect to be in a very strong position to be opportunistic in our investment opportunities.

Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy

We are focused on promoting our growth in a sustainable way, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for our stakeholders.  As part of our vision to continually set the standard for maximizing stakeholder value, we have a long standing commitment to sustainable practices in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives.  Our environmental initiatives have included research, development and deployment of sustainable building strategies and technologies, staff education and LEED accreditation to construct high-performing sustainable buildings and to operate an energy-efficient portfolio. While we do not control most of the utility usage at our properties, we partnered with Goby, Inc. starting in 2018 in order to help monitor and manage the utility usage that we do control.  In 2018, we also became a member of Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark, a leading provider of real estate sustainability performance assessments.

We are committed to fair compensation, fostering a dynamic and balanced work environment and providing employees with developmental opportunities to perform well and derive satisfaction from their work.  We also focus on charitable giving and volunteering, with a dollars for doers program (matching dollars for volunteer hours spent) and our matching gifts program (matching dollars for employee donation) as well as paid community service

-


-

days for all employees.  We maintain a formal and structured diversity and inclusion program and have increased diversity within our board of directors with a Board that is now 21% female.  Through all of these initiatives, we endeavor to make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business.

We strive to maintain an effective corporate governance structure and comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies. Please see “Item 1-Corporate Governance’ for more information regarding our governance initiatives.

Through all of our environmental, social and governance efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and community, while also benefiting ours investors, employees, tenants and the communities in which we operate.

Year in Review

Overall, the economy has performed consistently with economic forecasts, with estimated growth in the United States gross domestic product of 2.9% for 2018. The 10-year Treasury rate generally fluctuated between 2.7% and 3.0% for most of 2018 and ended the year at 2.7%.  The continued growth of e-commerce and supply chain modernization has been a significant positive factor for the industrial real estate sector, while the issues facing some traditional retail operators have not significantly impacted our business. Under these conditions we were able to execute our asset and capital strategies for the year and had a successful 2018.

strategic and operational activities are as follows:

•

We generated

$511.4 million

of total net cash proceeds from the disposition of


consolidated buildings and 187 acres of wholly owned undeveloped land.

•

We started new development projects with expected total costs of $862.1 million, which included $104.4 million of expected total costs for five development projects started within unconsolidated joint ventures. The development projects started in


were, in aggregate, 57.5% pre-leased.

We placed 18 newly completed wholly owned development projects in service, which totaled 9.5 million square feet with total costs of $640.4 million.  These properties were 73.9% leased at December 31,


.

•

The total estimated cost of our consolidated properties under construction at December 31,

, with

$43.9 million

of costs already incurred. The consolidated properties under construction are

53%

pre-leased, while the unconsolidated joint venture properties under construction are

66%

pre-leased.

•

Same property net operating income, on a cash basis, as defined hereafter under "Supplemental Performance Measures",

increased

by

4.3%

for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2018

, as compared to the same period in


.

•

As the result of leasing up space in speculative developments in service at the end of 2017, the percentage of total square feet leased for our in-service portfolio of consolidated properties

increased

from

96.1%

at December 31,


to

96.4%

at December 31,


.

•

Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties totaled

24.1 million

square feet in


compared to

21.4 million

square feet in


.  The

increase

in total leasing activity in


was largely the result of leasing new development projects as well as a higher volume of lease renewals.

•

Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties in


included

11.3 million

square feet of lease renewals, which represented an

81.7%

retention rate on a square foot basis.  New second generation and renewal leases, on a combined basis, executed for consolidated properties during the year resulted in a

24.2%

increase to net effective rents ("net effective rents" is defined hereafter in the "Key Performance Indicators" section) when compared to the previous leases of the same space.

We utilized the capital generated from dispositions during the year to reduce debt and to fund our development activities.  Highlights of our key financing activities are as follows:

•

In September 2018, we issued

$450.0 million

of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of

4.00%

, have an effective interest of

4.13%

, and mature on September 15, 2028.

•

During 2018, we repaid

three

fixed rate secured loans, totaling

$227.1 million

, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of

7.62%

.

•

During 2018, we issued 990,400 shares of common stock pursuant to our at the market ("ATM") equity program at an average price of $29.24 per share, generating gross proceeds of $29.0 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of $28.4 million.

Supplemental Performance Measures

In addition to NAREIT FFO we use (i) Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ("PNOI") and (ii) Same Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ("SPNOI") as supplemental non-GAAP performance measures.  Management believes that the use of PNOI and SPNOI combined with net income (which remains the primary

-


-

measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.  The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI and SPNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes.

PNOI and SPNOI each exclude expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP.  Furthermore, these metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis

PNOI is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items. As a performance metric that consists of only the cash-based revenues and expenses directly related to ongoing real estate rental operations, PNOI is narrower in scope than NAREIT FFO.

PNOI, as we calculate it, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled, but differently calculated, measures for other REITs. We believe that PNOI is another useful supplemental performance measure, as it is an input in many REIT valuation models and it provides a means by which to evaluate the performance of the properties within our Rental Operations segments. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations (our residual non-industrial properties that have not yet been sold, referred to throughout as "Non-Reportable"), are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations."

The major factors influencing PNOI are occupancy levels, acquisitions and sales, development properties that achieve stabilized operations, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses.

Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report shows a calculation of our PNOI for the years ended December 31,


,


and


and provides a reconciliation of PNOI for our Rental Operations segments to income from continuing operations before income taxes.

Same Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis

We also evaluate the performance of our properties, including our share of properties we jointly control, on a "same property" basis, using a metric referred to as SPNOI.  We view SPNOI as a useful supplemental performance measure because it improves comparability between periods by eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our portfolio.

On an individual property basis, SPNOI is computed in a consistent manner as PNOI.

Effective January 1, 2018, we define our "same property" population once a year at the beginning of the current calendar year and include buildings that were stabilized (the term "stabilized" means properties that have reached 90% leased or that have been in-service for at least one year since development completion or acquisition) as of January 1 of the prior calendar year. The "same property" pool is also adjusted to remove properties that were sold subsequent to the beginning of the current calendar year. As such, the "same property" population for the period ended December 31, 2018 includes all properties that we owned or jointly controlled at January 1, 2018, which had both been owned or jointly controlled and had reached stabilization by January 1, 2017, and have not been sold.

A reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes to SPNOI is presented as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

-


-

The composition of the line items titled "Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI" and "Non-Segment Items" from the table above are shown in greater detail in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.

We believe the factors that impact SPNOI are generally the same as those that impact PNOI.  The following table details the number of properties, square feet, average occupancy and cash rental rates for the properties included in SPNOI for the respective periods:

Key Performance Indicators

Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our Rental Operations. The following discussion highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider critical drivers of future revenues.

Occupancy Analysis

Our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue. The following table sets forth percent leased and average net effective rent information regarding our in-service portfolio of consolidated rental properties, including properties classified within both continuing and discontinued operations, at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively:

-


-

The

increase

in occupancy at

December 31, 2018

within our industrial portfolio, when compared to

December 31, 2017

, primarily resulted from the lease up of speculative developments that were placed in service, or acquired from third parties, during 2018.

Vacancy Activity

The following table sets forth vacancy activity, shown in square feet, from our in-service consolidated rental properties included within both continuing and discontinued operations, for the year ended

December 31, 2018

(in thousands):

Total Leasing Activity

The initial leasing of development projects or vacant space in acquired properties is referred to as first generation lease activity. Our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates and net effective rents primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re-lease expiring space. The leasing of such space that we have previously held under lease to a tenant is referred to as second generation lease activity. Second generation lease activity may be in the form of renewals of existing leases or new second generation leases of previously leased space. The total leasing activity for our consolidated and unconsolidated rental properties included within both continuing and discontinued operations, expressed in square feet of leases signed, is as follows for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


(in thousands):

Lease Expirations

The table below reflects our consolidated in-service portfolio lease expiration schedule, at

December 31, 2018

(in thousands, except percentage data and number of leases):

-

Building Acquisitions

Our decision process in determining whether or not to acquire a property or portfolio of properties involves several factors, including expected rent growth, multiple yield metrics, property locations and expected demographic growth in each location, current occupancy of the properties, tenant profile and remaining terms of the in-place leases in the properties. We pursue both brokered and non-brokered acquisitions, and it is difficult to predict which markets may present acquisition opportunities that align with our strategy. Because of the numerous factors considered in our acquisition decisions, we do not establish specific target yields for future acquisitions.

We acquired

nine

buildings during the year ended

December 31, 2018

and


buildings during the year ended

December 31, 2017

, one of which was sold as part of the disposition of nearly all of our medical office properties (the "Medical Office Portfolio Disposition"). The following table summarizes the acquisition price, percent leased at time of acquisition and in-place yields, by product type, for these acquisitions (in thousands, except percentage data):

-


-

Building Dispositions

We regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans.

We sold


consolidated buildings during the year ended

December 31, 2018

and


consolidated buildings, including 85 properties sold as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, during the year ended

December 31, 2017

. The following table summarizes the sales prices, in-place yields and percent leased, by product type, of these buildings (in thousands, except percentage data):

Development

Another source of our earnings growth is our consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture development activities. We expect to generate future earnings from Rental Operations as the development properties are placed in service and leased.

We had

9.5 million

square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of

$814.1 million

at December 31,


compared to 9.2 million square feet of properties under development with total estimated costs upon completion of $741.7 million at December 31,

to Year Ended December 31,


Rental and Related Revenue

The following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

-


-

The primary reasons for the

increase

in rental and related revenue from continuing operations were:

•

The acquisition of 36 properties and placing of 41 developments in service from January 1,


to

December 31, 2018

provided combined incremental revenues of $106.4 million in the year ended

December 31, 2018

when compared to


.

•

Increased occupancy and rental rates within our "same property" portfolio also contributed to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations. Average commencement occupancy and rental rates in our "same property" portfolio both increased, as compared to 2017.

•

Expense reimbursements increased primarily due to increased real estate taxes in our existing properties, as compared to 2017.

•

The above items contributing to the

increase

to rental and related revenue from continuing operations were partially offset by the sale of 28 in-service properties since January 1,


, which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, and resulted in a $35.7 million decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended

December 31, 2018

when compared to


.

Rental and related revenue from discontinued operations for the year ended

December 31, 2018

decreased compared to


as the result of the properties classified within discontinued operations being sold throughout 2017.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

Overall, rental expenses from continuing operations

increased

by

$8.5 million

in


compared to


.  The increase to rental expenses was primarily the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

-


-

Real estate tax expense from continuing operations

increased

by

$16.3 million

in


compared to


.  The increase to real estate taxes was mainly the result of acquisitions and developments placed in services from January 1,


to

December 31, 2018

and an increase in real estate taxes on our existing base of properties.  These increases to real estate tax expense were partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

The decreases in both rental expenses and real estate tax expense from discontinued operations were a result of the properties classified within discontinued operations being sold throughout 2017.

Service Operations

The following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively (in thousands):

Service Operations primarily consist of the leasing, property management, asset management, development, construction management and general contractor services for unconsolidated joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. Service Operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy, while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners and joint venture partners.

Net earnings from service operations increased as the result of a higher volume of third party construction projects during 2018.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations

increased

from

$273.6 million

in


to

$312.2 million

in


, primarily as the result of properties acquired and the developments placed in service from January 1,


to

December 31, 2018

.  The impact of acquired properties and developments placed in service was partially offset by property dispositions that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that generally own and operate rental properties.  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures

decreased

from

$63.3 million

in


to

$21.4 million

in


.

In


, we recorded equity in earnings of $12.1 million related to our share of the gain on sale of six unconsolidated joint venture buildings, as well as the gain on sale of our ownership interest in one unconsolidated joint venture and equity in earnings of $3.9 million representing our share of gains on involuntary conversion from insurance recoveries related to storm damage in one unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by a $2.2 million  impairment charge for one unconsolidated joint venture.

In


, we recorded $53.9 million to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures as the result of the gains on sale of our ownership interests in four unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as our share of the gain on the sale of one property from an unconsolidated joint venture.  These transactions included $47.5 million in gains from the sale of our ownership interests in two joint ventures in connection with the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition.

-


-

Promote Income

We recognized

$20.0 million

of promote income from the sale of our interest in one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, during the year ended

December 31, 2017

. We did not recognize any promote income during the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

Gain on Sale of Properties - Continuing Operations

We sold


properties during


that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of

$205.0 million

. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

We sold


properties during


that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of

$113.7 million

. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Gain on Sale of Land

Gain on sale of land

increased

from

$9.2 million

in


to

$10.3 million

in


.  We sold 187 acres of undeveloped land in


compared to 166 acres of undeveloped land in


.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist of two components.  The first component includes general corporate expenses, and the second component represents the indirect operating costs not allocated to, or absorbed by, either the development, leasing and operation of our wholly owned properties or our Service Operations.  Such indirect operating costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation, including related costs such as benefits and wage-related taxes, but also include other ancillary costs such as travel and information technology support.  Total indirect operating costs, prior to any allocation or absorption, and general corporate expenses are collectively referred to as our overall pool of overhead costs.

Those indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses.  We regularly review our total overhead cost structure relative to our leasing, development and construction volume and adjust the level of total overhead, generally through changes in our level of staffing in various functional departments, as necessary, in order to control overall general and administrative expense.

General and administrative expenses

increased

from

$54.9 million

in


to

$56.2 million

in


.  The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from


to


(in millions):

(1)  We capitalized

$19.0 million

and

$29.8 million

of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during


, compared to capitalizing

$19.1 million

and

$31.5 million

of such costs, respectively, for


.  Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled

35.1%

and

36.2%

of our overall pool of overhead costs for


and


, respectively.

Interest Expense

Interest expense allocable to continuing operations

decreased

from

$87.0 million

in


to

$85.0 million

in


, largely as the result of higher capitalization of interest due to an overall increase in development activities.  We capitalized

$27.2 million

of interest costs during


compared to

$18.9 million

during


. No interest expense was classified within discontinued operations in 2018.

During 2017,

$14.7 million

of interest expense was classified within discontinued operations.

-


-

Debt Extinguishment

During 2018, we repaid three secured loans, totaling

$227.1 million

, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of

7.62%

. We also repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt, which had a stated interest rate of 6.26%. We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of

$388,000

from these transactions including a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

During 2017, we repaid our

$250.0 million

variable rate term loan, which had a scheduled maturity date of January 2019 and bore interest at

LIBOR

plus

1.00%

.  We also repaid

$285.6 million

of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of January 2018 and

$128.7 million

of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of March 2020.  We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $26.1 million from these transactions during the year ended 2017, which included prepayment premiums and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Discontinued Operations

The property-specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes, allocated interest expense and depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss on the disposition of the properties and related income tax expense.

The operations of


buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations for the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  These


buildings were all medical office properties.  As a result, we classified operating income before gain on sales and income taxes of

$108,000

,

$18.4 million

and

$15.8 million

in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively.

Of these properties,


properties were sold at various points during


as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition and no properties were sold during


and


.  The gains on disposal of properties classified in discontinued operations totaled

$3.8 million

,

$1.36 billion

and

$1.0 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, respectively, and are reported in discontinued operations.  The related income tax impact, totaling

$12.5 million

for the year ended December 31, 2017, is also reported in discontinued operations, which is further discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.  There were no properties classified as held-for-sale and included in discontinued operations at

December 31, 2018

.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31,


to Year Ended December 31,


Rental and Related Revenue

The following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

The primary reasons for the

increase

in rental and related revenue from continuing operations were:

•

The acquisition of 43 properties and placing of 38 developments in service from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017 provided combined incremental revenues of $66.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to 2016.

-


-

•

Rental and related revenue from continuing operations includes lease termination fees, which relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligation before the end of the contractual lease term. The overall increase in rental and related revenue from continuing operations included an increase of $9.3 million in termination fees during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to 2016.

•

Increases to average commencement occupancy and rental rates in our same-property portfolio.

•

The above items contributing to the

increase

to rental and related revenue from continuing operations were partially offset by the sale of 45 in-service properties since January 1, 2016, which did not meet the criteria for inclusion within discontinued operations, and resulted in a $36.0 million decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to 2016.

Rental and related revenue from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased compared to the same period in 2016 as the properties sold and classified within discontinued operations were not held for the entire year ended December 31, 2017, with a majority of the properties being sold in the first six months of 2017.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

Overall, rental expenses from continuing operations

decreased

by

$9.7 million

in 2017 compared to 2016.  The decrease to rental expenses was primarily the result of sales of office properties, which generally have higher operating expenses than do industrial properties, and which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.  The impact of these sales was partially offset by incremental expenses related to developments placed in service and acquisitions.

Real estate taxes from continuing operations

increased

by

$10.0 million

in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase to real estate taxes was primarily the result of increased real estate taxes for our existing base of properties, due to rate increases or re-assessments, as well as the impact of the properties acquired and developments placed in service from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, many of which are in jurisdictions with higher real estate taxes.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

The decreases in both rental expenses and real estate tax expense from discontinued operations are a result of the timing of the sales of properties classified within discontinued operations, with a majority of these properties being sold in the first six months of 2017.

-


-

Service Operations

The following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively (in thousands):

Net earnings from service operations decreased as the result of the completion of higher margin projects that were underway during 2016.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense

increased

from

$242.6 million

in 2016 to

$273.6 million

in 2017, as the result of the impact of properties acquired and developments placed in service from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The impact of acquired properties and developments placed in service was partially offset by property dispositions between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased from $47.4 million in 2016 to $63.3 million in 2017.

In 2017, we recorded $53.9 million to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures as the result of the gains on sale of our ownership interests in four unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as our share of the gain on the sale of one property from an unconsolidated joint venture.  These transactions included $47.5 million in gains from the sale of our ownership interests in two joint ventures in connection with the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition.

In 2016, we recorded $31.6 million to equity in earnings related to our share of the gains on sale of unconsolidated joint venture buildings and undeveloped land.

Gain on Dissolution of Unconsolidated Joint Venture

We recognized a $30.7 million gain related to the dissolution of an unconsolidated joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2016.  We did not experience any similar dissolutions during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Promote Income

We recognized $20.0 million of promote income from the sale of our interest in one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $26.3 million of promote income related to the dissolution of an unconsolidated joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Gain on Sale of Properties - Continuing Operations

We sold 17 properties during 2017 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $113.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations.

We sold 32 properties during 2016 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $162.1 million. These properties did not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations.

-


-

Gain on Sale of Land

Gain on sale of land decreased from $9.9 million in 2016 to $9.2 million in 2017.  We sold 166 acres of undeveloped land in 2017 compared to 448 acres of undeveloped land in 2016.

Impairment Charges

Impairment charges classified in continuing operations include the impairment of undeveloped land and buildings.  In 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $4.5 million compared to $18.0 million in 2016.

We recognized impairment charges of $3.6 million related to 12 acres of land during 2017, and impairment charges of $14.3 million related to 244 acres of land during 2016.

We also recognized impairment charges of $859,000 related to one building in 2017, and $3.7 million related to one building in 2016.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses decreased from $55.4 million in 2016 to $54.9 million in 2017.  The following table sets forth the factors that led to the decrease in general and administrative expenses from 2016 to 2017 (in millions):

(1)   Our total pool of overhead costs decreased between periods, largely due to lower salary and related costs, as the result of workforce reductions executed primarily in connection with the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition during 2017.

(2)  We capitalized

$19.1 million

and

$31.5 million

of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during 2017, compared to capitalizing

$24.0 million

and

$25.9 million

of such costs, respectively, for 2016. Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled

36.2%

and

33.5%

of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

(3) The decrease in allocation of costs to Rental Operations and Service Operations resulted primarily from a lower allocation of overhead costs to property management and maintenance expenses that resulted from the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition during 2017 and further shifting our focus to industrial properties, which are less management intensive.

Interest Expense

Interest expense allocable to continuing operations

decreased

from

$112.8 million

in 2016 to

$87.0 million

in 2017. The decrease to interest expense from continuing operations was primarily due to interest savings from repaying outstanding debt with the proceeds from the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, and refinancing higher rate senior unsecured notes, since December 31, 2016.

We capitalized $18.9 million of interest costs during 2017 compared to $16.1 million during 2016.

Debt Extinguishment

During 2017, we repaid our $250.0 million variable rate term loan, which had a scheduled maturity date of January 2019 and bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%.  We also repaid $285.6 million of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of January 2018 and $128.7 million of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of March 2020.  We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $26.1 million from these transactions during the year ended 2017, which included repayment premiums and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

In June and July 2016, we repaid $275.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes, with a scheduled maturity in February 2017. In October 2016, we also redeemed $129.5 million in unsecured notes, which had a scheduled

-


-

maturity in August of 2019.  These transactions resulted in losses on debt extinguishment totaling $33.9 million during 2016, which included repayment premiums and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Acquisition-Related Activity

The acquisition-related activity in our consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income during 2016 consisted of gains related to acquisitions of businesses where we had a pre-existing non-controlling ownership interest ("step acquisitions") as well as transaction costs for completed acquisitions, to the extent that the acquired properties met the definition of a business.

Effective January 1, 2017, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-01 ("ASU 2017-01"), which revised the definition of a business and resulted in fewer property acquisitions being accounted for as business combinations. No acquired properties have met the definition of a business since the adoption of ASU 2017-01 and, accordingly, we recognized no expense for transaction costs in acquisition-related activities for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Pursuant to the criteria applicable prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2017, properties that were acquired generally met the definition of a business. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Acquisition-Related Activity line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income included $7.3 million in gains on step acquisitions (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report), which were comprised of a gain of $6.0 million on the acquisition of 14 properties in the Washington D.C. area from an unconsolidated joint venture (the "Quantico Joint Venture"), as well as a gain of $1.7 million on the acquisition of a property from another unconsolidated joint venture.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience.  Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our Audit Committee and independent auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:

Cost Capitalization

: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We capitalize all such costs through the completion of the building shell. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.

We also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods, after construction of the building shell has been completed, if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.

In assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction, development and

-


-

leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.

To ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease. These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized.

Impairment of Real Estate Assets:

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset's undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.

To the extent applicable marketplace data is available, we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired.

Real estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

Acquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets:

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant.  This “as-if vacant” value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties.  The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, estimated market rents and the fair value of the underlying land.

The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases.

•

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired

-


-

leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

•

Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical lease up periods, related to space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition.  These estimates include (i) lost rent at market rates, (ii) fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and (iii) theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.

To the extent that we gain control of real estate properties that are accounted for as asset acquisitions, as opposed to business combinations, we accumulate the costs of pre-existing equity interest and the consideration paid for additional interest acquired and do not remeasure our pre-existing equity interest. Generally contingencies arising from an asset acquisition are only recognized when the contingency is paid or becomes payable.

To the extent that we gain control of a property acquired that meets the definition of a business, we account for the acquisition in accordance with the guidance for step acquisitions at their full fair value and record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our existing equity interest. Additionally, contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.

The Audit Committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months, including payments of dividends and distributions and the capital expenditures needed to maintain our current real estate assets, primarily through working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds received from real estate dispositions. We had

$30.0 million

of outstanding borrowings on the Partnership's $1.20 billion unsecured line of credit at

December 31, 2018

.

In addition to our existing sources of liquidity, we expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and other capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow, proceeds from property dispositions and accessing the public debt and equity markets.  At

December 31, 2018

, we also held $255.0 million of notes receivable from the various entities that purchased our medical office properties in 2017, as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, which are scheduled to mature at various points through January 2020.

Rental Operations

Cash flows from Rental Operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable source of cash flow to fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for items such as periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of, or a short time following, the actual revenue recognition.

We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and bankruptcies and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, any of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations.

Unsecured Debt and Equity Securities

Our unsecured line of credit at

December 31, 2018

is described as follows (in thousands):

The Partnership's unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of

$1.20 billion

, with an interest rate on borrowings of LIBOR plus

0.875%

(equal to 3.39% for outstanding borrowings at December 31,2018), and a maturity date of

January 2022

, with options to extend until January 30, 2023.  Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional

$800.0 million

, for a total of up to

$2.00 billion

.  This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At

December 31, 2018

, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

In 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC") proposed that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate ("SOFR") replace LIBOR. Also ARRC proposed that the transition to SOFR from LIBOR take place by the end of 2021. As the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement has provisions that allow for automatic transition to a new rate and the Partnership has no other material debt arrangements that are indexed to LIBOR, we believe that the transition will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

At

December 31, 2018

, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities (including guarantees of the Partnership's debt securities by the General Partner). Equity securities are offered and sold by the General Partner, and the net proceeds of such offerings are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units or Preferred Units. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes.

The General Partner has an ATM equity program that allows it to issue new common shares from time to time, with an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 million.  During


, the General Partner issued 990,400 common shares pursuant to its ATM equity program, generating gross proceeds of approximately $29.0 million, and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of $28.4 million. As of

December 31, 2018

, the ATM equity program still had $79.1 million worth of new common shares available to issue.

In September 2018, we issued $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 4.00%, have an effective interest of 4.13%, and mature on September 15, 2028.

The Partnership has issued debt securities pursuant to certain indentures and related supplemental indentures, which also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants, as well as applicable covenants under our unsecured line of credit, at

December 31, 2018

.

Sale of Real Estate Assets

We regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of non-strategic properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. Although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non-strategic properties, potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties.

-


-

Sales of land and depreciable properties provided

$511.4 million

in net proceeds in


, compared to

$2.52 billion

in


and

$538.9 million

in


. We also held $255.0 million of notes receivable from certain of the buyers involved in the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, which were comprised of $35.0 million of notes guaranteed by a buyer with an A+ rated health system and $220.0 million of first mortgages, which are scheduled to mature in various tranches with the last maturity date in January 2020.

Transactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Transactions with unconsolidated joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity.  From time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated joint ventures, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own.  Additionally, unconsolidated joint ventures will from time to time obtain debt financing or sell properties and will then distribute to us, and our joint venture partners, all or a portion of the proceeds from such transactions. During


, our share of sale and capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures totaled

$23.1 million

.

Uses of Liquidity

Our principal uses of liquidity include the following:

•

property investment;

•

leasing/capital costs;

•

dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;

•

long-term debt maturities;

•

opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt; and

•

other contractual obligations.

Property Investment

Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties, primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential. Pursuant to this strategy, we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon our market outlook, including general economic conditions, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, and our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity, including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties.

Leasing/Capital Costs

Tenant improvements and lease-related costs pertaining to our initial leasing of newly completed space, or vacant space in acquired properties, are referred to as first generation expenditures. Such first generation expenditures for tenant improvements are included within "development of real estate investments" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while such expenditures for lease-related costs are included within "other deferred leasing costs."

Cash expenditures related to the construction of a building's shell, as well as the associated site improvements, are also included within "development of real estate investments" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Tenant improvements and leasing costs to renew or re-let rental space that we previously leased to tenants are referred to as second generation expenditures.  Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant, but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties, are also second generation expenditures.  One of the principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments.

The following table summarizes our second generation capital expenditures by type of expenditure, as well as capital expenditures for the development of real estate investments and for other deferred leasing costs (in thousands):

-


-

We had consolidated properties under development with an expected cost of

$709.7 million

at

December 31, 2018

, compared to projects with an expected cost of $642.1 million and $713.1 million at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

The capital expenditures in the table above include the capitalization of internal overhead costs.  We capitalized

$19.0 million

,

$19.1 million

and

$24.0 million

of overhead costs related to leasing activities, including both first and second generation leases, during the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, respectively.  We capitalized

$29.8 million

,

$31.5 million

and

$25.9 million

of overhead costs related to development activities, including both development and tenant improvement projects on first and second generation space, during the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, respectively.  Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled

35.1%

,

36.2%

and

33.5%

of our overall pool of overhead costs at

December 31, 2018

,


and


, respectively. Further discussion of the capitalization of overhead costs can be found in the year-to-year comparisons of general and administrative expenses and Critical Accounting Policies sections of this Item 7.

In addition to the capitalization of overhead costs, the totals for development of real estate assets in the table above include the capitalization of

$27.2 million

,

$18.9 million

and

$16.1 million

of interest costs in the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, respectively.

Dividend and Distribution Requirements

The General Partner is required to meet the distribution requirements of the Code in order to maintain its REIT status. We paid regular dividends or distributions of

$0.815

, $0.77 and $0.73 per common share or Common Unit for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, respectively.  We also paid a special dividend of $0.85 per common share or Common Unit during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the significant taxable gains on asset sales completed in that year.

We expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings, to meet the requirements to maintain the General Partner's REIT status, and additional amounts as determined by the General Partner's board of directors. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the General Partner's board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as the General Partner's board of directors deems relevant.

Debt Maturities

Debt outstanding at

December 31, 2018

had a face value totaling

$2.68 billion

with a weighted average interest rate of

4.00%

and maturities at various dates through 2028. Of this total amount, we had

$2.58 billion

of unsecured debt,

$79.7 million

of secured debt and $30.0 million outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit at

December 31, 2018

.  Scheduled principal amortization, maturities and early repayments of such debt totaled

$239.1 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

The following table is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at

December 31, 2018

(in thousands, except percentage data):

-


-

The Partnership’s unsecured line of credit is reflected in the table above as maturing in January 2023, based on the ability to exercise the two six-month extension options from its stated maturity date of January 2022. We anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from our Rental Operations and property dispositions and by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions.

Repayments of Outstanding Debt

To the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy, we may purchase or redeem some of our outstanding unsecured notes prior to their stated maturities.

In September 2018, using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes, we repaid two secured loans, totaling $223.9 million, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of 7.63%.

Guarantee Obligations

We are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments.

Historical Cash Flows

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were

$25.5 million

,

$193.6 million

and

$57.0 million

at

December 31, 2018

,


, and


, respectively. The following table highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our Rental Operations and Service Operations activities.  The receipt of rental income from Rental Operations continues to be our primary source of operating cash flows. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased from 2017,

-


-

as the result of higher cash flows from rental operations and lower cash paid for interest, partially offset by a $20.0 million promote payment received in connection with the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition during 2017.

The decrease to cash flow provided by operating activities between 2016 and 2017 was due to lower cash flows from our Rental Operations as the result of owning fewer properties due to the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition. This reduction to operating cash flows from Rental Operations was partially offset by lower cash paid for interest, as the result of significant debt repayments or refinancing that took place throughout 2016 and 2017.

Investing Activities

Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:

•

Real estate development costs were

$577.4 million

,

$549.6 million

, and

$401.9 million

during


,


, and


, respectively.

•

We paid cash of

$592.4 million

,

$1.23 billion

and

$269.8 million

, for real estate and undeveloped land acquisitions during


,


and


, respectively.

•

Sales of land and property generated net proceeds of

$511.4 million

,

$2.52 billion

and

$538.9 million

during


,


and


, respectively.

•

During 2018, we received repayments of

$154.1 million

on notes receivable from property sales, compared to

$3.7 million

$204.4 million

in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

•

Second generation tenant improvements, leasing costs and building improvements totaled

$53.5 million

,

$52.6 million

and

$59.3 million

during


,


and


, respectively.

•

We receive capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, either as the result of selling our ownership interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures or from our share of the proceeds from property sales from unconsolidated joint ventures. In


, we received

$23.1 million

in capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, primarily related to sale of six properties within three of our unconsolidated joint ventures. We received

$125.0 million

in capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures during


, primarily related to selling our interests in two unconsolidated joint ventures in connection with the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, compared to

$126.1 million

during

•

We made capital contributions and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures in the amounts of

$5.9 million

,

$10.3 million

and

$57.9 million

during


,


and


, respectively.

Financing Activities

The following items highlight significant capital transactions:

•

During 2018, the General Partner issued

990,400

common shares pursuant to its ATM equity program for net proceeds of

$28.4 million

. During 2017, the General Partner did not issue any shares of common stock pursuant to its ATM equity program, compared to

8.4 million

shares of common stock for net proceeds of

$215.6 million

in


.

•

We issued

$450.0 million

, $300.0 million and $375.0 million of senior unsecured notes during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

•

During 2018, the Partnership repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt. In 2017, the Partnership paid cash of $689.6 million to execute the repayment of a $250.0 million variable rate term loan, which was prepayable without penalty, and the early redemption of $414.3 million of senior unsecured notes. During 2016, the Partnership repurchased or redeemed $404.5 million of unsecured notes, for cash payments totaling $437.6 million.

•

During 2018, the Partnership repaid

three

secured loans for

$227.1 million

compared to repayments of eight secured loans for $66.5 million in 2017 and seven secured loans for $346.7 million in 2016.

•

We increased net borrowings on the Partnership's unsecured line of credit by

$30.0 million

in


,

decreased

net borrowings by

$48.0 million

in


and

decreased

net borrowings by

•

We paid regular cash dividends or distributions of

$0.815

, $0.77 and $0.73 per common share or per Common Unit during the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, respectively.

•

We paid a special dividend of $0.85 per common share or Common Unit during the fourth quarter of 2017 in order to maintain our compliance with the requirements for maintaining the General Partner's status as a

-


-

REIT. This special dividend was triggered by significant taxable gains on asset sales completed in 2017. We did not pay special dividends in 2018 or 2016.

•

Changes in book cash overdrafts are classified as financing activities within our consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Book cash overdrafts were $14.3 million, $36.3 million and $13.4 million at

December 31, 2018

,


and


, respectively.

Impact of Changes in Credit Ratings on Our Liquidity

We are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group.  Our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service, upgraded in 2016 from Baa2.  In addition, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, upgraded in 2016 from BBB.

The ratings of our senior unsecured notes could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

We have equity interests in unconsolidated partnerships and limited liability companies that primarily own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. These unconsolidated joint ventures are primarily engaged in the operation and development of industrial real estate properties. These investments provide us with increased market share and tenant and property diversification. The equity method of accounting is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies.  As a result, the assets and liabilities of these entities are not included on our balance sheet.

Our investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures represented approximately

1%

and

2%

of our total assets at

December 31, 2018

and

December 31, 2017

, respectively.  We believe that these investments provide several benefits to us, including increased market share, tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects.

The following table presents summarized financial information for unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

-


-

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated joint ventures or financial partnerships that have been established solely for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual Obligations

At

December 31, 2018

, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the following table:

(1)

Our long-term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest.  Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at

December 31, 2018

.

(2)

Our unsecured line of credit has a contractual maturity date in

January 2022

, but is reflected as a 2023 obligation based on the ability to exercise the two six-month extension options, which we may exercise at our discretion. Interest payments for our unsecured line of credit were calculated using the most recent stated interest rate that was in effect.

(3)

Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at

December 31, 2018

.

(4)

Represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of owned development projects and third-party construction projects.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long-term borrowings. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including long-term debt and interest rate swaps. For long-term debt, the table presents the principal amounts (in thousands) of the expected annual maturities, weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period and fair values (in thousands). For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amount (in thousands), weighted average interest rates by expected

maturity date and fair value (in thousands).

The Partnership’s unsecured line of credit is reflected in the table above as maturing in January 2023, based on the ability to exercise the two six-month extension options from its stated maturity date of January 2022 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report).

As the above table incorporates only those exposures that existed at

December 31, 2018

, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, the ultimate impact of interest rate fluctuations will depend on future exposures that arise, our hedging strategies at that time, to the extent we are party to interest rate derivatives, and interest rates. Interest expense on our unsecured line of credit, to the extent we have outstanding borrowings, will be affected by fluctuations in the LIBOR indices or applicable replacement rates as well as changes in our credit rating. The interest rate at such point in the future as we may renew, extend or replace our unsecured line of credit will be heavily dependent upon the state of the credit environment.

At

December 31, 2018

, the face value of our unsecured debt was

$2.58 billion

and we estimated the fair value of that unsecured debt to be

$2.55 billion

.  At

December 31, 2017

, the face value of our unsecured debt was

$2.13 billion

and our estimate of the fair value of that debt was

$2.19 billion

.

During 2018, we entered into two forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $200.0 million of anticipated debt offering in 2019, and the fair value of these swaps was $4.7 million in a liability position at December 31, 2018.

Management's Report on Internal Control

We, as management of Duke Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "General Partner"), are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of

December 31, 2018

, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.

The independent registered public accounting firm of KPMG LLP, as auditors of the General Partner's consolidated financial statements, has also issued an audit report on the General Partner's internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

Duke Realty Corporation:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Realty Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of

December 31, 2018

and


, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2018

, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III - Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

December 31, 2018

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)

The Company

The General Partner was formed in 1985, and we believe that it qualifies as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. The Partnership was formed on October 4, 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972.

The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning approximately

99.2%

of the Common Units at

December 31, 2018

. The remaining

0.8%

of the Common Units are owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Partnership, the General Partner has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Partnership. The General Partner and the Partnership are operated as one enterprise. The management of the General Partner consists of the same members as the management of the Partnership. As the sole general partner with control of the Partnership, the General Partner consolidates the Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same.

Limited partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner.

During 2017, we substantially completed the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, (see Note 3) and exited from the medical office product segment. As of

December 31, 2018

, we owned and operated a portfolio primarily consisting of industrial properties and provided real estate services to third-party owners.

Substantially all of our Rental Operations (see Note 8) are conducted through the Partnership. We conduct our Service Operations (see Note 8) through Duke Realty Services, LLC, Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited Partnership ("DCLP"), which are consolidated entities that are 100% owned by a combination of the General Partner and the Partnership. DCLP is owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. The equity interests in these controlled subsidiaries not owned by us are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Investments in entities that we do not control, and variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which we are not the primary beneficiary (to the extent applicable), are not consolidated and are reflected as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of reporting.

In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2015-02,

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

("ASU 2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the existing variable interest entity guidance. We have adopted ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016, which has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As the result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02, which stipulates that limited partnerships (and similar entities) where the limited partners do not have substantive participating or kick-out rights are VIEs, we determined that the Partnership is a VIE. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, the General Partner consolidated the Partnership pursuant to the voting interest model. We concluded that, because it holds majority ownership and exercises control over every aspect of the Partnership's operations, the General Partner is the primary beneficiary of the Partnership and, as such, will continue to consolidate the Partnership.

The assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same, as the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the


consolidated financial statement presentation.

Real Estate Investments

Rental real property, including land, land improvements, buildings and tenant improvements, are included in real estate investments and are generally stated at cost. Construction in process and undeveloped land are included in real estate investments and are stated at cost. Real estate investments also include our equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development.

Depreciation

Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated lives not to exceed


and


years, respectively, for properties that we develop, and not to exceed


and


years, respectively, for acquired properties. Tenant improvement costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or term of the related lease.

Cost Capitalization

Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. Direct costs include all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals. We capitalize a portion of our indirect costs associated with our construction, development and leasing efforts. In assessing the amount of direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. We do not capitalize any costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In addition, we capitalize costs, including real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, that have been allocated to vacant space based on the square footage of the portion of the building not held available for immediate occupancy during the extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized.

We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods when significant activities have ceased, which does not exceed the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains

90%

occupancy.

Impairment

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct

-


-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. We utilize marketplace participant assumptions to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is required to be measured. The estimation of future cash flows, as well as the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach, are highly subjective measures in estimating fair value.

Real estate assets classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Once a property is designated as held-for-sale, no further depreciation expense is recorded.

Purchase Accounting

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,

Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business

. ASU 2017-01 provides revised guidance to determine when an acquisition meets the definition of a business or should be accounted for as an asset acquisition, likely resulting in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions as opposed to business combinations. Transaction costs are capitalized for asset acquisitions while they are expensed as incurred for business combinations. ASU 2017-01 requires that when substantially all of the fair value of an acquisition is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets it does not meet the definition of a business. ASU 2017-01 also revises the definition of a business to include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. ASU 2017-01 will be effective, on a prospective basis, for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.

We early adopted ASU 2017-01 prospectively as of January 1, 2017 as permitted under the standard, which has not had a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

As a result of adoption of ASU 2017-01, our acquisitions of properties are generally asset acquisitions as they no longer meet the definition of a business. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized.  To the extent that an acquired property meets the definition of a business, we expense acquisition related costs immediately as period costs.

To the extent that we gain control of real estate properties that are accounted for as asset acquisitions, as opposed to business combinations, we accumulate the costs of pre-existing equity interest and consideration paid for additional interest acquired and we do not remeasure our pre-existing equity interest. Generally contingencies arising from an asset acquisition are only recognized when the contingency is paid or becomes payable.

To the extent that we gain control of a property acquired that meets the definition of a business, we account for the acquisition in accordance with the guidance for step acquisitions at its full fair value and record a gain or loss, within acquisition-related activity in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our pre-existing equity interest. Contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.

We allocate the purchase price of asset acquisitions and acquired properties that meet the definition of a business to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. Capitalized acquisition costs are also included in the total cost basis of acquired properties that are asset acquisitions. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is

-


-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant. This “as-if vacant” value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties.  The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, estimated market rents and the fair value of the underlying land. The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases as well as, to the extent applicable,

acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value. There have been no customer relationship intangible assets related to any of our acquisitions to date.

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, of space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition, of lost rent at market rates, fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.

Adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, if any, should be recorded in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.

Joint Ventures

We have equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that primarily own and operate rental properties or hold land for development. We consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is considered a VIE and would require consolidation. We (i) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity investment at risk, (ii) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group and whether there are limited partners (or similar owning entities) that lack substantive participating or kick out rights, guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (iii) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this VIE determination.

To the extent that we own interests in a VIE and we (i) have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) have the obligation or rights to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, then we would be determined to be the primary beneficiary and would consolidate the VIE.  To the extent that we own interests in a VIE, then at each reporting period, we re-assess our conclusions as to which, if any, party within the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary. Consolidated joint ventures that are VIEs are not significant in any period presented in these consolidated financial statements.

To the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as VIEs, they are consolidated if we control them through majority ownership interests or if we are the managing entity (general partner or managing member) and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by our ability to unilaterally make significant operating decisions, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the non-managing entity and the inability of the non-managing entity to remove us from our role as the managing entity.  Consolidated joint ventures that are not VIEs are not significant in any period presented in these consolidated financial statements.

-


-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we exercise significant influence but do not have control. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. We recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner's interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary.  If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value.

There were no unconsolidated joint ventures, in which we have any recognized assets or liabilities or have retained any economic exposure to loss at

December 31, 2018

that met the criteria to be considered VIEs.

Cash Equivalents

Investments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Valuation of Receivables

We reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over


days. Additional reserves are recorded for more current amounts, as applicable, where we have determined collectability to be doubtful. Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant with long-term risk, regardless of the status of current rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

Deferred Costs

Deferred Financing Costs

Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are deferred and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related loan. The costs for issuing debt, other than lines of credit, are presented on a balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt's carrying value, while debt issuance costs related to the Partnership's unsecured line of credit are presented as assets in the consolidated balance sheets, as part of other escrow deposits and other assets.

Lease Related Costs and Acquired Lease-Related Intangible Assets

All direct and indirect costs, including estimated internal costs, associated with the leasing of real estate investments owned by us are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease. We include lease incentive costs, which are payments made on behalf of a tenant to sign a lease, in deferred leasing costs and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms as a reduction of rental revenues. We include as lease incentives amounts funded to construct tenant improvements owned by the tenant. Unamortized costs are charged to expense upon the early termination of the lease or upon early payment of the financing.

Acquired lease-related intangible assets consist of above market lease assets and the value allocable to in-place leases. Above market lease assets are amortized as a reduction to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. In-place lease intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and included within depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests relate to the minority ownership interests in the Partnership and interests in consolidated property partnerships that are not wholly owned by the General Partner or the Partnership. Noncontrolling interests are subsequently adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to noncontrolling holders and the noncontrolling holders' proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity. We report noncontrolling interests as a component of total equity.

When a Common Unit of the Partnership is redeemed (Note 1), the change in ownership is treated as an equity transaction by the General Partner and there is no effect on its earnings or net assets.

Revenue Recognition

On January 1, 2018, we concurrently adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

("ASC 606") and ASC 610-20,

Other Income: Gains and Losses from the De-recognition of Non-financial Assets

("ASC 610-20") using a modified retrospective ("cumulative effect") method of adoption. ASC 606 has superseded nearly all existing GAAP revenue recognition guidance, although its scope excludes lease contracts, which represent our primary source of revenue. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it satisfies performance obligations, by transferring promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for fulfilling those performance obligations.

There was no cumulative adjustment recognized to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 as the result of adopting ASC 606 and ASC 610-20.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Rental and Related Revenue

The timing of revenue recognition under an operating lease is determined based upon ownership of the tenant improvements. If we are the owner of the tenant improvements, revenue recognition commences after the improvements are completed and the tenant takes possession or control of the space. If we determine that the tenant allowances or improvements we are funding are lease incentives, then we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant. Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis.

We record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any material conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us.

General Contractor and Service Fee Revenue

B

eginning with the January 1, 2018 adoption date, general contractor and service fee revenues, as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, are accounted for within the scope of ASC 606. General contractor and service fee revenues are comprised primarily of construction and development related revenues earned from third parties while acting in capacity of a developer, as a general contractor or a construction manager. There are other ancillary streams of revenue included in general contractor and service fee revenues (see Note 8), such as management fees earned from unconsolidated joint ventures, which are not significant.

Our construction arrangements are typically structured with only one performance obligation, which generally represents an obligation either to construct a new building or to construct fixtures in an existing building, and these single performance obligations are satisfied over time as construction progresses. We recognize revenue as we satisfy such performance obligations using the percentage of completion method, which is an input method allowed under ASC 606. Using this method, profits are recorded based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under the contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. We believe the percentage of completion method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services as changes in job performance and estimated profitability, which result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined, have not historically been significant. We typically receive regular progress payments on the majority of our construction arrangements and such arrangements generally have an original duration of less than one year. As the result of the relatively short duration of our construction arrangements, we have elected to apply the optional disclosure exemptions, included in ASC 606, related to our remaining performance obligations for our in-process construction projects, for which any future variable consideration is not material. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.  To the extent that a fixed-price contract is estimated to result in a loss, the loss is recorded immediately.

Opening and closing balances of construction receivables are presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under billed and over billed receivables on construction contracts totaled

$29.1 million

and

$161,000

, respectively, at

December 31, 2018

and

$8.3 million

and

$276,000

, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

.  Over billed receivables are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We generally do not have any contract assets associated with our construction arrangements.

Management fees are based on a percentage of rental receipts of properties managed and are recognized as the rental receipts are collected. Maintenance fees are based upon established hourly rates and are recognized as the services are performed.

Property Sales

Only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations (for example, a disposal of a major geographic area or a major line of business) should be presented as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, without consideration of significant continuing involvement. The Medical Office Portfolio Disposition during 2017 has met the criteria under ASC 205-20 for all of the consolidated in-service properties within the portfolio to be classified within discontinued operations (see Note 6).

Beginning January 1, 2018, gains on sales of properties, including partial sales, of non-financial assets (and in-substance non-financial assets) to non-customer are recognized in accordance with ASC 610-20, while the sale of non-financial assets with customers are governed by ASC 606. The only difference in the treatment of sales to customers and non-customers is the presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (revenue and expense is reported when the sale is to a customer and net gain or loss is reported when the sale is to a non-customer). Based on the nature of our business, our property sales generally represent transactions with non-customers. In the typical course of our business, sales of non-financial assets represent only one performance obligation and are recognized when an enforceable contract is in place, collectability is ensured and control is transferred to the buyer.

Under ASC 610-20 we are required to recognize a full gain or loss in a partial sale of non-financial assets, to the extent control is not retained. Any noncontrolling interest retained by the seller would, accordingly, be measured at fair value. We have primarily disposed of property and land in all cash transactions with no contingencies and no future involvement in the operations, and therefore, the adoption of ASC 610-20 has not significantly impacted the recognition of property and land sales.

Net Income Per Common Share or Common Unit

Basic net income per common share or Common Unit is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders, less dividends or distributions on share-based awards expected to vest (referred to as "participating securities" and primarily composed of unvested restricted stock units), by the weighted average number of common shares or Common Units outstanding for the period.

Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the sum of net income attributable to common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in earnings allocable to Limited Partner Units (to the extent the Limited Partner Units are dilutive), less dividends or distributions on participating securities that are anti-dilutive, by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, to the extent they are dilutive, weighted average number of Limited Partner Units outstanding and any potential dilutive securities for the period. Diluted net income per Common Unit is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common unitholders, less dividends or distributions on participating securities that are anti-dilutive, by the sum of the weighted average number of Common Units outstanding and any potential dilutive securities for the period.

Federal Income Taxes

General Partner

The General Partner has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, as amended. To qualify as a REIT, the General Partner must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least

90%

of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders. Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to maintain the General Partner's REIT status. As a REIT, the General Partner is entitled to a tax deduction for the dividends it pays to shareholders. Accordingly, the General Partner generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as it currently distributes to shareholders an amount equal to or in excess of its taxable income. The General Partner is, however, generally subject to federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to its shareholders. If the General Partner fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.

REIT qualification reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of state and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a dividends paid deduction and are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.  As a REIT, the General Partner may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes if it engages in certain types of transactions.

Deferred Tax Assets

A valuation allowance is in place for substantially all of the deferred tax assets of the taxable REIT subsidiary for all periods presented.  Based primarily on the projections of taxable income pursuant to our current operating strategy, management believes that it is more likely than not that the taxable REIT subsidiary will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.  Income taxes are not material to our operating results or financial position.  Our taxable REIT subsidiary has no significant net deferred income tax positions or unrecognized tax benefit items.

Fair Value Measurements

We estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methodologies. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to which we have access.

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily consist of derivative financial instruments (see Note 13). We determine the fair value of derivative instruments using standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and termination cost at each balance sheet date. We recognize all derivatives at fair value within the line items Other Assets or Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect nonperformance risk for us and the respective counter-party in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we consider the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as mutual puts.

We have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Although the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, we assess the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.

In addition to the acquired properties discussed in Note 3, assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements consisted of real estate assets, both buildings and undeveloped land, which were determined to be impaired and recorded at fair value as discussed in Note 6. The table below aggregates the total fair value of these impaired assets as determined during the years ended

Derivative Financial Instruments

We periodically enter into certain interest rate protection agreements to effectively convert or cap floating rate debt to a fixed rate, and to hedge anticipated future financing transactions, both of which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12,

Targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities

("ASU 2017-12"). ASU 2017-12 eliminates the current requirement to separately recognize periodic hedge ineffectiveness and requires the entire effect of the hedging instrument and hedged item to be presented in the same income statement line item. ASU 2017-12 will be effective for public entities on January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective approach with early adoption permitted after the issuance. We have early adopted ASU 2017-12 effective October 1, 2018 and such adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

If a derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows.

Statement of Cash Flows

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flow

s ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows and how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one

class of cash flows. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2018, on a retrospective basis, and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Cloud Computing Arrangements

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software: Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement ("CCA") That is a Service Contract

("ASU 2018-15"). ASU 2018-15 requires entities that enter into hosted CCA service arrangements to apply the existing internal-use software guidance to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. Under that model, both internal and external costs incurred in developing, coding and testing the new system are capitalizable, while the costs incurred in training and certain data conversion are expensed. ASU 2018-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2019 prospectively to eligible costs after the date the guidance is first applied or retrospectively, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2018-15 early and have applied it since January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

Leases

("ASU 2016-02"), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). ASU 2016-02 supersedes existing leasing standards.

For lessors, the accounting under ASU 2016-02 will remain largely unchanged from current GAAP; however ASU 2016-02 requires that lessors expense certain initial direct costs, which are capitalizable under existing leasing standards, as incurred. Under the new standard, only the incremental costs of signing a lease will be capitalizable. If the new standard had been in effect, internal lease related costs totaling

$12.3 million

and

$13.9 million

, which are currently capitalizable, would have been expensed for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

ASU 2016-02 also specifies that payments for certain lease-related services, which are often included in lease agreements, represent "non-lease" components that will become subject to the guidance in ASC 606, when ASU 2016-02 becomes effective. However, on July 30, 2018 the FASB issued targeted amendments via ASU 2018-11, one of which provides lessors an optional election to not separate "non-lease" components from the related lease components when certain criteria are met and instead account for those components as a single component. We have concluded that we met the criteria to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a lease liability for all leases with an initial term of greater than 12 months regardless of classification. ASU 2016-02 will impact the accounting and disclosure requirements for ground leases, and other operating leases, where we are the lessee. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately


office and ground leases that will require us to measure and record a ROU asset and lease liability of approximately

$40.0 million

on January 1, 2019.  We are finalizing our discount rate analysis which is a key driver in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability. The ROU assets and lease liabilities are provisional and are still being evaluated by management. Such amounts are subject to change and will be finalized on our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

A set of practical expedients for implementation, which must be elected as a package and for all leases, may also be elected. These practical expedients include (i) relief from re-assessing whether an expired or existing contract meets the definition of a lease, (ii) relief from re-assessing the classification of expired or existing leases at the adoption date and (iii) allowing previously capitalized initial direct leasing costs to continue to be amortized.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ASU 2016-02 and any subsequent amendments will be effective for us on January 1, 2019.  The targeted amendments issued on July 30, 2018, also provide a transitional option that will permit lessors to use the effective date of ASU 2016-02 as the date of initial application, without restating comparative periods, and to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment as of the effective date.  We will apply the practical expedients as well as the optional relief provided by the targeted amendments.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

Acquisitions and dispositions for the periods presented were completed in accordance with our strategy to reposition our investment concentration among the markets in which we operate and to increase our overall investments in quality industrial projects. With the exception of certain properties that have subsequently been sold or classified as held-for-sale, the results of operations for all acquired properties have been included in continuing operations within our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized and transaction costs related to business combinations and dispositions are expensed.

2018 Acquisitions

We paid cash of

$348.1 million

for asset acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2018.

We acquired

nine

properties during the year ended December 31, 2018. We determined that these

nine

properties did not meet the definition of a business and, accordingly, we accounted for them as asset acquisitions as opposed to business combinations.

The following table summarizes amounts recognized for each major class of assets and liability (in thousands) for these acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2018:

The leases in the acquired properties had a weighted average remaining life at acquisition of approximately

11.3

years.

2017 Acquisitions

We paid cash of

$982.6 million

for acquisitions of


properties during the year ended December 31, 2017.  We determined that these


properties did not meet the revised definition of a business as the result of adopting ASU 2017-01 and, accordingly, they were treated as asset acquisitions as opposed to business combinations.

The following table summarizes amounts recognized for each major class of asset and liability (in thousands) for these acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017:

During 2017 we acquired a portfolio of real estate assets from Bridge Development Partners LLC (the "Bridge Portfolio") located in Northern New Jersey, Southern California and South Florida, for a total purchase price of

square feet, which were

68.9%

leased at the time of acquisition, as well as


acres of undeveloped land.

The leases in the acquired properties had a weighted average remaining life at acquisition of approximately

8.7 years

.

2016 Acquisitions

We paid cash of

$170.6 million

for acquisitions of


properties during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Quantico Joint Venture Properties

In the fourth quarter of 2016, pursuant to a pre-existing purchase option, we acquired


properties in the Washington D.C. area from the Quantico Joint Venture in which we had a pre-existing equity ownership interest.  These


properties were comprised of


industrial properties and

three

office properties. These


properties were previously encumbered by a

$131.3 million

CMBS loan and, pursuant to the terms of the purchase option, we repaid the loan as consideration for the acquisition of the underlying properties.

We recognized a gain on this step-acquisition equal to the excess of the fair value of our pre-existing equity ownership interest in the acquired assets over the carrying value of our investment in those assets pursuant to the criteria that were applicable prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017.  The carrying value of our investment was

zero

as the result of accumulated operating losses at the joint venture level.

The fair value of the


properties acquired was internally determined, primarily using an income approach, and based upon Level 3 inputs, as previously defined. The inputs used in determining the fair value of the acquired properties, as well as allocating that fair value to the individual components of the real estate assets acquired, are disclosed hereafter in the Fair Value Measurements section of this note. The following table summarizes the fair value of the amounts recognized for each major class of assets for this acquisition as well as the computation of the gain on acquisition (in thousands):

We had previously accounted for our interest in these


properties using the equity method. No goodwill or gain on bargain purchase was recognized in connection with this transaction. We sold

one

of the acquired properties, a

241,000

square foot office property, immediately following the acquisition for net proceeds of

$53.4 million

, which we also used as the determination of that property's fair value.

During 2017, we sold our remaining interest in the Quantico Joint Venture.

Distribution of Joint Venture Properties

Included in our property acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2016 was an industrial property that we received as part of a non-cash distribution of properties from Duke/Hulfish LLC ("Duke/Hulfish"), a former

20%

owned unconsolidated joint venture.  On June 30, 2016, as part of a plan of dissolution, Duke/Hulfish distributed its ownership in

seven

properties to our partner in the joint venture while distributing its ownership interest in

one

property to us.  We also received

$2.8 million

in cash from the joint venture in order to balance the value of the distributions received in accordance with the applicable ownership percentages.  As the result of this dissolution

-


-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

transaction, we recognized a gain equal to the excess of the fair value of the

one

property distributed to us, plus the cash that we received, over the carrying value of our

20%

investment in the

eight

properties that were distributed from Duke/Hulfish (both to us and our partner). The computation of this gain is shown as follows (in thousands):

In connection with the dissolution of Duke/Hulfish, and the sale of its final property to a third party in July 2016, we recognized promote income (additional incentive-based cash distributions from the joint venture, in excess of our

20%

ownership interest), totaling

$26.3 million

, during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Other 2016 Acquisitions

In addition to the properties acquired from the Quantico Joint Venture, we acquired

three

properties during the year ended December 31, 2016, which included the industrial property received as part of a non-cash distribution in connection with the dissolution of Duke/Hulfish. The following table summarizes the fair value of amounts recognized for each major class of asset (in thousands) for these acquisitions during 2016:

The leases in the acquired properties, including the Quantico Joint Venture properties, had a weighted average remaining life at acquisition of approximately

7.1 years

.

We included

$5.1 million

in rental revenues and

$1.1 million

in earnings from continuing operations during 2016 for properties acquired during 2016, including the Quantico Joint Venture properties, since their respective dates of acquisition.

Fair Value Measurements

We determine the fair value of the individual components of real estate asset acquisitions primarily through calculating the "as-if vacant" value of a building, using an income approach, which relies significantly upon internally determined assumptions. We have determined that these estimates primarily rely on Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions. The most significant assumptions used in calculating the "as-if vacant" value for acquisition activities during


and


, respectively, are as follows:

Capitalized acquisition costs were insignificant and the fair value of the

nine

properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2018 was substantially the same as the cost of acquisition.

Acquisition-Related Activity

The acquisition-related activity in our consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income consisted of the following, for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively (in thousands):

-


-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Acquisition-related activity during 2016 was primarily driven by the gain on the step acquisition of the


Quantico Joint Venture properties mentioned above, as well as the gain on the step acquisition of an additional property from another unconsolidated joint venture.

Effective January 1, 2017, we early adopted ASU 2017-01, which revised the definition of a business and resulted in fewer property acquisitions being accounted for as business combinations. We recognized no income or expense from acquisition-related activities for the years ended December 31,


and


.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, most properties that were acquired met the definition of a business and transaction costs were expensed as incurred. Gains or losses were recognized from step acquisitions.

Dispositions

Dispositions of buildings (see Note 6 for the number of buildings sold in each year, as well as for their classification between continuing and discontinued operations) and undeveloped land generated net cash proceeds of

$511.4 million

,

$2.52 billion

and

$538.9 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Significant 2017 Dispositions

Dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2017 included


consolidated properties sold as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition to a subsidiary of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. ("HTA"), as well as certain other buyers, for a total sales price of

$2.78 billion

and a gain on sale of

$1.39 billion

. The Medical Office Portfolio Disposition was executed in connection with our strategy to focus solely on the industrial real estate product type.

A portion of the sale price for the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition was financed through either unsecured notes, or first mortgage interests in a portion of the sold properties, that we provided to HTA and other buyers, totaling

$400.0 million

, which was reflected within notes receivable from property sales in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments mature at various points through January 2020 and all bear interest at

4.0%

. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we collected

$145.0 million

of principal on notes receivable from the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition. We concluded that the value, and the rate of interest, for these financial instruments would approximate fair value as computed using an income approach and that this determination of fair value was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.  We have reviewed the creditworthiness of the borrowers and have concluded it is probable that we will collect all amounts due according to their contractual terms.

In connection with the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, during the year ended December 31, 2017 we received

$105.3 million

for the sale of our interest in

two

unconsolidated joint ventures whose underlying assets were comprised of medical office properties, which was reflected within Capital Distributions from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  We recorded

$47.5 million

of income related to the sale of our interests in these unconsolidated joint ventures within equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  In connection with the sale of our interest in

one

of these unconsolidated joint ventures, we also recorded promote income (additional incentive-based cash distributions from the joint venture, in excess of our ownership interest) of

$20.0 million

from the sale of our interest, which was reflected as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and reflected within net cash provided by operating activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In connection with the sale, we recorded income tax expense totaling

$17.7 million

including

$12.5 million

classified within discontinued operations and

$5.2 million

classified within continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(2) Differences between the net investment in our unconsolidated joint ventures and our underlying equity in the net assets of the ventures are primarily a result of previous impairments related to our investment in the unconsolidated joint ventures, basis differences associated with the sales of properties to joint ventures in which we retained an ownership interest and loans we have made to the joint ventures. These adjustments have resulted in an aggregate difference reducing our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures by

$11.4 million

and

$6.4 million

Real Estate Assets, Discontinued Operations, Assets Held-for-Sale and Impairments

Real Estate Assets

Real estate assets, excluding assets held-for-sale, consisted of the following (in thousands):

Discontinued Operations

All of the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 and included in discontinued operations are medical office properties. Because of the size of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, and the fact that it represented our exit from the medical office product type, we determined that the disposition represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, the consolidated in-service properties in this portfolio met the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations. As the result of its classification within discontinued operations, operating results pertaining to the properties classified within discontinued operations were reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

The following table illustrates the number of sold or held-for-sale properties included in, or excluded from, discontinued operations:

-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Properties sold in 2017 but excluded from discontinued operations included

four

properties under development, which were disposed as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, as these properties did not meet the criteria to be included in discontinued operations.

For the properties that were classified in discontinued operations, we allocated interest expense to discontinued operations and have included such interest expense in computing income from discontinued operations. Interest expense allocable to discontinued operations includes interest on any secured debt for properties included in discontinued operations and an allocable share of our consolidated unsecured interest expense for unencumbered properties. The allocation of unsecured interest expense to discontinued operations was based upon the gross book value of the unencumbered real estate assets included in discontinued operations as it related to the total gross book value of our unencumbered real estate assets. There were no additional properties classified as discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 and, as such, no interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations during 2018.

The following table illustrates the operational results of the buildings reflected in discontinued operations for the years ended

The fair value of the land upon which we recognized impairment charges was estimated based on asset-specific offers to purchase, comparable transactions and, in certain cases, estimates made by national and local independent real estate brokers who were familiar with the land parcels subject to evaluation as well as with conditions in the specific markets where the various land parcels are located.  In all cases when estimates from brokers were utilized, members of our senior management who were responsible for the individual markets where the land parcels are located, and members of the Company’s accounting and financial management team, reviewed the broker’s estimates for factual accuracy and reasonableness.  In all cases, we were ultimately responsible for all valuation estimates made in determining the extent of the impairment. Our valuation estimates primarily relied upon Level 3 inputs.

Indebtedness at

December 31, 2018

and


consists of the following (in thousands):

Secured Debt

At

December 31, 2018

, our secured debt was collateralized by rental properties with a carrying value of

$220.1 million

and by a letter of credit in the amount of

$2.2 million

.

The fair value of our fixed rate secured debt at

December 31, 2018

was

$80.2 million

. Because our fixed rate secured debt is not actively traded in any marketplace, we utilized a discounted cash flow methodology to determine its fair value. Accordingly, we calculated fair value by applying an estimate of the current market rate to discount the debt's remaining contractual cash flows. Our estimate of a current market rate, which is the most significant input in the discounted cash flow calculation, is intended to replicate debt of similar maturity and loan-to-value relationship. The estimated market rates for all of our current fixed rate secured debt is

4.00%

, based on the attributes of the specific loans. The current market rates we utilized were internally estimated; therefore, we have concluded that our determination of fair value for our fixed rate secured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.

During 2018, we repaid

three

fixed rate secured loans, totaling

$227.1 million

, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of

7.62%

.

During 2017, we repaid

eight

loans, totaling

$66.5 million

, which had a weighted average stated rate of

5.85%

.

Unsecured Debt

At

December 31, 2018

, all of our unsecured debt bore interest at fixed rates and primarily consisted of unsecured notes that are publicly traded. We utilized broker estimates in estimating the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt. Our unsecured notes are thinly traded and, in certain cases, the broker estimates were not based upon comparable transactions. The broker estimates took into account any recent trades within the same series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, comparisons to recent trades of other series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, trades of fixed rate unsecured debt from companies with profiles similar to ours, as well as overall economic conditions. We reviewed these broker estimates for reasonableness and accuracy, considering whether the estimates were based upon market participant assumptions within the principal and most advantageous market and whether any other observable inputs would be more accurate indicators of fair value than the broker estimates. We concluded that the broker estimates were representative of fair value. We have determined that our estimation of the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.  The estimated trading values of our fixed rate unsecured debt, depending on the maturity and coupon rates, ranged from

95.00%

to

118.00%

of face value.

The indentures (and related supplemental indentures) governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations.

We were in compliance with all such financial covenants at

We took the following actions during


and


as it pertains to our unsecured indebtedness:

•

In September 2018, we issued

$450.0 million

of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of

4.00%

, have an effective interest of

4.13%

, and mature on September 15, 2028. A portion of these proceeds were used to repay two of the secured loans noted above, totaling

and a maturity date of March 10, 2019.

•

In June 2017, we repaid our

$250.0 million

variable rate term loan, which had a scheduled maturity date of January 2019 and bore interest at

LIBOR

plus

1.00%

, and recognized a loss of

$523,000

from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

•

In June 2017, we also repaid

$285.6 million

of senior unsecured notes that had a stated interest rate of

6.50%

and an effective interest rate of

6.08%

, with a scheduled maturity date of January 2018.  We recognized a loss of

$9.0 million

including a repayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

•

In July 2017, we repaid

$128.7 million

of senior unsecured notes that had both a stated and an effective interest rate of

6.75%

with a scheduled maturity date of March 2020.  We recognized a loss of

$16.6 million

including a repayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

•

In December 2017, we issued

$300.0 million

senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of

3.38%

, have an effective interest rate of

3.39%

and mature on December 15, 2027.

Unsecured Line of Credit

Our unsecured line of credit at

December 31, 2018

is described as follows (in thousands):

The Partnership's unsecured line of credit has an interest rate on borrowings of

LIBOR

plus

0.875%

(equal to

3.39%

for outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018) and a maturity date of

January 30, 2022

, with options to extend until January 30, 2023.  Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional

$800.0 million

, for a total of up to

$2.00 billion

.  This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At

December 31, 2018

,

we were in compliance with all financial covenants under this line of credit.

To the extent there are outstanding borrowings, we utilize a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value of outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit.

T

o the extent that credit spreads have changed since the origination of the line of credit, the net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate would represent the difference between the book value and the fair value. Our estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate, considering current market conditions and our specific credit profile, at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings. As our credit spreads have not changed appreciably, we believe that the contractual interest rate and the current market rate on the line of credit are the same. The current market rate is internally estimated and therefore is primarily based upon a Level 3 input.

Segment Reporting

Reportable Segments

During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we completed the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, which resulted in all of our in-service medical office properties being classified within discontinued operations, with the exception of a property that did not meet the criteria for classification as held-for-sale at

December 31, 2018

.   As a result of this transaction, beginning the second quarter of 2017, our medical office properties were no longer presented as a separate reportable segment, with substantially all such operating results being classified within discontinued operations.  The remaining medical office property included in continuing operations no longer meets the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation, and is classified as part of our Non-Reportable Rental Operations. Properties that are not included in our reportable segments, because they do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment, are generally referred to as Non-Reportable Rental Operations.  Our Non-Reportable Rental Operations primarily include our remaining office properties and medical office property at

December 31, 2018

.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

two

reportable operating segments, the first consisting of the ownership and rental of industrial real estate investments. Our ongoing investments in new real estate investments are determined

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

largely upon anticipated geographic trends in supply and demand for industrial buildings, as well as the real estate needs of our major tenants that operate on a national level.  Our strategic initiatives and our allocation of resources have been historically based upon allocation among product types, which was consistent with our designation of reportable segments, and after having sold nearly all of our office and medical office properties we intend to increase our investment in industrial properties and treat them as a single operating and reportable segment. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our Non-Reportable Rental Operations, are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations."

Our second reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development, general contracting and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively referred to as "Service Operations." The Service Operations segment is identified as one single operating segment because the lowest level of financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision maker are the results for the Service Operations segment in total

.

Further, our reportable segments are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary, a legal entity through which certain of the segment's aforementioned operations are conducted.

Revenues by Reportable Segment

The following table shows the revenues for each of the reportable segments, as well as a reconciliation to consolidated revenues, for the years ended

Supplemental Performance Measure

PNOI is the non-GAAP supplemental performance measure that we use to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources among, the real estate investments in the reportable and operating segments that comprise our Rental Operations.  PNOI for our Rental Operations segments is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items (collectively referred to as "Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI," as shown in the following table).  Additionally, we do not allocate interest expense, depreciation expense and certain other non-property specific revenues and expenses (collectively referred to as "Non-Segment Items," as shown in the following table) to our individual operating segments.

We evaluate the performance of our Service Operations reportable segment using net income or loss, as allocated to that segment ("Earnings from Service Operations").

The following table shows a reconciliation of our segment-level measures of profitability to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes, for the years ended

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes. PNOI excludes expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, PNOI may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Assets by Reportable Segment

The assets for each of the reportable segments at

December 31, 2018

and


were as follows (in thousands):

Tenant improvements and leasing costs to re-let rental space that we previously leased to tenants are referred to as second generation expenditures. Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties are also second generation expenditures. In addition to revenues and PNOI, we also review our second generation capital expenditures in measuring the performance of our individual Rental Operations segments. We review these expenditures to determine the costs associated with re-leasing vacant space and maintaining the condition of our properties. Our second generation capital expenditures by segment are summarized as follows for the years ended

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Both our first and second generation expenditures vary significantly between leases on a per square foot basis, dependent upon several factors including the product type, the nature of a tenant's operations, the specific physical characteristics of each individual property and the market in which the property is located.

Shareholders' Equity of the General Partner and Partners' Capital of the Partnership

General Partner

The General Partner periodically uses the public equity markets to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental properties or to pay down debt. The proceeds of these offerings are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for an additional interest in the Partnership.

During 2018, the General Partner issued

990,400

common shares pursuant to its ATM equity program, generating gross proceeds of approximately

$29.0 million

and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of approximately

$28.4 million

. The proceeds from these offerings were contributed to the Partnership and used to fund development activities and loan repayments.

During 2017, the General Partner did not issue any common shares pursuant to its ATM equity programs.

During 2016, the General Partner issued

8.4 million

common shares pursuant to its ATM equity program, generating gross proceeds of approximately

$218.2 million

and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net

proceeds of approximately

$215.6 million

. The proceeds from these offerings were contributed to the Partnership and used to fund development activities and loan repayments.

Partnership

For each common share or preferred share that the General Partner issues, the Partnership issues a corresponding Common Unit or Preferred Unit, as applicable, to the General Partner in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. Similarly, when the General Partner redeems or repurchases common shares or preferred shares, the Partnership redeems the corresponding Common Units or Preferred Units held by the General Partner at the same price.

(12)

Stock Based Compensation

We are authorized to issue up to

11.2 million

shares of the General Partner's common stock under our stock-based employee and non-employee compensation plans.

Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")

Under our


Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by the General Partner's shareholders in

April 2015

, and our


Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Compensation Plans"), RSUs may be granted to non-employee directors, executive officers and selected employees. A RSU is economically equivalent to a share of the General Partner's common stock and RSUs are valued based on the market price of the General Partner's common stock on the date of the award.

RSUs granted to employees from


to


vest ratably in most cases over a

three

-year period, and are payable in shares of our common stock with a new share of such common stock issued upon each RSU's vesting.  RSUs granted to employees prior to


vest ratably over a

five

-year period and are payable in the same manner.  RSUs granted to existing non-employee directors vest

100%

over

one

year and have contractual lives of

one

year.

To the extent that a recipient of a RSU grant is not determined to be retirement eligible, as defined by the Compensation Plans, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  Expense is recognized immediately at the date of grant to the extent a recipient is retirement eligible and expense is accelerated to the extent that a participant will become retirement eligible prior to the end of the contractual life of granted RSUs.

The following table summarizes transactions for our RSUs, excluding dividend equivalents, for

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

As of December 31, 2018, the following forward-starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges (in thousands, except number of instruments) were outstanding:

The fair value of our interest rate swap contracts was in a liability position as of December 31, 2018 and included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Partnership has guaranteed the repayment of

$23.7 million

of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We may be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

The Partnership also has guaranteed the repayment of loans associated with

one

of our unconsolidated joint ventures.  At

December 31, 2018

, the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately

$122.2 million

.

We lease certain land positions with terms extending to

December 31, 2065

, with a total future payment obligation of

$92.0 million

at December 31,


. No payments on these ground leases, which are classified as operating leases, are material in any individual year.

In addition to ground leases, we are party to other operating leases as part of conducting our business, including leases of office space from third parties, with a total future payment obligation of

$32.0 million

at December 31,


.  No future payments on these leases are material in any individual year.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

We own certain parcels of land that are subject to special property tax assessments levied by quasi municipal entities. To the extent that such special assessments are fixed and determinable, the discounted value of the full assessment is recorded as a liability.  We have

$10.9 million

of such special assessment liabilities, which are included within other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2018

.
