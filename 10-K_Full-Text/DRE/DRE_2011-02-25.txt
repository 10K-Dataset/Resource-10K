obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements for events or circumstances that arise after the statement is made, except as otherwise may be required by law.

This list of risks and uncertainties, however, is only a summary of some of the most important factors and is not intended to be exhaustive. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect
us is included under the caption “Risk Factors” in this Report, and is updated by us from time to time in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings that we make with the SEC.

PART I

Item 1.  Business

Background

We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of our initial public offering in February 1986. In October
1993, we completed an additional common stock offering and acquired the rental real estate and service businesses of Duke Associates, whose operations began in 1972. As of December 31, 2010, our diversified portfolio of 793 rental properties
(including 114 jointly controlled in-service properties with approximately 22.7 million square feet, eight consolidated properties under development with approximately 2.9 million square feet and two jointly controlled properties under
development with approximately 866,000 square feet) encompasses approximately 140.5 million rentable square feet and is leased by a diverse base of approximately 3,600 tenants whose businesses include government services, manufacturing,
retailing, wholesale trade, distribution, healthcare and professional services. We also own, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures, approximately 4,800 acres of land and control an additional 1,650 acres through
purchase options.

Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition, we have 17 regional offices
located in Alexandria, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Raleigh,
North Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Weston, Florida. We had approximately 1,000 employees as of December 31, 2010.

See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information related to our operations, asset and capital strategies.

Reportable Operating Segments

We have
three reportable operating segments, the first two of which consist of the ownership and rental of office and industrial real estate investments. The operations of our office and industrial properties, along with our medical office and retail
properties, are collectively referred to as “Rental Operations.” Our medical office and retail properties do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as reportable segments.

- 2 -


The third reportable segment consists of providing various real estate services such as property management,
asset management, maintenance, leasing, development and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively referred to as “Service Operations.” Our reportable segments offer different products or
services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary, a legal entity through which certain of the
segment’s operations are conducted. Through our Service Operations reportable segment, we have historically developed or acquired properties with the intent to sell (hereafter referred to as “Build-for-Sale” properties).
Build-for-Sale properties were generally identified as such prior to construction commencement and were sold within a relatively short time after being placed in service. Build-for-Sale properties, which are no longer part of our operating strategy,
did not represent a significant component of our operations in 2010 or 2009.

We assess and measure our overall operating results based upon
an industry performance measure referred to as Funds From Operations (“FFO”), which management believes is a useful indicator of our consolidated operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental
operating performance measure of an equity REIT like Duke. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation,
among other items, from net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss)
attributable to common shareholders. Consolidated FFO attributable to common shareholders should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have
historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as
defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation
and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of
consolidated FFO attributable to common shareholders, combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT
operating results more meaningful. Management believes that, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, investors and analysts are able to
readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity and assist in comparing these operating results between periods or as compared to different companies.

See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” for financial information related to our reportable segments.

Competitive Conditions

As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and
unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage both as a real estate operator and in future development activities.

We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or local levels. As a result, we intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market
share and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with
our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on strong customer relationships to provide third-party construction services across the United States. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to
our industrial, office and medical office customers not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.

All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators
generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply and demand of similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our
properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator. In addition, our Service Operations face competition
from a considerable number of other real estate companies that provide comparable services, some of whom may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us.

Corporate Governance

Since our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer
operationally, but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. Our system of governance reinforces this commitment. Summarized below are the highlights of our Corporate Governance initiatives.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this Report, you should carefully consider, in consultation with your legal, financial and other
professional advisors, the risks described below, as well as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption “Risk Factors” in evaluating us and our business before making a decision
regarding an investment in our securities.

The risks contained in this Report are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks that are
not presently known, or that we presently deem to be immaterial, also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. The trading price of our securities could decline due to the
materialization of any of these risks, and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment.

This Report also contains
forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section in this Report entitled
“Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.

Risks Related to Our Business

Our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required
principal and interest payments and the long-term risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness, or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be
able to refinance borrowings at our unconsolidated subsidiaries on favorable terms or at all. If our debt cannot be paid, refinanced or extended, we may not be able to make distributions to shareholders at expected levels. Further, if prevailing
interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher interest rates or other restrictive financial covenants upon the refinancing, then such refinancing would adversely affect our cash flow and funds available for operation,
development and distribution.

We are also subject to financial covenants under our existing debt instruments. Should we fail to comply with
the covenants in our existing debt instruments, then we would not only be in breach under the applicable debt instruments but we would also likely be unable to borrow any further amounts under our other debt instruments, which could adversely affect
our ability to fund operations. We also have incurred, and may incur in the future, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Thus, if market interest rates increase, so will our debt expense, which could reduce our cash flow and our
ability to make distributions to shareholders at expected levels.

Debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be
dilutive to our shareholders.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt
financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. Debt financing may not be available over a longer period of time in sufficient amounts, on
favorable terms or at all. If we issue additional equity securities, instead of debt, to manage capital needs, the interests of our existing shareholders could be diluted.

- 6 -


Financial and other covenants under existing credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely
affect our financial condition.

The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of
customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in
defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable
cash flow would be adversely affected.

Downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs or reduce our access to funding
sources in the credit and capital markets.

We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, consisting mostly of unsecured debt. We are
currently assigned corporate credit ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group (“S&P”) based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. These agencies’ ratings are based on a
number of factors, some of which are not within our control. In addition to factors specific to our financial strength and performance, the rating agencies also consider conditions affecting REITs generally. In January 2010, S&P downgraded our
credit rating. All of our debt ratings remain investment grade, but in light of the difficulties continuing to confront the economy generally, including, among others, the weak global economic conditions, credit market disruptions, and the severe
stress on commercial real estate markets, there can be no assurance that we will not be further downgraded or that any of our ratings will remain investment grade. If our credit ratings are further downgraded or other negative action is taken, we
could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.

Further credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of
obtaining funding as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

If we are unable to generate sufficient
capital and liquidity, then we may be unable to pursue future development projects and other strategic initiatives.

To complete our
ongoing and planned development projects, and to pursue our other strategic initiatives, we must continue to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to fund those activities. To generate that capital and liquidity, we rely upon funds from our
existing operations, as well as funds that we raise through our capital raising activities. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our long-term needs, or if we are unable to generate capital and
liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, then we may not be able to pursue development projects, acquisitions, or our other long-term strategic initiatives.

Our stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to our shareholders.

The market price of our common and preferred stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the
trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock, include
uncertainty in the markets, general market and economic conditions, as well as those factors described in these “Risk Factors” and in other reports that we file with the SEC.

- 7 -


Many of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of
our common and preferred stock. If the market prices of our common and preferred stock decline, then our shareholders may be unable to resell their shares upon terms that are attractive to them. We cannot assure that the market price of our common
and preferred stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the securities markets in general may experience considerable unexpected price and volume fluctuations.

We may issue debt and equity securities which are senior to our common stock and preferred stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could
negatively affect the value of our common and preferred stock.

In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by
entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by certain of our assets, or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes,
subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock and
preferred stock. Our preferred stock has a preference over our common stock with respect to distributions and upon liquidation, which could further limit our ability to make distributions to our common shareholders. Any additional preferred stock
that we may issue may have a preference over our common stock and existing series of preferred stock with respect to distributions and upon liquidation.

We may be required to seek commercial credit and issue debt securities to manage our capital needs. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market
conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of
our securities in the future. Thus, our shareholders will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of their shares of common stock and diluting their interest in us.

Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.

We
currently have joint ventures that are not consolidated with our financial statements. We may develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation
in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:

•

We could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property;

•

Our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of
properties;

•

Our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues; and

•

Maturities of debt encumbering our jointly owned investments may not be able to be refinanced at all or on terms that are as favorable as the current
terms.

- 8 -


Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders could decrease as a result of factors related to the ownership and operation
of commercial real estate that are outside of our control.

Our business is subject to the risks incident to the ownership and operation
of commercial real estate, many of which involve circumstances not within our control. Such risks include the following:

•

Changes in the general economic climate;

•

The availability of capital on favorable terms, or at all;

•

Increases in interest rates;

•

Local conditions such as oversupply of property or a reduction in demand;

•

Competition for tenants;

•

Changes in market rental rates;

•

Oversupply or reduced demand for space in the areas where our properties are located;

•

Delay or inability to collect rent from tenants who are bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise unwilling or unable to pay;

•

Difficulty in leasing or re-leasing space quickly or on favorable terms;

•

Costs associated with periodically renovating, repairing and reletting rental space;

•

Our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance on our properties;

•

Our ability to control variable operating costs;

•

Changes in government regulations; and

•

Potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, tax and other laws.

Further, a significant portion of our costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs and our debt service payments, are generally not
reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in cash flow from our properties. Any one or more of these factors could result in a reduction in our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders.

Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from properties decreases.

Our financial results depend on leasing space in our real estate to tenants on terms favorable to us. Our income and funds available for distribution to our shareholders will decrease if a significant
number of our tenants cannot meet their lease obligations to us or we are unable to lease properties on favorable terms. In addition, if a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and we may
incur substantial legal costs. Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment.

- 9 -


Our real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to development.

We continue to selectively develop new pre-leased properties for rental operations in our existing markets when accretive returns are present. These
development activities generally require various government and other approvals, which we may not receive. In addition, we also are subject to the following risks associated with development activities:

•

Unsuccessful development opportunities could result in direct expenses to us;

•

Construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated, or possibly
unprofitable;

•

Time required to complete the construction of a project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby
adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity;

•

Occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable;

•

Our ability to dispose of non-strategic properties we identify for sale could be impacted by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain financing
given the current state of the credit markets; and

•

Favorable sources to fund our development activities may not be available.

We may be unsuccessful in operating completed real estate projects.

We face the risk that
the real estate projects we develop or acquire will not perform in accordance with our expectations. This risk exists because of factors such as the following:

•

Prices paid for acquired facilities are based upon a series of market judgments; and

•

Costs of any improvements required to bring an acquired facility up to standards to establish the market position intended for that facility might
exceed budgeted costs.

Further, we can give no assurance that acquisition targets meeting our guidelines for quality and
yield will continue to be available.

We are exposed to the risks of defaults by tenants.

Any of our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken their financial condition. In the event of default or the insolvency of
a significant number of our tenants, we may experience a substantial loss of rental revenue and/or delays in collecting rent and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection, a court could
allow the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants became unable to meet their obligations to us, became insolvent or declared
bankruptcy.

We may be unable to renew leases or relet space.

When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if our tenants do renew or we are able to relet the space, the terms of renewal or
reletting (including the cost of renovations, if necessary) may be less favorable than current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space, or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly
lower than current rates, then our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected, especially if we were unable to lease a significant amount of the space vacated by tenants in our properties.

- 10 -


Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our facilities, including property, liability, fire, flood and extended coverage. We believe this coverage
is of the type and amount customarily obtained for real property. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not
economically insurable. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance
coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and
other factors also may make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive may not be adequate to restore our economic position in a
property. If an insured loss occurred, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property, and we would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property.
Although we believe our insurance is with highly rated providers, we are also subject to the risk that such providers may be unwilling or unable to pay our claims when made.

Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.

From time to time, we may acquire
properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay
substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:

•

liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

•

claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;

•

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

We could be exposed to significant environmental liabilities as a result of conditions of which we currently are not
aware.

As an owner and operator of real property, we may be liable under various federal, state and local laws for the costs of removal
or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. In addition, we
could have greater difficulty in selling real estate on which hazardous substances were present or in obtaining borrowings using such real estate as collateral. It is our general policy to have Phase I environmental audits performed for all of our
properties and land by qualified environmental consultants. These Phase I environmental audits have not revealed any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on our business. However, a Phase I environmental audit does not
involve invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, and we cannot be sure that the Phase I environmental audits did not fail to reveal a significant environmental liability or that a prior owner did not create a material
environmental condition on our properties or land which has not yet been discovered. We could also incur environmental liability as a result of future uses or conditions of such real estate or changes in applicable environmental laws.

We are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate-change related risks.

We are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic
weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase.

We do not currently consider that we are exposed to regulatory risk related to climate change. However, we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by stricter energy efficiency
standards for buildings.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

If we were to cease to qualify as a REIT, we and our shareholders would lose significant tax benefits.

We intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Qualification as
a REIT provides significant tax advantages to us and our shareholders. However, in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there
are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. Satisfaction of these requirements also depends on various factual circumstances not entirely within our control. The fact that we hold our assets through an operating partnership and its
subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Although we believe that we can continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot offer any
assurance that we will continue to do so or that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the qualification requirements or the federal income tax consequences of qualification. If
we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would have the following effects:

•

We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders and would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative
minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

•

Unless we were entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT;

•

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders would decrease due to the additional tax liability for the year or years
involved; and

•

We would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders in order to qualify as a REIT.

As such, failure to qualify as a REIT would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities.

REIT distribution requirements limit the amount of cash we have available for other business purposes, including amounts that we need to fund our
future capital needs.

To maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must annually distribute to our shareholders at least
90% of our ordinary taxable income, excluding net capital gains. We intend to continue to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the 90% distribution requirement. However, this requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital for
use for other business purposes. If we do not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements, we may have to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements. If we
fail to make a required distribution, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and investments in REITs may change, which may result in the
loss of our tax benefits of operating as a REIT.

The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of a REIT and an investment in a REIT may
be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time. Revisions in U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect us and the tax consequences of an investment in our common shares.

We are subject to certain provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, which may reduce the likelihood of our
shareholders receiving a control premium for their shares.

Indiana anti-takeover legislation and certain provisions in our governing
documents, as we discuss below, may discourage potential acquirers from pursuing a change-of-control transaction with us. As a result, our shareholders may be less likely to receive a control premium for their shares.

Unissued Preferred Stock.

Our charter permits our board of directors to classify unissued preferred stock by setting the rights and
preferences of the shares at the time of issuance. This power enables our board to adopt a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill. Although we have repealed our previously existing poison pill and our current board of directors has
adopted a policy not to issue preferred stock as an anti-takeover measure, our board can change this policy at any time. The adoption of a poison pill would discourage a potential bidder from acquiring a significant position in the company without
the approval of our board.

Business-Combination Provisions of Indiana Law.

We have not opted out of the business-combination
provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law. As a result, potential bidders may have to negotiate with our board of directors before acquiring 10% of our stock. Without securing board approval of the proposed business combination before
crossing the 10% ownership threshold, a bidder would not be permitted to complete a business combination for five years after becoming a 10% shareholder. Even after the five-year period, a business combination with the significant shareholder would
require a “fair price” as defined in the Indiana Business Corporation Law or the approval of a majority of the disinterested shareholders.

Control-Share-Acquisition Provisions of Indiana Law.

We have not opted out of the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law regarding acquisitions of control shares. Therefore, those
who acquire a significant block (at least 20%) of our shares may only vote a portion of their shares unless our other shareholders vote to accord full voting rights to the acquiring person. Moreover, if the other shareholders vote to give full
voting rights with respect to the control shares and the acquiring person has acquired a majority of our outstanding shares, the other shareholders would be entitled to special dissenters’ rights.

Supermajority Voting Provisions.

Our charter prohibits business combinations or significant disposition transactions with a holder of 10% of
our shares unless:

•

The holders of 80% of our outstanding shares of capital stock approve the transaction;

•

The transaction has been approved by three-fourths of those directors who served on the board before the shareholder became a 10% owner; or

•

The significant shareholder complies with the “fair price” provisions of our charter.

Among the transactions with large shareholders requiring the supermajority shareholder approval are dispositions of assets with a value greater than or
equal to $1,000,000 and business combinations.

- 13 -


Operating Partnership Provisions.

The limited partnership agreement of DRLP contains provisions
that could discourage change-of-control transactions, including a requirement that holders of at least 90% of the outstanding partnership units held by us and other unit holders approve:

•

Any voluntary sale, exchange, merger, consolidation or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of DRLP in one or more transactions
other than a disposition occurring upon a financing or refinancing of DRLP;

•

Our merger, consolidation or other business combination with another entity unless after the transaction substantially all of the assets of the
surviving entity are contributed to DRLP in exchange for units;

•

Our transfer of our interests in DRLP other than to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries; and

•

Any reclassification or recapitalization or change of outstanding shares of our common stock other than certain changes in par value, stock splits,
stock dividends or combinations.

We are dependent on key personnel.

Our executive officers and other senior officers have a significant role in the success of our Company. Our ability to retain our management group or to
attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave our Company is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their
availability could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data

The following sets forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for each of the years in the five-year period ended
December 31, 2010. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” included in this Form 10-K (in thousands, except per share amounts):

(1) Funds From Operations
(“FFO”) is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) like Duke Realty Corporation. The National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. Consolidated FFO attributable to common shareholders should
not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. FFO is calculated in
accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in
accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have
considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under
GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of consolidated FFO attributable to common shareholders, combined with net income (which remains the primary
measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of
previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, investors and analysts are able to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity
and assist in comparing these operating results between periods or as compared to different companies.

income (loss) attributable to common shareholders under the caption “Year in Review” under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

Business Overview

We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations through a related entity in 1972. As of December 31, 2010, we:

•

Owned or jointly controlled 793 industrial, office, medical office and other properties, of which 783 properties with more than 136.7 million
square feet are in service and ten properties with approximately 3.8 million square feet are under development. The 783 in-service properties are comprised of 669 consolidated properties with approximately 114.1 million square feet and 114
jointly controlled properties with approximately 22.7 million square feet. The ten properties under development consist of eight consolidated properties with approximately 2.9 million square feet and two jointly controlled properties with
approximately 866,000 square feet.

•

Owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures, approximately 4,800 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,650
acres through purchase options.

We have three reportable operating segments, the first two of which consist of the
ownership and rental of office and industrial real estate investments. The operations of our office and industrial properties, along with our medical office and retail properties, are collectively referred to as “Rental Operations.” Our
medical office and retail properties do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as reportable segments.

The third
reportable segment consists of providing various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively
referred to as “Service Operations.” Our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Our Service Operations
segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary, a legal entity through which certain of the segment’s operations are conducted.

Through our Service Operations reportable segment, we have historically developed or acquired properties with the intent to sell (hereafter referred to
as “Build-for-Sale” properties). Build-for-Sale properties were generally identified as such prior to construction commencement and were sold within a relatively short time after being placed in service. Build-for-Sale properties, which
are no longer part of our operating strategy, did not represent a significant component of our operations in 2010 or 2009.

Operations
Strategy

Our operational focus is to drive profitability, by maximizing cash from operations as well as Funds from Operations
(“FFO”) through (i) maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing new pre-leased medical office and build-to-suit projects
at accretive returns; (iii) leveraging our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction manager on a fee basis; and (iv) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.

- 20 -


Asset Strategy

Our asset strategy is to reposition our investment among product types and further diversify our geographic presence. Our strategic objectives include (i) increasing our investment in quality
industrial properties in both existing markets and select new markets; (ii) expanding our medical office portfolio nationally to take advantage of demographic trends; (iii) increasing our asset investment in markets we believe provide the
best potential for future growth; and (iv) reducing our investment in suburban office properties located primarily in the Midwest as well as reducing our investment in other non-strategic assets. We are executing our asset strategy through our
disciplined approach in identifying accretive acquisition opportunities and our focused development initiatives, which are financed primarily from our active asset disposition program.

Capital Strategy

Our capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by
actively managing the components of our capital structure, in coordination with the execution of our overall operating and asset strategy. We are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies with the ultimate goal
of improving the key metrics that formulate our credit ratings.

In support of our capital strategy, as well as our asset strategy, we employ
an asset disposition program to sell non-strategic real estate assets, which generates proceeds that can be recycled primarily into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives both within the industrial and medical office product
types and in markets that provide the best future growth potential.

We continue to focus on improving our balance sheet by maintaining a
balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less
than 20%; (iii) issuing common equity from time-to-time to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic acquisitions; and (iv) generating proceeds from the sale of non-strategic properties. With our successes
to date and continued focus on strengthening our balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned for future growth.

Year in Review

After the recessionary conditions of 2008 and most of 2009, the economy and business fundamentals improved during 2010, although
unemployment, tax legislation matters and related issues remained key areas of concern. There also continued to be an oversupply of leasable space in many markets and product types, particularly in suburban office properties, as improvement in the
commercial real estate industry lagged behind improvement in many other areas of the general economy. Many property owners continued to reduce rental rates and offer increased capital expenditure allowances in order to compete for the available
transactions in the marketplace. During 2010, however, we had a strong increase in leasing volume, which helped offset rental rate decreases that continued in many markets.

We also made significant progress during 2010 on our asset strategy of increasing our industrial and medical office portfolio while reducing our exposure to suburban office properties, primarily through
our disposition and acquisition activity. Overall, we believe 2010 was a successful year in all aspects of our strategic focus. The efforts in our operations, asset and capital strategies contributed to our positive performance.

Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $14.1 million,
or $.07 per share (diluted), compared to a net loss of $333.6 million, or $1.67 per share (diluted) for the year ended December 31, 2009. The significant reduction in net loss from 2009 was the result of a $292.7 million decrease in non-cash
impairment charges as well as a $53.6 million increase in gains on sales of properties. Partially offsetting the positive changes in impairment charges and property sales was a $28.1 million increase in interest expense that was primarily driven by
a decrease in interest costs capitalized to development projects. FFO attributable to common shareholders totaled $298.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $12.9 million for 2009, with the increase resulting from the same
factors, excluding gains on property sales, which improved the results attributable to common shareholders in 2010.

Industry analysts and
investors use FFO as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes
historical cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP
measure is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. Consolidated FFO attributable to common shareholders should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived
in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT.

periods or as compared to different companies. The following table shows a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to the calculation of consolidated FFO attributable to common shareholders for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands):

As the economy improved in 2010, we executed in all areas of the operations, asset, and capital strategies that we
established in 2009. Of specific note was the significant progress made in our efforts to increase the concentration within our portfolio towards the industrial and medical office product types in stronger growth markets. Highlights of our 2010
strategic activities are as follows:

•

On July 1, 2010, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 50% interest in Dugan Realty, L.L.C. (“Dugan”), a real estate joint
venture that we had previously accounted for using the equity method, for a net cash payment of $138.6 million. As the result of this transaction, we obtained 100% of Dugan’s membership interests. Dugan had secured debt, which, at the time of
acquisition, had a total face value of $283.0 million. Dugan owned 106 industrial buildings totaling 20.8 million square feet and 62.6 net acres of undeveloped land located in Midwest and Southeast markets.

•

On December 30, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the first tranche of the Premier Realty Corporation South Florida property portfolio (the
“Premier Portfolio”) for $281.7 million, including the assumption of secured debt that had a face value of $155.7 million. The first tranche includes 39 buildings, totaling more than 3.4 million square feet, nearly all of which are
industrial properties. The Premier Portfolio, in its entirety, includes 51 industrial and five office buildings with over 4.9 million rentable square feet and four ground leases, for a total price of approximately $449.4 million. The remainder
of the acquisition is under contract and expected to close in early 2011, subject to the execution of certain debt assumptions and customary closing conditions.

•

We generated $499.5 million of total net cash proceeds from the disposition of 36 wholly-owned buildings, either through outright sales or partial
sales to unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as 130 acres of wholly-owned undeveloped land. Included in the wholly-owned building dispositions in 2010 is the sale of seven suburban office buildings, totaling over 1.0 million square feet, to
a newly formed subsidiary of an existing 20% owned joint venture. These buildings were sold to the joint venture for an agreed value of $173.9 million, of which our 80% share of proceeds totaled $139.1 million. We expect to sell additional buildings
to this joint venture by the end of the second quarter 2011, subject to financing and other customary closing conditions. The total 2011 sale is under contract and expected to consist of 13 office buildings, totaling over 2.0 million square
feet, with an agreed upon value of $342.8 million, which is expected to generate proceeds of $274.2 million for the 80% portion that we sell.

•

We have limited our new development starts to selected projects in markets or product types expected to have strong future rent growth and demand or
projects that have significant pre-leasing. The total estimated cost of our consolidated properties under construction was $151.5 million at December 31, 2010 with $47.2 million of such costs incurred through that date. Our total estimated cost
for jointly controlled properties under construction was $176.0 million at December 31, 2010 with $106.2 million of costs incurred through that date.

- 23 -


•

The occupancy level for our in-service portfolio of consolidated properties increased from 87.6% at December 31, 2009 to 89.1% at
December 31, 2010. The increase in occupancy was driven by a significant increase in total leasing volume as, during 2010, we had our highest total leasing volume since 2007. A significant portion of the leasing volume in 2010 was related to
buildings where development was started on a speculative basis between 2005 and 2008.

•

Despite the continued challenges presented by the overall economy, total leasing activity for our consolidated properties totaled 20.4 million
square feet in 2010 compared to 15.3 million square feet in 2009.

•

Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties in 2010 included 10.1 million square feet of renewals, which represented a 77.2% success
rate but resulted in a 4.9% reduction in net effective rents.

We executed a number of significant
transactions in support of our capital strategy during 2010 in order to optimally sequence our unsecured debt maturities, manage our overall leverage profile, and support our acquisition strategy. Highlights of our key financing activities in 2010
are as follows:

•

In January 2010, we repaid $99.8 million of senior unsecured notes, which had an effective interest rate of 5.37%, on their scheduled maturity date.

•

In April 2010, we issued $250.0 million of 10-year unsecured debt, which bears interest at an effective rate of 6.75%.

•

In June 2010, we issued 26.5 million shares of common stock at $11.75 per share, which generated net proceeds of $298.1 million.

•

During 2010, through a cash tender offer and open market transactions, we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to
mature in 2011 and 2013, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of 4.48%. In total, we repurchased unsecured notes that had a face value of $279.9 million.

•

During 2010, we also completed open market repurchases of approximately 4.5 million shares of our 8.375% Series O preferred stock. We repurchased
preferred shares that had a face value of $112.1 million.

Key Performance Indicators

Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our industrial, office, medical office and retail properties (collectively referred to as
“Rental Operations”). The following discussion highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider critical drivers of future revenues.

Occupancy Analysis:

As discussed above, our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue from continuing operations. The
following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in-service portfolio of consolidated rental properties as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

- 24 -


The increase in occupancy at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 is primarily because
we achieved a volume of executed leases in 2010 that was the highest since 2007, with a significant portion of that volume related to buildings where development was started on a speculative basis between 2005 and 2008. Our ongoing ability to
maintain favorable occupancy levels may be adversely affected by the continued effects of the economic recession on current and prospective tenants and such a reduction in the level of occupancy may have an adverse impact on revenues from rental
operations.

Lease Expiration and Renewals:

Our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates primarily depends upon our
continuing ability to re-lease expiring space. The following table reflects our consolidated in-service portfolio lease expiration schedule by property type as of December 31, 2010. The table indicates square footage and annualized net
effective rents (based on December 2010 rental revenue) under expiring leases (in thousands, except percentage data):

We renewed 77.2% and 82.0% of our leases up for renewal totaling approximately 10.1 million and
8.8 million square feet in 2010 and 2009, respectively. There was a 4.9% decline in net effective rents on these renewals during 2010, compared to a 2.2% increase in 2009. Although general economic conditions have improved since 2009, there
continues to be an over-supply of rentable space in many markets that has necessitated a continuation of the 2009 trend toward a reduction in overall rental rates in order to maintain occupancy. Our lease renewal percentages over the past three
years have remained at a relatively consistent success rate. The effects of future economic conditions upon our base of existing tenants may adversely affect our ability to continue to achieve this renewal rate.

Acquisition and Disposition Activity:

In 2010, we consolidated 106 industrial buildings as the result of acquiring Dugan. We also acquired
38 industrial buildings and one office building as a result of closing the first tranche of the Premier Portfolio. We expect to complete the purchase of the Premier Portfolio, which is under contract, in early 2011 and will continue to evaluate
other acquisition opportunities to the extent they support our overall strategy. In addition to these two transactions, we purchased an additional 10 industrial buildings, two office buildings and one medical office building in 2010. Including the
additional 50% ownership interest in Dugan, we acquired real estate and other assets totaling $901.5 million in 2010.

In 2009, we acquired
$32.1 million of income producing properties comprised of three industrial real estate properties in Savannah, Georgia.

- 25 -


Net cash proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned undeveloped land and buildings totaled $499.5
million in 2010, compared to $288.2 million in 2009. Included in the wholly owned building dispositions in 2010 is the previously mentioned sale of seven suburban office buildings, totaling over 1.0 million square feet, to a newly formed
subsidiary of an existing 20% owned joint venture. Our share of proceeds from sales of properties from within unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have less than a 100% interest totaled $15.0 million in 2010, and we had no such dispositions in
2009.

We intend to pursue additional disposition opportunities for non-strategic properties and land in accordance with our strategy. We
believe that the number of dispositions we execute in 2011 will be impacted by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain favorable financing or pay cash, given the current state of the economy and credit markets in particular.

Future Development:

Another source of our earnings growth is our wholly owned and joint venture development activities. We expect to
generate future earnings from Rental Operations as the development properties are placed in service and leased. During 2010, we directed a significant portion of our available resources toward acquisition activities as well as limited our
development activities to pre-leased industrial and medical office product types. We believe these two product lines will be the areas of greatest future growth.

We had 3.8 million square feet of consolidated or jointly controlled properties under development with total estimated costs upon completion of $327.5 million at December 31, 2010, compared to
1.6 million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of $440.6 million at December 31, 2009. The square footage and estimated costs include both wholly owned and joint venture development activity at 100%.

Comparison of Year Ended
December 31, 2010 to Year Ended December 31, 2009

Rental and Related Revenue

The following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
2009, respectively (in thousands):

The primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations, with specific references to a particular
segment when applicable, are summarized below:

•

We consolidated 106 industrial buildings as a result of acquiring our joint venture partner’s 50% interest in Dugan on July 1, 2010. The
consolidation of these buildings resulted in an increase of $38.7 million in rental and related revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009.

•

Including the December 30, 2010 acquisition of the first tranche of the Premier Portfolio, we acquired or consolidated an additional 56 properties
and placed 18 developments in service from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010, which provided incremental revenues of $29.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.

•

We contributed 15 properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in 2009 and 2010, resulting in a $9.2 million reduction in rental and related revenue
in 2010.

•

We sold eight properties in 2009 and 2010 that were excluded from discontinued operations as a result of continuing involvement in the properties
through management agreements. These dispositions resulted in a decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations of $7.5 million in 2010.

•

Rental and related revenue includes lease termination fees, which relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligation before
the end of the contractual lease term. Lease termination fees included in continuing operations decreased from $12.3 million in 2009 to $6.7 million in 2010.

- 27 -


•

Average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased slightly for our office properties, while increasing for our industrial
properties, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. These changes in occupancy, as well as decreases in rental rates in certain of our 2010 lease renewals, resulted in a net decrease to rental and related revenues which partially
offset the increases generated from acquisitions and developments placed in service.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate
Taxes

The following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the
statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands):

Of the overall $5.7 million increase in rental expenses in 2010 compared to 2009, $4.4 million was attributable to the
consolidation of the 106 industrial buildings in Dugan. There were also incremental costs of $6.2 million associated with the additional 56 properties acquired or otherwise consolidated and 18 developments placed in service. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease in rental expenses of approximately $3.3 million related to 23 properties that were sold in 2009 and 2010, but did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations.

Overall, real estate taxes increased by $6.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The primary reason for this increase is the consolidation of an additional
106 industrial buildings related to the acquisition of Dugan, which resulted in incremental real estate taxes of $7.1 million. There were also incremental costs of $3.1 million associated with the additional 56 properties acquired or otherwise
consolidated and 18 developments placed in service. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate taxes of approximately $2.7 million related to 23 properties that were sold in 2009 and 2010, but did not meet the criteria for
classification as discontinued operations.

Service Operations

The following table sets forth the components of the Service Operations reportable segment (excluding Build-for-Sale Properties) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in
thousands):

Service Operations primarily consist of the leasing, property management, asset management, development, construction
management and general contractor services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. Service Operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as leasing and property management fees are dependent upon
occupancy while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners

- 28 -


and joint venture partners. The increase in earnings from Service Operations was largely the result of an overall increase in third-party construction volume and fees.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $323.4 million in 2009 to $349.1 million in 2010 due to increases in our real estate asset base from
properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service during 2010 and 2009. The consolidation of 106 additional industrial properties related to the July 1, 2010 acquisition of our partner’s ownership interest in Dugan
resulted in $25.4 million of additional depreciation expense.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income or loss from investments in unconsolidated companies that generally own and operate
rental properties and develop properties for sale. Equity in earnings decreased from $9.9 million in 2009 to $8.0 million in 2010. The decrease was largely the result of the acquisition of Dugan, which was previously accounted for under the equity
method, which took place on July 1, 2010.

Gain on Sale of Properties

Gains on sales of properties classified in continuing operations increased from $12.3 million in 2009 to $39.7 million in 2010. We sold nine properties in 2009 compared to 17 properties in 2010. Because
the properties sold in 2009 and 2010 either had insignificant operations prior to sale or because we maintained varying forms of continuing involvement after sale, they are not classified within discontinued operations. Seven of the properties sold
in 2010, with a combined gain on sale of $31.9 million, were made to a newly formed subsidiary of an existing 20% owned joint venture to which we expect to sell additional properties during 2011.

Impairment Charges

Impairment charges
classified in continuing operations include the impairment of undeveloped land and buildings, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other real estate related assets. The decrease from $275.6 million in 2009 to $9.8 million in 2010 is
primarily due to the following activity:

•

In 2010, we sold approximately 60 acres of land, in two separate transactions, which resulted in impairment charges of $9.8 million. These sales were
opportunistic in nature and we had not identified or actively marketed this land for disposition, as it was previously intended to be held for development.

•

A result of the refinement of our business strategy that took place in 2009 was the decision to dispose of approximately 1,800 acres of land, which had
a total cost basis of $385.3 million, rather than holding it for future development. Our change in strategy for this land triggered the requirement to conduct an impairment analysis, which resulted in a determination that a significant portion of
the land, representing over 35% of the land’s carrying value, was impaired. We recognized impairment charges on land of $136.6 million in 2009, primarily as the result of writing down to fair value the land that was identified for
disposition and determined to be impaired.

•

Also in 2009, an impairment charge of $78.1 million was recognized for 28 office, industrial and retail buildings. Nine of these properties met the
criteria for discontinued operations at December 31, 2010, either as a result of being sold or classified as held-for-sale, and the $26.9 million of

- 29 -


impairment charges related to these properties is accordingly reflected in discontinued operations. The impairment analysis was triggered either as the result of changes in management’s
strategy, resulting in certain buildings being identified as non-strategic, or changes in market conditions.

•

We hold a 50% ownership interest in an unconsolidated entity (the “3630 Peachtree joint venture”) whose sole activity is the development and
operation of the office component of a multi-use office and residential high-rise building located in the Buckhead sub-market of Atlanta. We recognized an impairment charge in 2009 to write off our $14.4 million investment in the 3630 Peachtree
joint venture as the result of an other-than-temporary decline in value. As a result of the joint venture’s obligations to the lender in its construction loan agreement, the likelihood that our partner will be unable to contribute their share
of the additional equity to fund the joint venture’s future capital costs, and ultimately from our contingent obligation stemming from our joint and several guarantee of the joint venture’s loan, we recorded an additional liability of
$36.3 million in 2009 for our probable future obligation to the lender.

•

In 2009, we recognized a $5.8 million charge on our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (the “Park Creek joint venture”).

•

We recognized $31.5 million of impairment charges on other real estate related assets in 2009, which related primarily to reserving loans receivable
from other real estate entities, as well as writing off previously deferred development costs.

General and
Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense decreased from $47.9 million in 2009 to $41.3 million in 2010. General and
administrative expenses consist of two components. The first component includes general corporate expenses and the second component includes the indirect operating costs not allocated to the development or operations of our owned properties and
Service Operations. The decrease in general and administrative expenses resulted from a $9.6 million reduction in our total overhead costs, which was largely a result of reduced severance charges when compared to 2009. The reduction in overall
overhead expenses was partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in overhead costs absorbed by an allocation to leasing, construction and other areas, which was primarily a result of lower wholly owned construction and development activities than
in 2009.

Interest Expense

Interest expense from continuing operations increased from $206.0 million in 2009 to $239.4 million in 2010. The increase was largely the result of a
$15.4 million decrease in the capitalization of interest costs, due to properties previously undergoing significant development activities being placed in service or otherwise not meeting the criteria for the capitalization of interest. The
remaining increase in interest expense was largely the result of our 2010 acquisition activity which, in addition to other uses of capital, drove higher overall borrowings in 2010.

- 30 -


Gain (Loss) on Debt Transactions

During 2010, through a cash tender offer and open market transactions, we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in 2011 and 2013. In total, we paid $292.2
million for unsecured notes that had a face value of $279.9 million. We recognized a net loss on extinguishment of $16.3 million after considering the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts and other accounting adjustments.

During 2009, we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in 2009 through 2011. The majority of
our debt repurchases during 2009 were of our 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Exchangeable Notes”). In total, we paid $500.9 million for unsecured notes that had a face value of $542.9 million, recognizing a net gain on extinguishment of
$27.5 million after considering the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts and other accounting adjustments. Partially offsetting these gains, we recognized $6.8 million of expense in 2009 for the write-off of fees paid for a
pending secured financing that we cancelled in the third quarter of 2009.

Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax benefit of $1.1 million and $6.1 million, respectively, in 2010 and 2009.

We recorded a net valuation allowance of $7.3 million against our deferred tax assets during 2009. The valuation allowance was recorded as the result of
changes to our projections for future taxable income within our taxable REIT subsidiary. The decreased projection of taxable income was the result of a revision in strategy, whereby we determined that we would indefinitely discontinue the
development of Build-for-Sale properties, necessitating the revision of our taxable income projections.

Discontinued Operations

The results of operations for properties sold during the year to unrelated parties or classified as held-for-sale at the end of the
period, and meet the applicable criteria, are required to be classified as discontinued operations. The property specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate
taxes, allocated interest expense and depreciation expense, impairment charges as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties.

The operations of 41 buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations. These 41 properties consist of 12 industrial, 27 office, and two retail properties. As a result, we classified income,
before gain on sales and impairment charges, of $2.7 million, $2.9 million and $8.5 million in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Of these properties, 19 were sold during 2010, five properties were sold during 2009 and eight properties were sold during 2008. The gains on disposal of these properties of $33.1 million, $6.8 million
and $17.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are also reported in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations also includes impairment charges of $26.9 million and $1.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, recognized on properties that were subsequently sold. There are nine properties classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2010.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2009 to Year Ended December 31, 2008

Rental and Related Revenue

The
following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands):

- 31 -


The primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations, with specific references to a particular
segment when applicable, are summarized below:

•

In 2009, we acquired three properties, consolidated two retail properties in which we previously had a partial ownership interest, and placed 15
developments in service. The acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of $1.4 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The two retail properties that were consolidated in 2009 provided $16.3 million of incremental revenues. Of the
development properties placed in service in 2009, ten were medical office properties accounting for $4.1 million of the $7.2 million incremental revenues.

•

Acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in 2008 provided $422,000 and $31.9 million, respectively, of incremental revenue in 2009.

•

Lease termination fees included in rental and related revenue from continuing operations increased from $9.2 million in 2008 to $12.3 million in 2009.

•

We contributed five properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in 2008, resulting in a $2.2 million reduction in revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008.

•

The increase in rental revenues was partially offset by a $6.8 million increase in expense related to doubtful receivables, including both contractual
and straight-line receivables, as a result of economic conditions during 2009.

•

Decreases in rental rates and occupancy in certain of our existing properties, resulting from the economy’s impact on the leasing environment,
partially offset the above-mentioned items.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations
for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands):

Of the overall $12.9 million increase in rental expenses in 2009 compared to 2008, $10.2 million was attributable to
properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009.

- 32 -


Of the overall $15.3 million increase in real estate taxes in 2009 compared to 2008, $9.8 million was
attributable to properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. The remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in tax rates and assessed values on
our existing properties.

Service Operations

The following table sets forth the components of the Service Operations reportable segment (excluding Build-for-Sale Properties) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in
thousands):

The increase in earnings from Service Operations was primarily a result of general contractor expenses being higher than
usual in 2008 as a result of increases in our total cost estimates for two third-party fixed price construction contracts, which reduced the margins on the contracts.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased
from $293.0 million in 2008 to $323.4 million in 2009 due to increases in our real estate asset base from properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service during 2008 and 2009.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings decreased from $23.8 million in 2008 to $9.9 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily a result of our share of the gain on sale of five properties from unconsolidated subsidiaries in
2008 totaling $10.1 million, compared to no such sales in 2009. The decreased gains on property sales were partially offset as the result of consolidating two retail joint ventures in April 2009, for which our share of net loss was $3.5 million in
2008. The remaining decrease in equity in earnings is primarily due to a decrease in operating income within certain of our joint ventures due to decreased occupancy in the underlying rental properties.

Gain on Sale of Properties

Gains on
sales of properties decreased from $39.1 million in 2008 to $12.3 million in 2009. We sold 14 properties in 2008 compared to nine properties in 2009. The properties sold in 2008 were part of our Build-for-Sale program, which is no longer a
significant part of our Service Operations. Because the properties sold in 2008 and 2009 either had insignificant operations prior to sale or because we maintained varying forms of continuing involvement after sale, they are not classified within
discontinued operations.

Earnings from Sales of Land

Earnings from sales of land decreased from $12.7 million in 2008 to $357,000 in 2009. The decrease in earnings was the result of the current state of the real estate market, as fewer developers are
willing to make speculative purchases of land for future development.

Impairment Charges

Impairment charges classified in continuing operations include the impairment of undeveloped land and buildings, investments in unconsolidated
subsidiaries and other real estate related assets. The increase

- 33 -


from $10.2 million in 2008 to $275.6 million in 2009 is primarily due to a refinement of our business strategy coupled with decreases in real estate values and is comprised of the following
activity:

•

A result of the refinement of our business strategy that took place in 2009 was the decision to dispose of approximately 1,800 acres of land, which had
a total cost basis of $385.3 million, rather than holding it for future development. Our change in strategy for this land triggered the requirement to conduct an impairment analysis, which resulted in a determination that a significant portion of
the land, representing over 35% of the land’s carrying value, was impaired. We recognized impairment charges on land of $136.6 million in 2009, primarily as the result of writing down to fair value the land that was identified for
disposition and determined to be impaired.

•

Also in 2009, an impairment charge of $78.1 million was recognized for 28 office, industrial and retail buildings. Nine of these properties met the
criteria for discontinued operations, either as a result of being sold or classified as held-for-sale, and the $26.9 million of impairment charges related to these properties is accordingly reflected in discontinued operations. The impairment
analysis was triggered either as the result of changes in management’s strategy, resulting in certain buildings being identified as non-strategic, or changes in market conditions.

•

We recognized an impairment charge in 2009 to write off our $14.4 million investment in the 3630 Peachtree joint venture as the result of an
other-than-temporary decline in value. As a result of the joint venture’s obligations to the lender in its construction loan agreement, the likelihood that our partner will be unable to contribute their share of the additional equity to fund
the joint venture’s future capital costs, and ultimately from our contingent obligation stemming from our joint and several guarantee of the joint venture’s loan, we recorded an additional liability of $36.3 million in 2009 for our
probable future obligation to the lender.

•

In 2009, we recognized a $5.8 million charge on our investment in the Park Creek joint venture.

•

We recognized $31.5 million of impairment charges on other real estate related assets in 2009, which related primarily to reserving loans receivable
from other real estate entities, as well as writing off previously deferred development costs.

•

In 2008, as the result of a re-assessment of our intended use of some of our land holdings, we recognized non-cash impairment charges on seven of our
tracts of undeveloped land totaling $8.6 million. Also, as the result of the economy’s negative effect on real estate selling prices, we recognized $2.8 million of impairment charges on two of our Build-for-Sale properties that were under
construction at December 31, 2008, and were expected to sell in 2009. One of these properties met the criteria for discontinued operations upon sale and the $1.3 million impairment charge related to this property is accordingly reflected in
discontinued operations.

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased from $39.5 million in 2008 to $47.9 million in 2009. The increase in general and administrative expenses is
primarily the result of a $4.8 million increase in severance pay. Other than this expense item, we reduced our total overhead costs by $22.7 million to compensate for the reduction in the volume of leasing and construction activity. However, the
absorption of actual overhead costs by an allocation to leasing, construction and other areas decreased by $26.3 million, which, when netted with the $22.7 million reduction in costs, resulted in the remaining increase in general and administrative
expenses.

- 34 -


Interest Expense

Interest expense from continuing operations increased from $184.0 million in 2008 to $206.0 million in 2009, primarily as a result of a $26.6 million decrease in capitalization of interest costs, due to
properties previously undergoing significant development activities being placed in service or otherwise not meeting the criteria for the capitalization of interest. Additionally, as the result of the conditions in the credit markets driving up
interest rates on new borrowings in 2009, the weighted average interest rate on our total outstanding borrowings increased from 5.43% at December 31, 2008 to 6.36% at December 31, 2009.

Gain on Debt Transactions

During 2009,
we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in 2009 through 2011. The majority of our debt repurchases during 2009 were of our Exchangeable Notes. In total, we paid $500.9 million for unsecured notes that
had a face value of $542.9 million, recognizing a net gain on extinguishment of approximately $27.5 million after considering the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts and other accounting adjustments. Partially offsetting
these gains, we recognized $6.8 million of expense in 2009 for the write-off of fees paid for a pending secured financing that we cancelled in the third quarter of 2009.

Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax benefit of $6.1 million and $7.0 million,
respectively, in 2009 and 2008.

We recorded a net valuation allowance of $7.3 million against our deferred tax assets during 2009. The
valuation allowance was recorded as the result of changes to our projections for future taxable income within our taxable REIT subsidiary. The decreased projection of taxable income was the result of a revision in strategy, whereby we determined
that we would indefinitely discontinue the development of Build-for-Sale properties, necessitating the revision of our taxable income projections. Notwithstanding the valuation allowance recorded during 2009, our taxable REIT subsidiary recognized
significantly higher taxable losses in 2009 than in 2008 as the result of the timing and profitability of land and building sales.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are
inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of
our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our Audit Committee and independent auditors. The following accounting policies are
considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:

Accounting for Joint Ventures:

We analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is a variable interest entity (a
“VIE”) and would require consolidation. We (i) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity at risk, (ii) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group, and whether there are
any guaranteed returns, protection against

- 35 -


losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (iii) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in
making this VIE determination. We would consolidate a venture that is determined to be a VIE if we were the primary beneficiary. Beginning January 1, 2010, a new accounting standard became effective and changed the method by which the primary
beneficiary of a VIE is determined to a primarily qualitative approach whereby the variable interest holder, if any, that controls a VIE’s most significant activities is the primary beneficiary. To the extent that our joint ventures do not
qualify as VIEs, we further assess each partner’s substantive participating rights to determine if the venture should be consolidated.

We have equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. To the extent applicable,
we consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be VIE’s where we are the primary beneficiary. For non-variable interest entities, we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we
are the managing entity and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day-to-day operations, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture
without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner. We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial policies. Under
the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were
contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in
earnings of the joint venture. We recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner’s interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

Cost Capitalization

: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction, leasing or
expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs
associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion
and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.

We also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being
incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a
vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90%
occupancy. In addition, all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized.

In assessing the
amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction, development and leasing) and those for which capitalization
is not warranted (i.e., property management,

- 36 -


maintenance, acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities,
the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in
the same proportion as payroll costs.

To ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized costs that are
allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease.
These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful
projects or leasing activities are not capitalized.

Impairment of Real Estate Assets:

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the
exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying
amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our
estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other
tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ
materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the
carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable
transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace
participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset’s
undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.

To the extent applicable marketplace data is available, we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired.

Real estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to
sell.

Acquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets:

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible
and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values. Beginning January 1, 2009, we record assets acquired in step acquisitions at their full fair value and record a gain or

- 37 -


loss for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our existing equity interest. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2009, contingencies arising from a business
combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.

The allocation to
tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management’s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors
considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated among three
categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and the value of customer relationships.

•

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using an interest
rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would be paid
using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the
balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

•

The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and to customer relationship values, based upon management’s
assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer
relationship, as applicable.

Valuation of Receivables:

We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could
affect the collection of rent due under leases or of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on major existing tenants and prospective tenants before leases are executed. We have established
the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables and record allowances:

•

We maintain a tenant “watch list” containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at
risk. Various factors such as late rent payments, lease or debt instrument defaults, and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list.

•

As a matter of policy, we reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90 days.

•

Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long-term risk, regardless of the status
of current rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

Construction Contracts:

We recognize income on
construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method. Using this method, profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts. A
portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract. To the extent that a fixed-price contract is estimated to result in a loss, the loss is recorded immediately.
Cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract’s term. This revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with
those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes.

With regard to critical accounting policies, management has discussed the following with the Audit
Committee:

•

Criteria for identifying and selecting our critical accounting policies;

•

Methodology in applying our critical accounting policies; and

•

Impact of the critical accounting policies on our financial statements.

The Audit Committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

As the result of
generating capital in excess of $1.0 billion through a common equity issuance, unsecured borrowings, and property dispositions, we have more than sufficient capacity to meet our short-term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months.

In addition to our existing sources of liquidity, we expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and
unsecured debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and other non-recurring capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow and accessing the public debt and equity markets.

Rental Operations

Cash flows from Rental Operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable cash flow to fund operational expenses. We believe that this
cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are
generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition.

We are subject to a number of risks related to
general economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and bankruptcies, and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, each of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations. In 2010,
we recognized $5.9 million of expense related to reserving doubtful receivables, including reserves on straight-line rent, compared to $12.0 million in 2009.

Unsecured Debt and Equity Securities

Our unsecured lines of credit as of
December 31, 2010 are described as follows (in thousands):

The DRLP unsecured line of credit has
a borrowing capacity of $850.0 million with an interest rate on borrowings of LIBOR plus 2.75% (equal to 3.01% for borrowings as of December 31, 2010), and matures in February 2013. Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an
option to increase the facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, for a total of up to $1.05 billion. This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line, at rates that
may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us
to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset

- 39 -


value being defined in the DRLP unsecured line of credit agreement). As of December 31, 2010, we were
in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

At December 31, 2010, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf
registration statement on Form S-3, relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of DRLP’s debt securities (including guarantees thereof) and the Company’s common shares, preferred shares, and other
securities. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long-term debt upon maturity.

Pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement, at December 31, 2010 we had on file with the SEC a prospectus supplement that allows us to
issue new shares of our common stock, from time to time, with an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million. No new shares have been issued pursuant to this prospectus supplement as of December 31, 2010.

The indentures (and related supplemental indentures) governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other
covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2010.

Sale of Real Estate
Assets

We pursue opportunities to sell non-strategic real estate assets in order to generate additional liquidity. Our ability to
dispose of such properties is dependent on the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. In light of current market and economic conditions, including, without limitation, the
availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, and condition of the equity and real estate markets, we may be unable to dispose of such properties quickly, or on favorable terms.

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities

Transactions with unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity. From time to time we will sell properties to an unconsolidated entity, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to the interest that
we do not own. Additionally, unconsolidated entities will from time to time obtain debt financing and will distribute to us, and our joint venture partners, all or a portion of the proceeds.

We have a 20% equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture (“Duke/Hulfish, LLC”) that may acquire up to $800.0 million of our newly developed build-to-suit projects over a three-year
period from its formation in May 2008. Properties are sold to the joint venture upon completion, lease commencement and satisfaction of other customary conditions. We have received cumulative net sale and financing proceeds, commensurate to our
partner’s ownership interest, of approximately $380.4 million through December 31, 2010 related to the joint venture’s acquisition of 15 of our properties.

In December 2010, we formed a new joint venture (“Duke/Princeton, LLC”) which is a wholly owned subsidiary of, and with the same membership composition and ownership percentages as,
Duke/Hulfish, LLC. We made an initial sale of seven suburban office buildings, totaling over 1.0 million square feet, to Duke/Princeton, LLC, for an agreed value of $173.9 million for which our 80% share of net proceeds totaled $138.3 million.
We expect, and are under contract, to sell additional buildings to Duke/Princeton, LLC by the end of the second quarter 2011, subject to financing and other customary closing conditions. The total 2011 sale is expected to consist of 13 office
buildings, totaling over 2.0 million square feet, with an agreed upon value of $342.8 million, and is expected to generate proceeds of $274.2 million for the 80% portion that we sell.

Uses of Liquidity

Our principal uses of liquidity include the following:

•

accretive property investment;

•

leasing/capital costs;

•

dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;

•

long-term debt maturities;

•

repurchases of outstanding debt and preferred stock; and

•

other contractual obligations.

Property Investment

We evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based
upon market outlook, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity including the issuances of debt or equity securities as well
as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties. In light of current economic conditions, management continues to evaluate our investment priorities and is focused on accretive growth.

We have continued to operate at a substantially reduced level of new development activity, as compared to recent years, and are focused on the core
operations of our existing base of properties.

Leasing/Capital Costs

Tenant improvements and leasing costs to re-let rental space that had been previously under lease to tenants are referred to as second generation expenditures. Building improvements that are not specific
to any tenant but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties are also second generation expenditures.

One of our
principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments. The following is a summary of our second generation capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively (in thousands):

Dividends and Distributions

We are required to meet the distribution requirements of the Code, in order to maintain our REIT status. Because depreciation and impairments are non-cash expenses, cash flow will typically be greater
than operating income. We paid dividends per share of $0.68, $0.76 and $1.93 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings, to meet the
requirements to maintain our REIT status, and additional amounts as determined by our board of directors. Distributions are declared at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial
condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.

At December 31, 2010 we had six series
of preferred shares outstanding. The annual dividend rates on our preferred shares range between 6.5% and 8.375% and are paid in arrears quarterly.

- 41 -


Debt Maturities

Debt outstanding at December 31, 2010 had a face value totaling $4.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 6.24% maturing at various dates through 2028. We had $3.0 billion of unsecured
debt, $193.0 million outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit and $1.1 billion of secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2010. We made scheduled and unscheduled principal payments of $587.3 million on outstanding debt during the year
ended December 31, 2010.

The following is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at
December 31, 2010 (in thousands, except percentage data):

We anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from rental
operations and property dispositions, as well as by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions.

Repurchases of
Outstanding Debt and Preferred Stock

To the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy, we may purchase additional amounts
of our outstanding unsecured debt prior to its stated maturity or redeem or repurchase certain of our outstanding series of preferred stock.

Guarantee Obligations

We are
subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments.

We are, however, subject to a joint and several guarantee of the construction loan agreement of the 3630 Peachtree joint venture. A contingent liability in the amount of $36.3 million was established
in 2009 based on the probability of us being required to pay this obligation to the lender.

Historical Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents were $18.4 million and $147.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The following highlights significant
changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our Rental Operations and
Service Operations activities. The receipt of rental income from Rental Operations continues to provide the primary source of our revenues and operating cash

- 42 -


flows. In addition, we have historically developed Build-for-Sale properties with the intent to sell them at or soon after completion. As a result of the refinement to our strategy in 2009, we
have ceased new Build-for-Sale development activity to focus on completion of existing projects. Highlights of operating cash changes are as follows:

•

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred no Build-for-Sale property development costs, compared to $16.9 million and $216.1 million
for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease is a result of the planned elimination of our Build-for-Sale program.

•

We sold no Build-for-Sale properties in 2010 compared to three in 2009 and 14 in 2008, receiving net proceeds of $31.9 million and $343.0 million,
respectively. The 2009 sales were nearly break-even, while the 2008 sales resulted in pre-tax gains of $39.1 million.

•

Net cash flows from third-party construction contracts totaled a net outflow of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a
net outflow of $4.6 million and a net inflow of $125.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The higher operating cash flows in 2008 from third-party construction contracts were driven by $105.1 million in cash
proceeds from the 2008 sale of a parcel of land that was completed in conjunction with a significant third-party construction project.

Investing Activities

Investing activities are one of the primary uses of our
liquidity. Development and acquisition activities typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:

•

Development expenditures for our held-for-rental portfolio totaled $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $268.9 million
and $436.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease is consistent with our planned reduction in new development activity.

•

During 2010, we paid cash of $488.5 million for real estate acquisitions, compared to $31.7 million in 2009 and $20.1 million in 2008. In addition, we
paid cash of $14.4 million for undeveloped land in 2010, compared to $5.5 million in 2009 and $40.9 million in 2008.

•

Sales of land and depreciated property provided $499.5 million in net proceeds in 2010, compared to $256.3 million in 2009 and $116.6 million in 2008.

•

During 2010, we contributed or advanced $53.2 million to fund development activities within unconsolidated companies, compared to $23.5 million in 2009
and $132.2 million in 2008.

•

We received capital distributions (as a result of the sale of properties or refinancing) from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $22.1 million in 2010 and
$95.4 million in 2008. We received no such distributions from unconsolidated companies in 2009.

Financing Activities

The following items highlight significant capital transactions:

•

In January 2010, we repaid $99.8 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 5.37% on their scheduled maturity date. This
compares to repayments of $124.0 million of corporate unsecured debt and $82.1 million of senior unsecured notes with effective interest rates of 6.83% and 7.86%, respectively, on their scheduled maturity dates in February 2009 and November 2009,
respectively. We also repaid $125.0 million and $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes with effective interest rates of 3.36% and 6.76%, respectively, on their scheduled maturity dates in January 2008 and May 2008, respectively.

•

In April 2010, we issued $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at an effective rate of 6.75% and mature in March 2020. In August
2009, we issued $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2015 bearing interest at an effective rate of 7.50% and $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2019 bearing interest at an effective rate of 8.38%. We

- 43 -


also issued $325.0 million of senior unsecured notes in May 2008 with an effective interest rate of 7.36% due in 2013.

•

In June 2010, we issued 26.5 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $298.1 million. In April 2009, we issued 75.2 million shares
of common stock for net proceeds of $551.4 million. We had no common stock issuances in 2008.

•

During 2010, through a cash tender offer and open market transactions, we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to
mature in 2011 and 2013. In total, we paid $292.2 million for unsecured notes that had a face value of $279.9 million. Throughout 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes maturing in
2009 through 2011. In 2009, cash payments of $500.9 million were made to repurchase notes with a face value of $542.9 million, compared to cash payments of $36.5 million made in the fourth quarter of 2008 for notes with a face value of $38.5
million.

•

Throughout 2010, we completed open market repurchases of approximately 4.5 million shares of our 8.375% Series O preferred stock. We paid $118.8
million to repurchase these shares, which had a face value of $112.1 million. During the fourth quarter of 2008, in order to take advantage of the significant discounts at which they were trading, we opportunistically repurchased portions of all
outstanding series of our preferred shares, which had a total redemption value of approximately $27.4 million, in the open market for $12.4 million.

•

We increased net borrowings on DRLP’s $850.0 million line of credit by $175.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a
decrease of $474.0 million in 2009 and a decrease of $69.0 million in 2008.

•

We paid cash dividends of $0.68 per common share in 2010, compared to cash dividends of $0.76 per common share in 2009 and $1.93 per common share in
2008. In order to retain additional cash to help meet our capital needs, we reduced our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2009.

•

In February, March and July 2009, we received cash proceeds of $270.0 million from three 10-year secured debt financings that are secured by 32 rental
properties. The secured debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.69% and matures at various points in 2019.

•

In March 2008, we settled three forward-starting swaps and made a cash payment of $14.6 million to the counterparties.

•

In February 2008, we received net proceeds of approximately $290.0 million from the issuance of shares of our Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock; we had no new preferred equity issuances in 2009 or 2010.

Credit Ratings

We are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and
Poor’s Ratings Group. Our senior unsecured notes have been assigned ratings of BBB- and Baa2 by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s Investors Service, respectively.

Our preferred shares carry ratings of BB+ and Baa3 from Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s Investors Service, respectively.

The ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred shares could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and
financial condition.

- 44 -


Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time
to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in Unconsolidated Companies

We have equity interests in unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. Our unconsolidated subsidiaries are primarily engaged in
the operations and development of Industrial, Office and Medical Office real estate properties. The equity method of accounting (see Critical Accounting Policies) is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies. As a result, the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet.

Our investments in and advances to unconsolidated companies represent approximately 5% and 7% of our total assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These investments provide several
benefits to us, including increased market share, tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects.

The following table presents summarized financial information for unconsolidated companies for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

Dugan generated $42.5 million in
revenues and $6.4 million of net income in the six months of 2010 prior to its July 1 consolidation. Dugan generated $85.7 million of revenues and $12.5 million of net income during 2009, and had total assets of $649.3 million as of
December 31, 2009.

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (“special purpose
entities”) that have been established solely for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual
Obligations

At December 31, 2010, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below:

- 45 -


(1)

Our long-term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using
the interest rates as of December 31, 2010.

(2)

Our unsecured lines of credit consist of an operating line of credit that matures February 2013 and the line of credit of a consolidated subsidiary that matures July
2011. Interest expense for our unsecured lines of credit was calculated using the most recent stated interest rates that were in effect.

(3)

Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at
December 31, 2010.

(4)

Represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of owned development projects and third-party construction projects.

Related Party Transactions

We
provide property and asset management, leasing, construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, we earned
management fees of $7.6 million, $8.4 million and $7.8 million, leasing fees of $2.7 million, $4.2 million and $2.8 million and construction and development fees of $10.3 million, $10.2 million and $12.7 million from these companies. We recorded
these fees based on contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services, and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have guaranteed the repayment of $95.4 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial
developments. We will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be
required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

We also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured
loans of six of our unconsolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2010, the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately $245.4 million. With the exception of the guarantee of the debt of 3630 Peachtree joint venture, for which
we recorded a contingent liability in 2009 of $36.3 million, management believes it probable that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees.

We lease certain land positions with terms extending to December 2080, with a total obligation of $103.6 million. No payments on these ground leases are material in any individual year.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any
ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2009, we adopted a newly effective accounting standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion.
The new standard required separate accounting for the debt and equity components of certain convertible instruments. Our Exchangeable Notes issued in November 2006 have an exchange rate of 20.47 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the
notes, representing an exchange price of $48.85 per share of our common stock. The Exchangeable Notes

- 46 -


were subject to the accounting changes required by the new standard, which required that the value assigned to the debt component equal the estimated fair value of debt with similar contractual
cash flows, but without the conversion feature, resulting in the debt being recorded at a discount. The resulting debt discount will be amortized over the period from its issuance through November 2011, the first optional redemption date, as
additional non-cash interest expense.

At December 31, 2010, the Exchangeable Notes had $167.6 million of principal outstanding, with an
unamortized discount of $2.1 million and a net carrying amount of $165.6 million. The carrying amount of the equity component was $34.7 million at December 31, 2010. Subsequent to the implementation of the new standard, interest expense is
recognized on the Exchangeable Notes at an effective rate of 5.6%. The increase to interest expense (in thousands) on the Exchangeable Notes, which led to a corresponding decrease to net income, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008 is summarized as follows:

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard that became
effective on January 1, 2010. This accounting standard is a revision to a previous FASB interpretation and changes how a reporting entity evaluates whether an entity is a VIE and which entity is considered the primary beneficiary of a VIE and
is therefore required to consolidate such VIE. This accounting standard also requires assessments at each reporting period of which party within the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and requires a number of new disclosures related to
VIE’s. This new accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long-term borrowings. Our interest rate risk management objective
is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed rates. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for
speculative purposes. Our two outstanding swaps, which fixed the rates on two of our variable rate loans, were not significant to the Financial Statements in terms of notional amount or fair value at December 31, 2010.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts (in thousands) of the expected annual
maturities, weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period, fair values (in thousands) and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.

- 47 -


As the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2010, it does not consider those
exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time to the
extent we are party to interest rate derivatives, and interest rates. Interest expense on our unsecured lines of credit will be affected by fluctuations in LIBOR indices as well as changes in our credit rating.

At December 31, 2010, the par value of our unsecured debt was $3.0 billion and we estimated the fair value of that unsecured debt to be $3.2
billion. At December 31, 2009, the par value of our unsecured notes was $3.1 billion and our estimate of the fair value of that debt was $3.0 billion.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s Report on Internal Control

We, as management of Duke Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Duke”), are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the
company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control – Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.

The independent registered public accounting firm of KPMG LLP, as auditors of Duke’s consolidated financial statements, has also issued an audit report on Duke’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Shareholders and Directors of

Duke Realty
Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. In connection with our
audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule III. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s report on internal
control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010,
in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule III, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The Company

Substantially all of our Rental Operations (see Note 9) are conducted through Duke Realty Limited Partnership (“DRLP”). We
owned approximately 98.0% of the common partnership interests of DRLP (“Units”) at December 31, 2010. At the option of the holders, subject to certain restrictions, the remaining Units are redeemable for shares of our common stock on
a one-to-one basis and earn dividends at the same rate as shares of our common stock. If determined to be necessary in order to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), we may elect to purchase the Units for an
equivalent amount of cash rather than issuing shares of common stock upon redemption. We conduct our Service Operations (see Note 9) through Duke Realty Services, LLC, Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited
Partnership (“DCLP”). DCLP is owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Duke Realty Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) and those entities owned or
controlled by the Company.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

FASB Codification

On July 1, 2009, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC” or the “Codification”) that established the exclusive authoritative reference for accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“GAAP”) for use in financial statements, except for SEC rules and interpretive releases, which are also authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting
standards but did not impact any of our existing accounting policies.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. The equity
interests in these controlled subsidiaries not owned by us are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements. Investments in entities that we do not control, and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which we are not the primary beneficiary, are not consolidated and are reflected as investments in unconsolidated companies under the
equity method of reporting.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for 2009 and 2008 have been reclassified to conform to the 2010
consolidated financial statement presentation.

Real Estate Investments

Rental real property, including land, land improvements, buildings and tenant improvements, are included in real estate investments and
are generally stated at cost. Construction in process and undeveloped land are included in real estate investments and are stated at cost. Real estate investments also include our equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and
operate rental properties and hold land for development.

- 66 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Depreciation

Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated lives not to exceed 40 and 15 years,
respectively, for properties that we develop, and not to exceed 30 and 10 years, respectively, for acquired properties. Tenant improvement costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the term of the related lease.

Cost Capitalization

Direct and certain indirect costs clearly associated with the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. In addition, all leasing
commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized. We capitalize a portion of our indirect costs associated with our construction, development and leasing efforts. In assessing the amount of direct and indirect costs
to be capitalized, allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. We do not capitalize any costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects.

We capitalize direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In addition, we capitalize costs, including real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities, that have been allocated to vacant space based on the square footage of the portion of the building not
held available for immediate occupancy during the extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to
ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized.

We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods when significant activities have ceased, which does not exceed
the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.

Impairment

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held- for- sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may
not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise
as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions,
rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated
holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an
impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the
carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

- 67 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective,
especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing
long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash
flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset’s undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.

Real estate assets classified as held- for- sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated
costs to sell. Once a property is designated as held-for-sale, no further depreciation expense is recorded.

Purchase
Accounting

On January 1, 2009, we adopted the new accounting standard (FASB ASC 805) on purchase accounting, which
required acquisition related costs to be expensed immediately as period costs. This new standard also requires that (i) 100% of the assets and liabilities of an acquired entity, as opposed to the amount proportional to the portion acquired,
must be recorded at fair value upon an acquisition and (ii) a gain or loss must be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of any existing ownership interests in acquired entities. Finally, this new standard
requires that contingencies arising from a business combination be recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of
acquisition. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management’s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by
independent appraisers. Factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. The purchase price of real estate assets
is also allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and the value of customer relationships.

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value
(using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management’s estimate of the
amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other
liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

The
total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and to customer relationship values based upon management’s assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and
other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Joint Ventures

We have equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. We
consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are the primary beneficiary. We analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is considered a VIE and
would require consolidation. We (i) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity investment at risk, (ii) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group, and whether there are any
guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (iii) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this VIE
determination. We would consolidate a venture that is determined to be a VIE if we were the primary beneficiary.

On
January 1, 2010, we adopted a new accounting standard that eliminated the primarily quantitative model previously in effect to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE and replaced it with a qualitative model that focuses on which entities
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE as well as the obligation or rights to absorb the VIE’s losses or receive its benefits. This new standard requires assessments at each reporting period of which party within the VIE is
considered the primary beneficiary and also requires a number of new disclosures related to VIEs. The reconsideration of the initial determination of VIE status is still based on the occurrence of certain events. We were not the primary beneficiary
of any VIEs at January 1, 2010 and the implementation of this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition.

During 2010, events took place within two of our unconsolidated joint ventures that required us to re-evaluate our previous conclusions that these two joint ventures were not VIEs. Upon reconsideration,
we determined that the fair values of the equity investments at risk were not sufficient, when considering their overall capital requirements, and we therefore concluded that these two ventures now meet the applicable criteria to be considered VIEs.

These two joint ventures were formed with the sole purpose of developing, constructing, leasing, marketing and selling
properties for a profit. The majority of the business activities of these joint ventures are financed with third-party debt, with joint and several guarantees provided by the joint venture partners. All significant decisions for both joint ventures,
including those decisions that most significantly impact each venture’s economic performance, require unanimous joint venture partner approval as well as, in certain cases, lender approval. In both joint ventures, unanimous joint venture
partner approval requirements include entering into new leases, setting annual operating budgets, selling an underlying property, and incurring additional indebtedness. Because no single variable interest holder exercises control over the decisions
that most significantly affect each venture’s economic performance, we determined that the equity method of accounting is still appropriate for these joint ventures.

- 69 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following is a summary of the carrying value in our consolidated balance sheet, as well as our
maximum loss exposure under guarantees, for entities we have determined to be VIEs as of December 31, 2010:

Carrying Value

Maximum Loss

Exposure

Investment in Unconsolidated Company

$

31.7 million

$

31.7 million

Guarantee Obligations (1)

$

(25.2 million

)

$

(63.7 million

)

(1)

We are party to joint and several guarantees of the third-party debt of both of these joint ventures and our maximum loss exposure is equal to the maximum monetary
obligation pursuant to the guarantee agreements. In 2009, we recorded a liability for our probable future obligation under a guarantee to the lender of one of these ventures. Pursuant to an agreement with the lender, we may make member loans to this
joint venture that will reduce our maximum guarantee obligation on a dollar- for- dollar basis. The carrying value of our recorded guarantee obligations is included in other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

To the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as VIEs, we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority
ownership interests or where we are the managing member and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day-to-day operations, refinance debt and sell
the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner. We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over
operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not
included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint
venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of
the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. We recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner’s interest, to the extent the
economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

Cash Equivalents

Investments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Valuation of Receivables

We reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90 days. Additional reserves are recorded for more current amounts, as applicable,
where we have determined collectability to be doubtful. Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant with long-term risk, regardless of the status of current rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

Deferred Costs

Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related loan. All direct and indirect costs, including estimated internal costs, associated
with the leasing of real estate investments owned by us are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease. We include lease incentive costs, which are payments made on behalf of a tenant to sign a lease, in deferred leasing costs and
amortize them on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms as a reduction of rental revenues. We include as lease incentives amounts funded to construct tenant improvements owned by the tenant. Unamortized costs are charged to expense
upon the early termination of the lease or upon early payment of the financing.

Convertible Debt Accounting

On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard (FASB ASC 470) for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash
upon conversion. This new standard required separate accounting for the debt and equity components of certain convertible instruments. Our 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Exchangeable Notes”), issued in November 2006, have an exchange
rate of 20.47 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, representing an exchange price of $48.85 per share of our common stock. The Exchangeable Notes were subject to the accounting changes required by this new standard, which required
that the value assigned to the debt component equal the estimated fair value of debt with similar contractual cash flows, but without the conversion feature, resulting in the debt being recorded at a discount. The resulting debt discount will be
amortized over the period from its issuance through November 2011, the first optional redemption date, as additional non-cash interest expense. We were required to apply this new accounting standard retrospectively to prior periods.

At December 31, 2010, the Exchangeable Notes had $167.6 million of principal outstanding, an unamortized discount of $2.1 million
and a net carrying amount of $165.6 million. The carrying amount of the equity component was $34.7 million at December 31, 2010. Subsequent to the implementation of the new standard, interest expense is recognized on the Exchangeable Notes at
an effective rate of 5.6%. The increase to interest expense (in thousands) on the Exchangeable Notes, which led to a corresponding decrease to net income, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is summarized as follows:

Noncontrolling Interests

On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard (FASB ASC 810) on noncontrolling interests, which required noncontrolling
interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of total equity, resulting in retroactive changes to the presentation of the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of
operations. This new standard also modified the accounting for changes in the level of ownership in consolidated subsidiaries.

Noncontrolling interests relate to the minority ownership interests in DRLP and interests in consolidated property partnerships that are
not wholly owned. Noncontrolling interests are subsequently adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to noncontrolling holders and the noncontrolling holders’ proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective
entity.

Prior to January 1, 2009, when a Unit was redeemed (Note 1), the difference between the aggregate book value and
the purchase price of the Unit increased the recorded value of our net assets. For redemptions of Units subsequent to January 1, 2009, the change in ownership is treated as an equity transaction and there is no effect on our earnings or net
assets.

Revenue Recognition

Rental and Related Revenue

The timing of revenue recognition under an operating lease is determined based upon ownership of the tenant improvements. If we are the
owner of the tenant improvements, revenue recognition commences after the improvements are completed and the tenant takes possession or control of the space. In contrast, if we determine that the tenant allowances we are funding are lease
incentives, then we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant. Rental income from leases with free rental periods or scheduled rental increases during their terms is recognized on a
straight-line basis.

We record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us
and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any material conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us.

General Contractor and Service Fee Revenue

Management fees are based on a
percentage of rental receipts of properties managed and are recognized as the rental receipts are collected. Maintenance fees are based upon established hourly rates and are recognized as the services are performed. Construction management and
development fees represent fee-based third-party contracts and are recognized as earned based on the terms of the contract, which approximates the percentage of completion method.

We recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method. Using this
method, profits are recorded based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under the contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The
percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and
are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

Receivables on construction contracts were in an
over-billed position of $160,000 and $470,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Property Sales

Gains on sales of all properties are recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 360-20.

The specific timing of the sale of a building
is measured against various criteria in FASB ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance from the seller associated with the properties. We make judgments based
on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize considering factors such as continuing ownership interest we may have with the buyer (“partial sales”) and our level of
future involvement with the property or the buyer that acquires the assets. If the full accrual sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or
cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the full accrual sales criteria are met. Estimated future costs to be incurred after completion of each sale are included in the determination of the gain on sales.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

To the extent that a property has had operations prior to sale, and that we do not have continuing involvement with the property, gains from sales of depreciated property are included in discontinued
operations and the proceeds from the sale of these held-for-rental properties are classified in the investing activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Gains or losses from our sale of properties that were developed or repositioned with the intent to sell and not for long-term rental (“Build-for-Sale” properties) are classified as gain on sale
of properties in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Other rental properties that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations are also classified as gain on sale of properties in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share

Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, less dividends on
share-based awards expected to vest, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the sum of basic net income (loss) attributable to common
shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in earnings allocable to Units not owned by us (to the extent the Units are dilutive), by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, to the extent they are dilutive,
partnership Units outstanding, as well as any potential dilutive securities for the period.

During the first quarter of 2009,
we adopted a new accounting standard (FASB ASC 260-10) on participating securities, which we have applied retrospectively to prior period calculations of basic and diluted earnings per common share. Pursuant to this new standard, certain of our
share-based awards are considered participating securities because they earn dividend equivalents that are not forfeited even if the underlying award does not vest.

The following table reconciles the components of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share (in thousands):

Federal Income
Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To qualify as a
REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our adjusted taxable income to our stockholders. Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to
maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we are entitled to a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends we pay to shareholders. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we currently distribute to shareholders
an amount equal to or in excess of our taxable income. We are also generally subject to federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be
subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.

REIT
qualification reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of state and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a dividends paid deduction and are
subject to corporate federal, state and local income taxes. As a REIT, we may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes if we engage in certain types of transactions.

The following table reconciles our net income (loss) to taxable income (loss) before the dividends paid deduction for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

A summary of the tax characterization of the dividends paid for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 follows:

Refinements to our operating strategy in 2009 caused us to reduce our projections of taxable income in our
taxable REIT subsidiary. As the result of these changes in our projections, we determined that it was more likely than not that the taxable REIT subsidiary would not generate sufficient taxable income to realize any of its deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, a full valuation allowance was established for our deferred tax assets in 2009, which we have continued to maintain through December 31, 2010. Income taxes are not material to our operating results or financial position.

We received income tax refunds, net of federal and state income tax payments, of $19.7 million in 2010. We paid federal and
state income taxes of $800,000 and $3.5 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The taxable REIT subsidiaries have no significant net deferred income tax or unrecognized tax benefit items.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We periodically enter into certain interest rate protection agreements to effectively convert or cap floating rate debt to a fixed rate, and to hedge anticipated future financing transactions, both of
which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. Net amounts paid or received under these agreements are recognized as an adjustment to the interest expense of the corresponding debt. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.

If a derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative
is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective, while the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value is recognized in earnings. Gains and losses on our interest rate protection agreements are
subsequently included in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same periods in which the related interest payments being hedged are recognized in earnings.

We estimate the fair value of derivative instruments using standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and termination cost at each balance
sheet date. For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the
hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.

Fair Value Measurements

On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard (FASB ASC 820) that establishes a framework for measuring fair value of non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required or
permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis but only in certain circumstances, such as a business combination.

- 75 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are
categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities to which we have access.

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted
prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the
asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input
to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The most significant estimates, as discussed within our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, pertain to the
critical assumptions utilized in testing real estate assets for impairment as well as in estimating the fair value of real estate assets when an impairment event has taken place. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Significant Acquisitions and Dispositions

2010 Acquisition of Remaining Interest in Dugan Realty, L.L.C.

On
July 1, 2010, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 50% interest in Dugan Realty, L.L.C. (“Dugan”), a real estate joint venture that we had previously accounted for using the equity method, for a payment of $166.7 million.
Dugan held $28.1 million of cash at the time of acquisition, which resulted in a net cash outlay of $138.6 million. As the result of this transaction we obtained 100% of Dugan’s membership interests.

At the date of acquisition, Dugan owned 106 industrial buildings totaling 20.8 million square feet and 63 net acres of undeveloped
land located in Midwest and Southeast markets. Dugan had a secured loan with a face value of $195.4 million due in October 2010, which was repaid at its scheduled maturity date, and a secured loan with a face value of $87.6 million due in October
2012 (see Note 8). The acquisition was completed in order to pursue our strategy to increase our overall allocation to industrial real estate assets.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following table summarizes our allocation of the fair value of amounts recognized
for each major class of assets and liabilities (in thousands):

We previously
managed and performed other ancillary services for Dugan’s properties and, as a result, Dugan had no employees of its own and no separately recognizable brand identity. As such, we determined that the consideration paid to the seller, plus the
fair value of the incremental share of the assumed liabilities, represented the fair value of the additional interest in Dugan that we acquired, and that no goodwill or other non-real estate related intangible assets were required to be recognized
through the transaction. Accordingly, we also determined that the fair value of the acquired ownership interest in Dugan equaled the fair value of our existing ownership interest.

In conjunction with acquiring our partner’s ownership interest in Dugan, we derecognized a $50.0 million liability related to a put
option held by our partners. The put liability was originally recognized in October 2000, in connection with a sale of industrial properties and undeveloped land to Dugan, at which point our joint venture partner was given an option to put up to
$50.0 million of its interest in Dugan to us in exchange for our common stock or cash (at our option). Our gain on acquisition, considering the derecognition of the put liability, was calculated as follows (in thousands):

Since the
acquisition date, Dugan’s results of operations have been included in continuing operations in our consolidated financial statements and have generated $38.7 million of incremental rental revenue, $4.4 million of incremental rental expenses,
and $7.1 million of incremental real estate tax expense. We additionally have recognized $5.2 million of interest expense, subsequent to the acquisition date, related to Dugan’s two secured loans.

The above
acquisitions include the first tranche of a portfolio of primarily industrial properties in South Florida (the “Premier Portfolio”), which we purchased on December 30, 2010 for $281.7 million, including the assumption of secured debt
that had a face value of $155.7 million. The first tranche included 39 buildings totaling more than 3.4 million square feet, comprised of 38 industrial properties and one office property. We intend, and are under contract, to acquire another 17
buildings to complete the acquisition of the Premier Portfolio in early 2011. The acquisition of the Premier Portfolio includes an earn-out provision where we have agreed to pay the sellers 25% of any increase in the fair value of the properties
over an agreed-upon value, less our additional capital investments in the buildings, at the end of the five year period subsequent to the acquisition. At the time of acquisition, we estimated the fair value of this contingent payment to be
inconsequential and, as such, have not recorded any liability as part of purchase accounting. Any subsequent changes to this estimate will be recognized through future earnings. Overall purchase accounting allocations for the first tranche of the
Premier Portfolio are preliminary as of December 31, 2010.

2009 Consolidation of Retail Joint Ventures

Through March 31, 2009, we were a member in two retail real estate joint ventures with a retail developer. Both
entities were jointly controlled by us and our partner, through equal voting interests, and were accounted for as unconsolidated subsidiaries under the equity method. As of April 1, 2009, we had made combined equity contributions of $37.9
million to the two entities and we also had combined outstanding principal and accrued interest of $173.0 million on advances to the two entities.

We advanced $2.0 million to the two entities, who then distributed the $2.0 million to our partner in exchange for the redemption of our partner’s membership interests, effective April 1, 2009,
at which time we obtained 100% control of the voting interests of both entities. We entered into these transactions to gain control of these two entities because it allowed us to operate and potentially dispose of the entities in a manner that best
serves our capital needs.

In conjunction with the redemption of our partner’s membership interests, we entered a profits
interest agreement that entitles our former partner to additional payments should the combined sale of the two acquired entities, as well as the sale of another retail real estate joint venture that we and our partner still jointly control, result
in an aggregate profit. Aggregate profit on the sale of these three projects will be calculated by using a formula defined in the profits interest agreement. We have estimated that the fair value of the potential additional payment to our partner is
insignificant.

The fair values recognized from the real estate and related assets acquired were primarily determined using
the income approach. The most significant assumptions in the fair value estimates were the discount rates and the exit capitalization rates. The estimates of fair value were determined to have primarily relied upon Level 3 inputs.

We recognized a loss of $1.1 million upon acquisition, which represents the difference between the fair value of the recognized assets
and the carrying value of our pre-existing equity interest. The acquisition date fair value of the net recognized assets as compared to the acquisition date carrying value of our outstanding advances and accrued interest, as well as the acquisition

operating income.

Fair Value Measurements

The fair value estimates used in allocating the aggregate purchase price of each acquisition among the individual components of real estate assets and liabilities were determined primarily through
calculating the “as-if vacant” value of each building, using the income approach, and relied significantly upon internally determined assumptions. We have, thus, determined these estimates to have been primarily based upon Level 3 inputs,
which are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions. The most significant assumptions utilized in these estimates, for our 2010 acquisitions, are summarized as follows:

Land and Buildings

During 2009, we refined our operating strategy and one result of this change in strategy was the decision to dispose of approximately
1,800 acres of land, which had a total cost basis of $385.3 million, rather than holding them for future development. Our change in strategy for this land triggered the requirement to conduct an impairment analysis, which resulted in a determination
that a significant portion of the land was impaired. We recognized impairment charges on land of $136.6 million in 2009, primarily as the result of writing down the land that was identified for disposition, and determined to be impaired, to
fair value. As part of determining the fair value of the non-strategic land in connection with the impairment analysis, we considered estimates made by national and local independent real estate brokers who were familiar both with the land parcels
subject to evaluation as well as with conditions in the specific markets where the land was located. There were few, if any, recent and representative transactions in many of the markets where our non-strategic land was, or is still, located upon
which we could base our impairment analysis. In such instances, we considered older comparable transactions, while adjusting estimated values downward to reflect the troubled condition of the overall economy at the time, constraints on available
capital for potential buyers, and the resultant effect of both of these factors on real estate prices. In all cases, members of our senior management that were responsible for the individual markets where the non-strategic land was located and
members of the Company’s accounting and financial management team reviewed the broker’s estimates for factual accuracy and reasonableness. In almost all cases, our estimate of fair value was comparable to that estimated by the brokers;
however, we were ultimately responsible for all valuation estimates made in determining the extent of the impairment. Actual sales of our undeveloped land targeted for disposition could be at prices that differ significantly from our estimates and
additional impairments may be necessary in the future in the event market conditions deteriorate further. Our valuation estimates primarily relied upon Level 3 inputs, as defined earlier in this report.

During 2009, we also reviewed our existing portfolio of buildings and determined that several buildings, which had previously not been
actively marketed for disposal, were not strategic and would not be held as long-term investments. Additionally, at various times throughout the year, we determined it appropriate to re-evaluate certain other buildings that were in various stages of
the disposition process for impairment because new information was available that triggered further analysis. Impairment charges of $78.1 million were recognized for 28 office, industrial and retail buildings that were determined to be impaired,
either as the result of a refinement in management’s strategy or changes in market conditions. Of the 28 commercial buildings that were determined to be impaired during 2009, the Company utilized an income approach in determining the fair value
of 16 of the buildings and a market approach in determining the fair value of the other twelve buildings. The most significant assumptions, when using the income approach, included the discount rate as well as future exit capitalization rates,
occupancy levels, rental rates and capital expenditures. The twelve buildings to which the market approach was applied were in various stages of the selling process. The Company’s estimates of fair value for these twelve buildings were based
upon asset-specific purchase and sales contracts, letters of intent or otherwise agreed upon offer prices, with third parties. These negotiated prices were based upon, and comparable to, income approach calculations we completed as part of the
selling process. Ten of these twelve properties were sold subsequent to the recognition of the impairment charge. There were no material differences in the ultimate selling price of the buildings compared to the selling price used in measuring the
initial impairment charge. Fair value measurements for the buildings that were determined to be impaired relied primarily upon Level 3 inputs, as defined earlier in this report.

Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

We have an investment in an unconsolidated entity (the “3630 Peachtree joint venture”) whose sole activity is the development
and operation of the office component of a multi-use office and residential high-rise building located in the Buckhead sub-market of Atlanta. As the result of declines in rental rates and projected increases in capital costs, we analyzed our
investment during the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 and recognized an impairment charge to write off our $14.4 million investment, as we determined that an other-than-temporary decline in value had taken place. As a result of the
3630 Peachtree joint venture’s obligations to the lender in its construction loan agreement, the likelihood that our partner will be unable to contribute its share of the additional equity to fund the 3630 Peachtree joint venture’s future
capital costs, and ultimately the obligation stemming from our joint and several guarantee of the 3630 Peachtree joint venture loan, we recorded an additional liability of $36.3 million, and an equal charge to impairment expense, for our probable
future obligations to the lender. The estimates of fair value utilized in determining the aforementioned charges relied primarily on Level 3 inputs, as defined earlier in this report.

Due to credit issues with its most significant tenant, an inability to renew third-party financing on acceptable terms and an increase to
its projected capital expenditures, we analyzed an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (the “Park Creek joint venture”) during the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 to determine whether there was an other-than-temporary
decline in value. As a result of that analysis, we determined that an other-than-temporary decline in value had taken place and we wrote our investment in the Park Creek joint venture down to its fair value, thus recognizing a $5.8 million
impairment charge. We estimated the fair value of the Park Creek joint venture using the income approach and the most significant assumption in the estimate was the expected period of time in which we would hold our investment in the joint venture.
We concluded that the estimate of fair value relied primarily upon Level 3 inputs, as defined earlier in this report.

Other Real Estate Related Assets

We recognized $31.5 million of impairment charges on other real estate related assets during 2009. The impairment charges related primarily to reserving loans receivable from other real estate entities as
well as writing off previously deferred development costs.

Fixed Rate Secured Debt

As of December 31, 2010, our secured debt was collateralized by rental properties with a carrying value of $1.8 billion and by
letters of credit in the amount of $7.0 million.

The fair value of our fixed rate secured debt as of December 31, 2010
was $1.1 billion. Because our fixed rate secured debt is not actively traded in any marketplace, we used a discounted cash flow methodology to determine its fair value. Accordingly, we calculated fair value by applying an estimate of the current
market rate to discount the debt’s remaining contractual cash flows. Our estimate of a current market rate, which is the most significant input in the discounted cash flow calculation, is intended to replicate debt of similar maturity and
loan-to-value relationship. The estimated rates ranged from 4.80% to 6.70%, depending on the attributes of the specific loans. The current market rates we utilized were internally estimated; therefore, we have concluded that our determination of
fair value for our fixed rate secured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs, as defined earlier in this report.

On
July 1, 2010, we assumed two non-recourse secured loans associated with the acquisition of Dugan, which had acquisition-date fair values of $196.6 million and $88.8 million and face values of $195.4 million and $87.6 million. The $196.6 million
loan, which bore interest at a rate of 7.52%, was repaid at its maturity in October 2010 while the $88.8 million loan, which bears interest at 5.92%, matures in October 2012. Both loans were determined at acquisition to have a market interest rate
of 5.25%.

In December 2010, we assumed 14 secured loans which had an acquisition date fair value of $158.2 million and a face
value of $155.7 million, in conjunction with the acquisition of the Premier Portfolio. The loans carry a weighted average interest rate of 5.58% and a weighted remaining term of 3.4 years. The assumed loans were determined to have market interest
rates of 5.00%.

In conjunction with two other acquisitions, we assumed two loans, with a combined acquisition date fair value
of $36.4 million, in December 2010. These two loans had a combined face value of $35.8 million. The loans mature in May 2014 and October 2016 and were determined to have market interest rates of 5.25% and 5.12%.

In February, March and July 2009, we borrowed a total of $270.0 million from three 10-year fixed rate secured debt financings that are
secured by 32 rental properties. The secured debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.69% and matures at various points in 2019. Additionally, in June 2009, we borrowed $8.5 million from two 6.50% 10-year fixed rate mortgages due in 2019,
which are secured by two properties.

Fixed Rate Unsecured Debt

Gains and losses on repurchase are shown after the write off of applicable issuance costs and other accounting adjustments.

We took the following actions during 2010 and 2009 as it pertains to our fixed rate unsecured indebtedness:

•

In January 2010, we repaid $99.8 million of corporate unsecured debt, which had an effective interest rate of 5.37%, at its scheduled maturity date.

•

Throughout 2010, through a cash tender offer and open market transactions, we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of senior unsecured notes
scheduled to mature in 2011 and 2013 for $292.2 million. The total face value of these repurchases was $279.9 million. We recognized a loss of $16.3 million on the repurchases after writing off applicable issuance costs and other accounting
adjustments.

•

On April 1, 2010, we issued $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 6.75% and mature on March 15, 2020.

•

In conjunction with one of our acquisitions in 2010, we assumed a $22.4 million unsecured loan that matures in June 2020 and bears interest at an
effective rate of 6.26%. This loan was originated less than one year prior to the acquisition and we concluded that the loan’s fair value equaled its face value.

•

In February 2009, we repaid $124.0 million of 6.83% corporate unsecured debt at its scheduled maturity date.

•

Throughout 2009, we repurchased portions of various series of our senior unsecured notes with various scheduled maturity dates through December 2011,
both on the open market and through cash tender offers, for $500.9 million. The total face value of these repurchases was $542.9 million. We recognized a gain of $27.5 million on the repurchases after writing off applicable issuance costs and other
accounting adjustments. The aforementioned gains on repurchase were partially offset by a $6.8 million charge to write off fees paid for a cancelled secured debt transaction.

•

In August 2009, we issued $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes in two equal tranches. The first $250.0 million of the senior unsecured notes mature
in February 2015 and bear interest at an effective rate of 7.50%, while the other $250.0 million of the senior unsecured notes mature in August 2019 and bear interest at an effective rate of 8.38%.

•

In November 2009, we repaid $82.1 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 7.86% on their scheduled maturity date.

The fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $3.2
billion. We utilized broker estimates in estimating the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt. Our unsecured notes are thinly traded and, in many cases, the broker estimates were not based upon comparable transactions. The broker estimates
took into account any recent trades within the same series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, comparisons to recent trades of other series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, trades of fixed rate unsecured debt from companies with profiles similar to
ours, as well as overall economic conditions. We reviewed these broker estimates for reasonableness and accuracy, considering whether the estimates were based upon market participant assumptions within the principal and most advantageous market and
whether any observable inputs would be more preferable indicators of fair value to the broker estimates. We concluded that the broker estimates were representative of fair value. We have determined that our estimation of the fair value of our fixed
rate unsecured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs. The estimated trading values of our fixed rate unsecured debt, depending on the maturity and coupon rates, ranged from 101.00% to 117.30% of face value.

The indentures (and related supplemental indentures) governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial
ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2010.

The DRLP unsecured
line of credit has a borrowing capacity of $850.0 million with an interest rate on borrowings of LIBOR plus 2.75% (equal to 3.01% for borrowings as of December 31, 2010), and matures in February 2013. Subject to certain conditions, the terms
also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, for a total of up to $1.05 billion. This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line,
at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains
financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the DRLP unsecured line of credit
agreement). As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

The
consolidated subsidiary’s unsecured line of credit allows for borrowings up to $30.0 million at a rate of LIBOR plus .85% (equal to 1.11% for outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2010). This unsecured line of credit is used to fund
development activities within the consolidated subsidiary and matures in July 2011 with, at our option, a 12-month extension.

To the extent that there are outstanding borrowings, we utilize a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value of
our unsecured lines of credit. The net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate represents the difference between the book value and the
fair value. Our estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate, considering current market conditions and our specific credit profile, at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings. The current market rate of 2.91% that we
utilized was internally estimated; therefore, we have concluded that our determination of fair value for our unsecured lines of credit was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs, as defined earlier in this report.

Changes in Fair Value

As all of our fair value debt disclosures relied primarily on Level 3 inputs, the following table summarizes the book value and changes in the fair value of our debt for the year ended December 31,

Segment Reporting

We have three reportable operating segments, the first two of which consist of the ownership and rental of office and industrial real
estate investments. The operations of our office and industrial properties, along with our medical office and retail properties, are collectively referred to as “Rental Operations.” Our medical office and retail properties do not meet the
quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as reportable segments. The third reportable segment consists of providing various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development and
construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, as well as our Build-for-Sale operations (defined below), and is collectively referred to as “Service Operations.” Our reportable segments offer different products
or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise.

Gains on sale of properties developed or acquired with the intent to sell (“Build-for-Sale” properties), and whose operations
prior to sale are insignificant, are classified as part of the income of the Service Operations business segment. The periods of operation for Build-for-Sale properties prior to sale were of short duration. Build-for-Sale properties, which are no
longer part of our operating strategy, did not represent a significant component of our operations in 2010 or 2009.

Other
revenue consists of other operating revenues not identified with one of our operating segments. Interest expense and other non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual segments in determining our performance measure.

- 88 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance
measure referred to as Funds From Operations (“FFO”), which management believes is a useful indicator of our consolidated operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure
of a REIT. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined
in accordance with GAAP. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. Consolidated FFO attributable to common shareholders should not be considered as a substitute
for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that
was adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT. We do not allocate certain income and expenses (“Non-Segment Items” as shown in the table below) to our operating segments. Thus, the operational performance measure presented here on a
segment-level basis represents net earnings excluding depreciation expense, as well as excluding the Non-Segment Items not allocated, and is not meant to present FFO as defined by NAREIT.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets
diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use
historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate
assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of consolidated FFO attributable to common shareholders, combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of
operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding
real estate asset depreciation and amortization, investors and analysts are able to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity and assist in comparing these operating results between
periods or as compared to different companies.

Employee Benefit Plans

We maintain a 401(k) plan for full-time employees. We have historically made matching contributions up to an amount equal to three percent of the employee’s salary and may also make annual
discretionary contributions. We temporarily suspended the Company’s matching program beginning in July 2009; however, a discretionary contribution was made at the end of 2010. The total expense recognized for this plan was $1.3 million, $1.6
million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We make contributions to a contributory health and welfare plan as necessary to fund
claims not covered by employee contributions. The total expense we recognized related to this plan was $10.4 million, $11.2 million and $9.6 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These expense amounts include estimates based upon the
historical experience of claims incurred but not reported as of year-end.

(12)

Shareholders’ Equity

We periodically use the public equity markets to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental properties or to pay down debt. The proceeds of these offerings are contributed to DRLP in
exchange for an additional interest in DRLP.

In June 2010, we issued 26.5 million shares of common stock for net
proceeds of approximately $298.1 million. The proceeds from this offering were used for acquisitions, general corporate purposes and repurchases of preferred shares and fixed rate unsecured debt.

Throughout 2010, pursuant to the share repurchase plan approved by our board of directors, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our
8.375% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares. The preferred shares that we repurchased had a total face value of approximately $112.1 million, and were repurchased for $118.8 million. An adjustment of approximately $10.4 million, which
included a ratable portion of issuance costs, increased the net loss attributable to common shareholders. All shares repurchased were retired prior to December 31, 2010.

In April 2009, we issued 75.2 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $551.4 million. The proceeds from the issuance were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the DRLP unsecured line
of credit and for other general corporate purposes.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, pursuant to the share repurchase plan
approved by our board of directors, we repurchased 109,500 preferred shares from all of our outstanding series of preferred shares. The preferred shares repurchased had a total redemption value of approximately $27.4 million, and were repurchased
for $12.4 million. An adjustment of approximately $14.0 million, net of a ratable portion of issuance costs, increased income attributable to common shareholders. All shares repurchased were retired prior to December 31, 2008.

The following series of preferred shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands, except percentage data):

All series of
preferred shares require cumulative distributions and have no stated maturity date (although we may redeem all such preferred shares on or following their optional redemption dates at our option, in whole or in part).

Stock Based Compensation

We are authorized to issue up to 12.4 million shares of our common stock under our stock based employee and non-employee compensation plans.

Cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost from the exercise of stock options (excess tax
benefits) were not significant in any period presented.

Fixed Stock Option Plans

We had options outstanding under five fixed stock option plans as of December 31, 2010. Additional grants may be made under one of
those plans. Stock option awards granted under our stock based employee and non-employee compensation plans generally vest over five years at 20% per year and have contractual lives of ten years. Our most recent annual grant of stock options
was in February 2008. The exercise price for stock option grants is set at the fair value of our common stock on the day of grant.

On June 7, 2010, we completed a one-time stock option exchange program, which was approved by our shareholders at our annual meeting, to allow the majority of our employees to surrender for
cancellation their outstanding stock options in exchange for a lesser number of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) based on both the fair value of the options and the RSUs at the time of the exchange. As a result of the program,
4.4 million options were surrendered and cancelled and 1.2 million RSUs were granted.

The total compensation cost
for the new RSUs, which is equal to the unamortized compensation expense associated with the related eligible unvested options surrendered, will be recognized over the applicable vesting period of the new RSUs. As the fair value of the RSUs granted
was less than the fair value of the eligible options surrendered in exchange for the RSUs, each measured on June 7, 2010, there was no incremental expense recognized through the exchange program. The most significant assumption used in
estimating the fair value of the surrendered options was the assumption for expected volatility, which was 70%. The volatility assumption was made based on both historical experience and our best estimate of future volatility. The assumption for
dividend yield was 5% while the assumptions for expected term and risk-free rate varied based upon the remaining contractual lives of the surrendered options.

The following table summarizes transactions under our stock option plans as of December 31, 2010:

Although this amount changes continuously based upon the market prices of the stock, none of the exercisable options outstanding had any pre-tax intrinsic value as of
December 31, 2010.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Options granted in the year ended December 31, 2008 had a weighted average fair
value per option of $1.76. As of December 31, 2010, there was $47,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options granted under the plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of
1.8 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2008 was approximately $898,000. Compensation expense recognized for fixed stock option plans was $820,000, $2.6 million and $3.9 million for the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $2.6 million, $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively.

The fair values of the options were determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

The risk free
interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history of and our present expectation of future dividend payouts. Our computation
of expected volatility for the valuation of stock options granted in the year ended December 31, 2008 is based on historic, and our present expectation of future volatility over a period of time equal to the expected term. The expected life of
employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.

Restricted Stock Units

Under our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and our 2005 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan approved by our shareholders in April 2005, RSUs may be granted to non-employee directors, executive officers
and selected management employees. An RSU is economically equivalent to one share of our common stock. RSUs generally vest 20% per year over five years, have contractual lives of five years and are payable in shares of our common stock with a
new share of such common stock issued upon each RSU’s vesting. However, RSUs granted to existing non-employee directors vest 100% over one year, and have contractual lives of one year. Also, RSUs granted on June 7, 2010 in exchange for
stock options will vest, depending on the original terms of the surrendered options, in either June 2012 or June 2013. We recognize the value of the granted RSUs over this vesting period as expense.

The following table summarizes transactions for our RSUs, excluding dividend equivalents, for 2010:

Compensation cost recognized for RSUs totaled $9.0 million, $7.3 million and $4.9 million for the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

As of December 31, 2010, there was $12.6 million of total unrecognized compensation
expense related to nonvested RSUs granted under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.5 years.

(14)

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not
utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

In November 2007, we entered into forward
starting interest swaps with notional amounts appropriate to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2009. The forward starting swaps were appropriately designated and tested for effectiveness as cash flow hedges. In
March 2008, we settled the forward starting swaps and made a cash payment of $14.6 million to the counterparties. An effectiveness test was performed as of the settlement date and it was concluded that a highly effective cash flow hedge was still in
place for the expected debt offering. Of the amount paid in settlement, approximately $700,000 was immediately reclassified to interest expense, as the result of partial ineffectiveness calculated at the settlement date. The net amount of $13.9
million was recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) and is being recognized through interest expense over the life of the hedged debt offering, which took place in May 2008. The remaining unamortized amount included as a reduction
to accumulated OCI as of December 31, 2010 is $5.5 million.

In August 2005, we entered into $300.0 million of cash flow
hedges through forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2007. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any changes in fair value recorded in OCI. In conjunction with the
September 2007 issuance of $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes, we terminated these cash flow hedges as designated. The settlement amount received of $10.7 million is being recognized to earnings through a reduction of interest expense over the
term of the hedged cash flows. The remaining unamortized amount included as an increase to accumulated OCI as of December 31, 2010 is $7.2 million. The ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant.

The effectiveness of our hedges is evaluated throughout their lives using the hypothetical derivative method under which the change in
fair value of the actual swap designated as the hedging instrument is compared to the change in fair value of a hypothetical swap. We had no material interest rate derivatives, when considering both fair value and notional amount, at
December 31, 2010.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have guaranteed the repayment of $95.4 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We will be required to make payments
under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in
satisfaction of these guarantees.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of six of our
unconsolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2010, the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately $245.4 million. Included in our total guarantee exposure is a joint and several guarantee of the construction loan agreement of
the 3630 Peachtree joint venture. A contingent liability in the amount of $36.3 million was established in 2009 based on the probability of us being required to pay this obligation to the lender.

We lease certain land positions with terms extending to December 2080, with a total obligation of $103.6 million. No payments on
these ground leases are material in any individual year.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
