PART I

Item 1.  Business

Background

We
are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”),
which began operations upon completion of our initial public offering in February 1986.
In October 1993, we completed an additional common shares offering and
acquired the rental real estate and service businesses of Duke Associates,
whose operations began in 1972. As of December 31, 2007, our diversified
portfolio of 726 rental properties (including 38 properties comprising 10.0
million square feet under development) encompass more than 121.1 million
rentable square feet and are leased by a diverse and stable base of more than
3,400 tenants whose businesses include manufacturing, retailing, wholesale
trade, distribution, healthcare and professional services. We also own or
control approximately 7,700 acres of unencumbered land ready for development.

Through
our Service Operations, we provide, on a fee basis, leasing, property and asset
management, development, construction, build-to-suit and other tenant-related
services. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” for financial information. Our Rental Operations are
conducted through Duke Realty Limited Partnership (“DRLP”). In addition, we
conduct our Service Operations through Duke Realty Services LLC, Duke Realty
Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited Partnership.  In this Form 10-K Report, the terms
“we,” “us” and “our” refer to Duke Realty Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) and those entities owned or controlled by the Company.

Our
headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. In
addition, we have 21 regional offices located in Alexandria, Virginia; Atlanta,
Georgia; Austin, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio;
Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Nashville, Tennessee; Newport Beach, California; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix,
Arizona; Raleigh, North Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri; San Antonio, Texas;
Savannah, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; Tampa, Florida; and Weston, Florida. We
had approximately 1,400 employees as of December 31, 2007.

Business
Strategy

One of our primary business objectives is to increase Funds From
Operations (“FFO”) by (i) maintaining and increasing property occupancy
and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing
properties; (ii) developing and acquiring new properties for our Rental
Operations in our existing markets; (iii) expanding geographically by
acquiring and developing properties in new markets; (iv) using our
construction expertise to act as a general contractor in our existing markets
and other domestic markets on a fee basis; (v) developing and
repositioning properties in our existing markets and other markets which we
will sell through our Service Operations property sale program and (vi) providing
a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.

FFO is used by industry analysts and
investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT
like Duke. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted
by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT created FFO as
a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical
cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure developed
by NAREIT to compare the operating performance of REITs.  The most comparable GAAP measure is net
income (loss).  FFO should not be
considered as a substitute for net income or any other measures derived in
accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies.

Historical cost
accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since
real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market
conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation
of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost
accounting to be insufficient by


themselves.  FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP
net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and
gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus
certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization,
and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
ventures.

Management
believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP
presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among
the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more
meaningful.  Management believes FFO is a
useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance
(although FFO should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains
the primary measure of performance) because by excluding gains or losses
related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding
real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO provides a useful
comparison of the operating performance of our real estate between periods or
as compared to different companies.

As
a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing,
management, development and construction services which, coupled with our
significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing
business parks, should give us a competitive advantage both as a real estate
operator and in future development activities.

We
believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done
most effectively at regional or local levels. As a result, we intend to
continue our emphasis on increasing our market share and effective rents in the
primary markets where we own properties. We also expect to utilize
approximately 7,700 acres of unencumbered land and our many business
relationships with our more than 3,400 commercial tenants to expand our build-to-suit
business (development projects substantially pre-leased to a single tenant) and
to pursue other development and acquisition opportunities in our primary
markets. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market
supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on
the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further
capitalize on strong customer relationships to provide third-party construction
and build-for-sale services outside our primary markets and to expand into high
growth and seaport markets across the United States.

Our
strategy is to seek to develop and acquire primarily Class A commercial
properties located in markets with high growth potential for large national and
international companies and other quality regional and local firms. Our
industrial and suburban office development focuses on business parks and
mixed-use developments suitable for multiple projects on a single site where we
can create and control the business environment. These business parks and
mixed-use developments often include restaurants and other amenities, which we
believe will create an atmosphere that is particularly efficient and desirable.
As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or
provide to our industrial, office and healthcare customers not only well
located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as
build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion
flexibility.

All
of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties.
Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally
own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of
competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply and demand of
similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive
on our properties.

Financing Strategy

We
seek to maintain a well-balanced, conservative and flexible capital structure
by: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of debt; (ii) borrowing
primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt
less than 20%; (iii) pursuing current and future long-term debt financings
and refinancing on an unsecured basis;  (iv) maintaining
conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios; (v) generating
proceeds from the sale of non-strategic properties and (vi) issuing
perpetual preferred stock for 5-10% of our total capital structure.


Management
believes that these strategies have enabled and should continue to enable us to
favorably access capital markets for our long-term requirements such as debt
refinancing and financing development and acquisitions of additional rental
properties. In addition, as discussed under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we have a $1.3
billion unsecured line of credit available for short-term funding of
development and acquisition of additional rental properties. Further, we pursue
favorable opportunities to dispose of assets that no longer meet our long-term
investment criteria and recycle the proceeds into new investments that we
believe have excellent long-term growth prospects. Our debt to total market
capitalization ratio (total market capitalization is defined as the total
market value of all outstanding common and preferred shares and units of
limited partnership interest (“Units”) in DRLP plus outstanding indebtedness) at
December 31, 2007 was 48.4%. Our ratio of earnings to debt service and
ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2007
were 1.58x and 1.47x, respectively. In computing the ratio of earnings to debt
service, earnings have been calculated by adding interest expense (excluding
amortization of debt issuance costs) to income from continuing operations, less
preferred dividends, and minority interest in earnings of DRLP. Debt service
consists of interest expense and recurring principal amortization (excluding
maturities) and excludes amortization of debt issuance costs. In computing the
ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings have been calculated by adding
interest expense and minority interest in earnings from DRLP to income from continuing
operations. Fixed charges consist of interest costs, whether expensed or
capitalized, the interest component of rental expense and amortization of debt
issuance costs.

Corporate
Governance

Since
our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer operationally,
but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and
corporate governance. Our system of governance reinforces this commitment.
Summarized below are the highlights of our Corporate Governance initiatives.

Available Information and Exchange Certifications

In addition to this
Annual Report, we file quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and
other

information

with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All documents that are filed
with the SEC are available free of charge on our corporate website, which is
www.dukerealty.com. You may also read and copy any document filed at the public
reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
Please call the SEC at (800) SEC-0330 for further information about the public
reference facilities. These documents also may be accessed through the SEC’s
electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval system (“EDGAR”) via
electronic means, including the SEC’s home page on the Internet
(http://www.sec.gov). In addition, since some of our securities are listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, you may read SEC filings at the offices of the New
York Stock Exchange, 20 Broad Street, New York, New York 10005.

The New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”) requires that the Chief Executive Officer of each listed
company certify annually to the NYSE that he or she is not aware of any
violation by the company of NYSE corporate governance listing standards as of
the date of such certification. We submitted the certification of our Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, Dennis D. Oklak, with our 2007 Annual Written
Affirmation to the NYSE on May 16, 2007.

We included the
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and related rules, relating to the quality of the Company’s public disclosure,
in this report as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2.

Item
1A.  Risk Factors

In
addition to the other information contained in this Report, you should
carefully consider, in consultation with your legal, financial and other
professional advisors, the risks described below, as well as the risk factors
and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the
caption “Risk Factors” in evaluating us and our business before making a
decision regarding an investment in our securities.

The
risks contained in this Report are not the only risks faced by us. Additional
risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem to be immaterial,
also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations, business and prospects. The trading price of our securities
could decline due to the materialization of any of these risks, and our
shareholders may lose all or part of their investment.


This
Report also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a
result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described
herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the
section in this Report entitled “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.

If we were to cease to qualify as a REIT, we and our
shareholders would lose significant tax benefits.

We intend to continue to operate so as to
qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”). Qualification as a REIT provides significant tax advantages to us and
our shareholders. However, in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, we
must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and
complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and
administrative interpretations. Satisfaction of these requirements also depends
on various factual circumstances not entirely within our control. The fact that
we hold our assets

through an operating
partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the
REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our
REIT status. Although we believe that we can continue to operate so as to
qualify as a REIT, we cannot offer any assurance that we can continue to do so
or that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court
decisions will not significantly change the qualification requirements or the federal
income tax consequences of qualification. If we were to fail to qualify as a
REIT in any taxable year, it would have the following effects:

·

We
would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders and would be
subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum
tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

·

Unless
we were entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT;

·

Our
net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders would
decrease due to the additional tax liability for the year or years involved;
and

·

We
would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders in order
to qualify as a REIT.

As
such, failure to qualify as a REIT would likely have a significant adverse
effect on the value of our securities.

REIT distribution requirements limit the amount of cash we
will have available for other business purposes, including amounts that we need
to fund our future growth.

To
maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must annually
distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income,
excluding net capital gains. We intend to continue to make distributions to our
shareholders to comply with the 90% distribution requirement. However, this
requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital for use for other business
purposes. If we do not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the
distribution requirements, we may have to borrow funds or sell properties on
adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements. If we fail to
make a required distribution, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax developments could affect the
desirability of investing in us for individual taxpayers.

In
May 2003, federal legislation was enacted that reduced the maximum tax
rate for dividends payable to individual taxpayers generally from 38.6% to 15%
(from January 1, 2003 through 2008). However, dividends payable by REITs
are not eligible for this treatment, except in limited circumstances. Although


this
legislation did not have a direct adverse effect on the taxation of REITs or
dividends paid by REITs, the more favorable treatment for non-REIT dividends
could cause individual investors to consider investments in non-REIT
corporations as more attractive relative to an investment in us as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and investments in
REITs may change, which may result in the loss of our tax benefits of operating
as a REIT.

The
present U.S. federal income tax treatment of a REIT and an investment in a REIT
may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time.
Revisions in U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations of these laws
could adversely affect us and the tax consequences of an investment in our common
shares.

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to
shareholders could decrease as a result of factors outside of our control.

Our
business is subject to the risks incident to the ownership and operation of
commercial real estate, many of which involve circumstances not within our
control. Such risks include the following:

·

Changes in the general economic climate;

·

Increases in interest rates;

·

Local conditions such as oversupply of property or a
reduction in demand;

·

Competition for tenants;

·

Changes in market rental rates;

·

Oversupply or reduced demand for space in the areas
where our properties are located;

·

Delay or inability to collect rent from tenants who are
bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise unwilling or unable to pay;

·

Difficulty in leasing or re-leasing space quickly or on
favorable terms;

·

Costs associated with periodically renovating, repairing
and reletting rental space;

·

Our ability to provide adequate maintenance and
insurance on our properties;

·

Our ability to control variable operating costs;

·

Changes in government regulations;

·

Changes in interest rate levels;

·

The availability of financing on favorable terms; and

·

Potential liability

under,
and changes in, environmental, zoning, tax and other laws.

Further,
a significant portion of our costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and
maintenance costs and our debt service payments, are generally not reduced when
circumstances cause a decrease in cash flow from our properties.

Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from
properties decreases.

Our
financial results depend on leasing space in our real estate to tenants on
terms favorable to us. Our income and funds available for distribution to our
stockholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay
their rent or we are unable to lease properties on favorable terms. In
addition, if a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our
rights as landlord without delays and we may incur substantial legal costs.
Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and
maintenance costs, generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a
reduction in income from the investment.


Our real estate development activities are subject to risks
particular to development.

We intend to continue to
pursue development activities as opportunities arise. These development
activities generally require various government and other approvals. We may not
receive the necessary approvals. We are subject to the risks associated with
development activities. These risks include:

·

Unsuccessful development opportunities could result in
direct expenses to us;

·

Construction costs of a project may exceed original
estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally
estimated, or possibly unprofitable;

·

Time required to complete the construction of a project
or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally
anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity;

·

Occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not
be sufficient to make the project profitable; and

·

Favorable sources to fund our development activities may
not be available.

We are exposed to risks associated with entering new markets.

We
consider entering new markets from time to time. The construction and/or acquisition
of properties in new markets involves risks, including the risk that the
property will not perform as anticipated and the risk that any actual costs for
rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the
pre-construction or pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed
estimates. There is, and it is expected that there will continue to be,
significant competition for investment opportunities that meet our investment
criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition
activities, if necessary.

We may be unsuccessful in operating completed real estate
projects.

We
face the risk that the real estate projects we develop or acquire will not
perform in accordance with our expectations. This risk exists because of
factors such as the following:

·

Prices paid for acquired facilities are based upon a
series of market judgments; and

·

Costs of any improvements required to bring an acquired
facility up to standards to establish the market position intended for that
facility might exceed budgeted costs.

Further, we can give no assurance that
acquisition targets meeting our guidelines for quality and yield will be
available when we seek them.

Our use of joint ventures may
limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.

In appropriate circumstances, we intend to
develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities
when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. We currently have joint
ventures that are not consolidated with our financial statements.  Our participation in joint ventures is
subject to the risks that:

·

We
could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that
might affect our ability to develop or operate a property;

·

Our
joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the
appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties; and

·

Our
joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could
create conflict of interest issues.


We are exposed to the risks of defaults by tenants.

Any
of our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken
their financial condition. In the event of default or the insolvency of a
significant number of our tenants, we may experience a substantial loss of
rental revenue and/or delays in collecting rent and incur substantial costs in
enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection,
a court could allow the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our
income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant
number of our tenants became unable to meet their obligations to us, became
insolvent or declared bankruptcy.

We may be unable to renew leases or relet space.

When
our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not
be able to relet the space. Even if our tenants do renew or we are able to
relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of
renovations, if necessary) may be less favorable than current lease terms. If
we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space, or if the rental
rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than current
rates, then our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected,
especially if we were unable to lease a significant amount of the space vacated
by tenants in our properties.

Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We
maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our facilities, including property,
liability, fire, flood and extended coverage. We believe this coverage is of
the type and amount customarily obtained for real property. However, there are
certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as
earthquakes, hurricanes and floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be
uninsurable or not economically insurable. We use our discretion when
determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms
are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable
cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial
loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current
replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes
and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also may make it
unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been
damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds we
receive may not be adequate to restore our economic position in a property. If
an insured loss occurred, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated
profits and cash flow from a property, and we would continue to be obligated on
any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property.
Although we believe our insurance is with highly rated providers, we are also
subject to the risk that such providers may be unwilling or unable to pay our
claims when made.

Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.

From
time to time, we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any
recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown
liabilities.  As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based
upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to
settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations
and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might
include:

·

liabilities
for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

·

claims
by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the
properties;

·

liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

·

claims
for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others
indemnified by the former owners of the properties.


We could be exposed to significant environmental liabilities
as a result of conditions of which we currently are not aware.

As
an owner and operator of real property, we may be liable under various federal,
state and local laws for the costs of removal or remediation of certain
hazardous substances released on or in our property. Such laws often impose
liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was
responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. In addition, we could
have greater difficulty in selling real estate on which hazardous substances
were present or in obtaining borrowings using such real estate as collateral.
It is our general policy to have Phase I environmental audits performed for all
of our properties and land by qualified environmental consultants. These Phase
I environmental audits have not revealed any environmental liability that would
have a material adverse effect on our business. However, a Phase I
environmental audit does not involve invasive procedures such as soil sampling
or ground water analysis, and we cannot be sure that the Phase I environmental
audits did not fail to reveal a significant environmental liability or that a
prior owner did not create a material environmental condition on our properties
or land which has not yet been discovered. We could also incur environmental
liability as a result of future uses or conditions of such real estate or
changes in applicable environmental laws.

Certain of our officers hold units in our operating partnership
and may not have the same interests as our shareholders with regard to certain
tax matters.

Certain
of our officers own limited partnership units in our operating partnership,
Duke Realty Limited Partnership. Owners of limited partnership units may suffer
adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties, the
refinancing of debt related to those properties or in the event we are the
subject of a tender offer or merger. As such, owners of limited partnership
units, including certain of our officers, may have different objectives
regarding the appropriateness of the pricing and timing of these transactions.
Though we are the sole general partner of the operating partnership and have
the exclusive authority to sell all of our wholly-owned properties or to
refinance such properties, officers who hold limited partnership units may
influence us not to sell or refinance certain properties even if such sale may
be financially advantageous to our shareholders. Adverse tax consequences may also
influence the decisions of these officers in the event we are the subject of a
tender offer or merger.

Our use of debt financing could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition.

We
are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the
risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required principal and
interest payments and the risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing
indebtedness, or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as
the terms of our existing indebtedness. If our debt cannot be paid, refinanced
or extended, we may not be able to make distributions to shareholders at
expected levels or at all. Further, if prevailing interest rates or other
factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher interest rates or other
restrictive financial covenants upon the refinancing, then such refinancing
would adversely affect our cash flow and funds available for operation,
development and distribution. We are also subject to financial covenants under
our existing debt instruments. Should we fail to comply with the covenants in
our existing debt instruments, then we would not only be in breach under the
applicable debt instruments but we would also likely be unable to borrow any
further amounts under these instruments, which could adversely affect our
ability to fund operations. We also have incurred and may incur in the future
indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Thus, as market interest
rates increase, so will our debt expense, affecting our cash flow and our
ability to make distributions to shareholders.

Financial covenants under existing credit agreements could
limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.


The
terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we
comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as
maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance
coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and
breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments
governing the applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment
obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity
or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow
would be adversely affected.

Debt
financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to the
Company’s shareholders.

The Company’s ability to
execute its business strategy depends on its access to an appropriate blend of
debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured
and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred
equity. Debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, or on
favorable terms or at all.  If the
Company issues additional equity securities to finance developments and
acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of existing shareholders
could be diluted.

Our
stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in
substantial losses to our shareholders.

The
equity securities markets have from time to time experienced volatility,
creating highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The
market price of our capital stock could change in ways that may or may not be
related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and
financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may
fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors
that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the
price or trading volume of our common stock include recent uncertainty in the
markets, general market and economic conditions, as well as those factors
described in these “Risk Factors” and in other reports that we file with the
SEC.

Many of these factors are
beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price
of our securities. If the market price of our securities decline, then our
shareholders may be unable to resell their securities upon terms that are
attractive to them. We cannot assure that the market price of our securities
will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the
securities markets in general can experience considerable unexpected price and
volume fluctuations.

We may
issue debt and equity securities which are senior to our common stock and
preferred stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively
affect the value of our common and preferred stock.

In
the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into
debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by certain of our assets,
or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured
or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated
notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of our liquidation, our
lenders and holders of our debt securities would receive a distribution of our
available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock and
preferred stock. Our preferred stock has a preference over our common stock
with respect to distributions and upon liquidation, which could further limit
our ability to make distributions to our common shareholders. Any additional
preferred stock that we may issue may have a preference over our common stock
and existing series of preferred stock with respect to distributions and upon
liquidation.

Our
leverage strategy may require us to seek substantial amounts of commercial
credit and issue debt securities to support our asset growth. Because our
decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend
on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or
estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt
financings. Further, market conditions


could
require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in
the future. Thus, our shareholders will bear the risk of our future offerings
reducing the value of their shares of common stock and diluting their interest
in us. We may change this leverage strategy from time to time without
shareholder approval.

If we are unable to generate
sufficient capital and liquidity, then we may be unable to pursue future
development projects and other strategic growth initiatives.

To complete our ongoing and planned development
projects, and to pursue our other strategic 
growth initiatives, we must continue to generate sufficient capital and
liquidity to fund those activities. To generate that capital and liquidity, we
rely upon funds from our existing operations, as well as funds that we raise
through our capital raising activities. In the current economic environment,
REITs like ours have faced earnings pressures that have made it more difficult
to generate capital and liquidity from existing operations. In addition, due to
the recent crises in the credit and liquidity markets, it has become
increasingly difficult to raise capital and generate liquidity through the sale
of equity and/or debt securities on favorable terms, if at all. In the event
that we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our
short- and long-term needs, or if we are unable to generate capital and
liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, then we may be required to curtail
our proposed development projects, as well as our other strategic and growth
initiatives.

We are subject to certain provisions that could discourage
change-of-control transactions, which may reduce the likelihood of our
shareholders receiving a control premium for their shares.

Indiana
anti-takeover legislation and certain provisions in our governing documents, as
we discuss below, may discourage potential acquirers from pursuing a
change-of-control transaction with us. As a result, our shareholders may be
less likely to receive a control premium for their shares.

Unissued Preferred Stock.

Our
charter permits our board of directors to classify unissued preferred stock by
setting the rights and preferences of the shares at the time of issuance. This
power enables our board to adopt a shareholder rights plan, also known as a
poison pill. Although we have repealed our previously existing poison pill and
our current board of directors has adopted a policy not to issue preferred
stock as an anti-takeover measure, our board can change this policy at any
time. The adoption of a poison pill would discourage a potential bidder from
acquiring a significant position in the company without the approval of our
board.

Business-Combination Provisions of Indiana Law.

We
have not opted out of the business-combination provisions of the Indiana
Business Corporation Law. As a result, potential bidders may have to negotiate
with our board of directors before acquiring 10% of our stock. Without securing
board approval of the proposed business combination before crossing the 10%
ownership threshold, a bidder would not be permitted to complete a business
combination for five years after becoming a 10% shareholder. Even after the
five-year period, a business combination with the significant shareholder would
require a “fair price” as defined in the Indiana Business Corporation Law or
the approval of a majority of the disinterested shareholders.

Control-Share-Acquisition Provisions of Indiana Law.

We have not opted out of the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law
regarding acquisitions of control shares. Therefore, those who acquire a
significant block (at least 20%) of our shares may only vote a portion of their
shares unless our other shareholders vote to accord full voting rights to the
acquiring person. Moreover, if the other shareholders vote to give full voting
rights with respect to the control shares and the acquiring person has acquired
a majority of our outstanding shares, the other shareholders would be entitled
to special dissenters’ rights.


Supermajority Voting Provisions.

Our charter prohibits business combinations or significant disposition
transactions with a holder of 10% of our shares unless:

·

The holders of 80% of our outstanding shares of capital
stock approve the transaction;

·

The transaction has been approved by three-fourths of
those directors who served on the board before the shareholder became a 10%
owner; or

·

The significant shareholder

complies with the “fair price” provisions of our charter.

Among
the transactions with large shareholders requiring the supermajority
shareholder approval are dispositions of assets with a value greater than or
equal to $1,000,000 and business combinations.

Operating Partnership Provisions.

The limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership contains
provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, including a
requirement that holders of at least 90% of the outstanding partnership units
held by us and other unit holders approve:

·

Any voluntary sale, exchange, merger, consolidation or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Operating
Partnership in one or more transactions other than a disposition occurring upon
a financing or refinancing of the Operating Partnership;

·

Our merger, consolidation or other business combination
with another entity unless after the transaction substantially all of the
assets of the surviving entity are contributed to the Operating Partnership in
exchange for units;

·

Our transfer of our interests in the Operating
Partnership other than to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries; and

·

Any

reclassification

or recapitalization
or change of outstanding shares of our common stock other than certain changes in
par value, stock splits, stock dividends or combinations.

We are dependent on key personnel.

Our
executive officers and other senior officers have a significant role in the
success of our Company. Our ability to retain our management group or to attract
suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave our
Company is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The
loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in
their availability could adversely impact our financial condition and cash
flow. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital
markets.

Item 6.  Selected Financial

Data

The following sets
forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for
each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2007. The
following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and
Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this Form 10-K
(in thousands, except per share amounts):


(1) Includes
$147,309 of secured debt classified as liabilities of properties held for sale
at December 31, 2006.

(2) Funds
From Operations (“FFO”) is used by industry analysts and investors as a
supplemental operating  performance
measure of an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) like Duke. FFO is calculated
in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of
the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT
created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that
excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from net income
determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”).  FFO is a non-GAAP
financial measure developed by NAREIT to compare the operating performance of
REITs. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss).  FFO should not be considered as a substitute
for net income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may
not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with
GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes
predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen
or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have
considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that
use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP
net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and
gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus
certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization,
and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
ventures.

Management believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required
primary GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of
REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results
more meaningful. Management believes FFO is a useful measure for reviewing
comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO should be
reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of
performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of
previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset
depreciation and amortization, FFO provides a useful comparison of the
operating performance of our real estate between periods or as compared to
different companies.

See reconciliation of FFO to GAAP net income under Year in Review
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations
through a related entity in 1972. As of December 31, 2007, we:

·

Owned or jointly
controlled 726 industrial, office, healthcare and retail properties (including
properties under development), consisting of more than 121.1 million square
feet; and

·

Owned or jointly
controlled approximately 7,700 acres of unencumbered land with an estimated
future development potential of more than 113 million square feet of
industrial, office, healthcare and retail properties.

We provide the following services for our properties and for certain
properties owned by third parties and joint ventures:

·

Property leasing;

·

Property management;

·

Asset management;

·

Construction;

·

Development; and

·

Other tenant-related services.


Management Philosophy and Priorities

Our key business and financial strategies for the future include the
following:

·

One of our primary
business objectives is to increase Funds From Operations (“FFO”) by (i) maintaining
and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the management of
our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) developing and acquiring new
properties for rental operations in our existing markets; (iii) expanding
geographically by acquiring and developing properties in new markets; (iv) using
our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction
manager in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis; (v) developing
and repositioning properties in our existing markets and other markets which we
will sell through our Service Operations property sale program; and (vi) providing
a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.

·

Our financing strategy is to actively
manage the components of our capital structure including common and preferred
equity and debt to maintain a conservatively leveraged balance sheet and
investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. Additionally, we
employ a capital recycling program where we utilize sales of operating real
estate assets that no longer fit our strategies to generate proceeds that can be
recycled into new properties that better fit our current and longer term
strategies.  This strategy provides us
with the financial flexibility to fund both development and acquisition
opportunities.

We seek to maintain a
well-balanced, conservative and flexible capital structure by: (i) extending
and sequencing the maturity dates of debt; (ii) borrowing primarily at
fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than 20%;
(iii) pursuing current and future long-term debt financings and
refinancing generally on an unsecured basis; 
(iv) maintaining conservative debt service and fixed charge
coverage ratios; (v) generating proceeds from the sale of non-strategic
properties and (vi) issuing perpetual preferred stock for 5-10% of our
total capital structure.

Year in Review

During 2007, we continued the
execution of our strategy to improve our portfolio of held for investment
buildings through our capital recycling program, increasing our development
pipeline to over $1.9 billion, and continuing geographic expansion that we
anticipate will provide future earnings growth. As a result of these
accomplishments, we achieved steady operating results while maintaining a
strong balance sheet.

Net income available for common shareholders for the year ended December 31,
2007, was $217.7 million, or $1.55 per share (diluted), compared to net income
of $145.1 million, or $1.07 per share (diluted) for the year ended 2006. FFO
available to common shareholders totaled $384.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2007, compared to $338.0 million for the same period in 2006.  Industry analysts and investors use FFO as a
supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment
trust (“REIT”). FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was
adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income
(loss) determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and
gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus
certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization,
and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
ventures.


Historical cost
accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since
real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market
conditions, many industry

analysts

and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate
companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.
Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating
performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from
GAAP net income. Management believes that the use of FFO, combined with the
required primary GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating
results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT
operating results more meaningful. Management believes FFO is a useful measure
for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO
should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary
measure of performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to sales
of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset
depreciation and amortization, FFO provides a useful comparison of the
operating performance of our real estate between periods or as compared to
different companies.

The following table summarizes the calculation of FFO for the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively (in thousands):

We continued strategic initiatives to expand geographically, recycle
capital from the disposition of operating properties, and create value by
leveraging our development, construction and management capabilities as
follows:

·

As part of our continuing strategy to expand into new
markets, we entered the Southern California, Seattle and Eastern Virginia
markets in 2007. This follows our geographic expansion initiatives in 2006 into
the Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Phoenix and Houston markets.

·

Throughout 2007, we completed
land acquisitions totaling $321.3 million while generating proceeds of $161.5
million from the disposition of other land parcels. Of our total undeveloped
land inventory, $108.1 million was placed under development during 2007 as
construction activity commenced.

·

In February 2007, we continued our expansion into
the health care real estate market by completing the acquisition of Bremner
Healthcare Real Estate (“Bremner”), a national health care development and
management firm. The initial consideration paid to the sellers totaled $47.1
million, and the sellers may be eligible for further contingent payments over
the next three years.

·

We disposed of 32 non-strategic wholly owned held for
rental properties for $336.7 million of gross proceeds.  Additionally, unconsolidated subsidiaries
disposed of 10 properties of which our share of the gross proceeds totaled
$30.1 million.  These transactions were a
continuation of our long-term strategy of recycling assets into higher yielding
new developments.

·

We disposed of 15 properties, which were developed
with the intent to sell, for $256.6 million of gross proceeds and recognized
pre-tax gains on sale of $34.7 million.


·

We will continue to
develop long-term assets to be held in our portfolio and develop assets to be
sold upon, or soon after, completion. With over $1.9 billion (which includes
$182.6 million of third-party construction backlog) in our development pipeline
at December 31, 2007, we are encouraged about the long-term growth
opportunities in our business.  Newly
developed properties, with a basis of $593.1 million and occupancy of 59.7% at December 31,
2007, were placed in service during the year.

·

We achieved record
leasing activity in 2007 with approximately 22.5 million square feet of new
leases and approximately 12.0 million square feet of lease renewals.

·

We have continued
to maintain a high occupancy level during this year of portfolio expansion as
the overall occupancy percentage of 92.7% on our in-service held for rental
portfolio was consistent with the 2006 level of 92.8%.

Highlights of our key financing activities in 2007 are as follows:

·

We had $546.1 million outstanding on our lines of
credit as of December 31, 2007. 
During 2007, the borrowing capacity on our line of credit was increased
from $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion while maintaining the interest rate of LIBOR
plus 52.5 basis points.

·

We issued $300.0 million of unsecured notes at an effective
interest rate of 6.16%.  We retired
$200.0 million of unsecured notes with a weighted average effective interest
rate of 5.55%.

·

In October 2007, we issued 7.0 million shares of
our common stock for net proceeds of $232.7 million.

·

In October 2007, we redeemed all of the
outstanding shares of our 7.99% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock at a liquidation amount of $132.3 million.

·

We continue to maintain a
conservative balance sheet and investment grade debt ratings from Moody’s Investors
Service (Baa1) and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (BBB+). Our debt to
total market capitalization ratio (total market capitalization is defined as
the total market value of all outstanding common and preferred shares and units
of limited partner interest in our operating partnership plus outstanding
indebtedness) was 48.4% at December 31, 2007 compared to 37.4% at December 31,
2006.

Key Performance Indicators

Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our
industrial, office, and healthcare properties (“Rental Operations”). The
following discussion highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider
critical for future revenue growth. All square footage totals and occupancy
percentages reflect both wholly-owned properties and properties in joint
ventures.

Occupancy Analysis:

As discussed
above, our ability to maintain favorable occupancy rates is a principal driver
of our results of operations. The following table sets forth occupancy
information regarding our in-service portfolio of rental properties (excluding
in-service properties developed or acquired with the intent to sell — “Service
Operations Buildings”) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively  (in thousands, except percentage data):


Lease Expiration and Renewals:

Our ability to
maintain and grow occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability
to re-lease expiring space. The following table reflects our in-service
portfolio lease expiration schedule by property type as of December 31,
2007. The table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents
(based on December 2007 rental revenue) under expiring leases (in
thousands, except percentage data):

Note:  Excludes buildings that are in the held for
sale portfolio.

We renewed 79.7% and 79.9% of our leases up for
renewal totaling approximately 9.8 million and 7.5 million square feet in 2007
and 2006, respectively. We attained 5.81% growth in net effective rents on
these renewals during 2007.  Our lease
renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively
consistent at a 70-80% success rate. We do not presently expect this renewal
percentage in 2008 to differ from the past three years.

Development:

Another source of growth
in earnings is the development of additional properties. These properties
should provide future earnings through income upon sale or from Rental
Operations income as they are placed in service. We had 16.6 million square
feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion
of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to 10.6 million square feet
and total costs of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006. We have increased
our development pipeline during 2007 and will continue to pursue additional
development opportunities, while focusing on pre-leasing as we closely monitor
the strength of the national and local market economies.

The following table summarizes our properties under
development as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands, except percentage
data):


Acquisition and Disposition Activity:

We continued to selectively dispose of non-strategic properties in
2007.  Gross sales proceeds related to
the dispositions of wholly owned held for rental properties were $336.7
million, which included the disposition of a portfolio of eight office
properties in the Cleveland market and a portfolio of twelve industrial
properties in the St. Louis market.  Our
share of proceeds from sales of properties within unconsolidated joint
ventures, in which we have less than a 100% interest, totaled $30.1
million.  In 2006, proceeds totaled
$139.9 million for the disposition of wholly owned held for rental properties
and $91.9 million for our share of property sales from unconsolidated joint
ventures.  Dispositions of wholly owned
properties developed for sale rather than rental resulted in $256.6 million in
proceeds in 2007 compared to $188.6 million in 2006.  We intend to continue to identify properties
for disposition in order to recycle the proceeds into higher yielding assets.
The level of 2008 dispositions will be impacted by the ability of the
prospective buyers to obtain favorable financing given the current state of the
capital markets.

In 2007, in addition to the acquisition of
Bremner, we acquired $117.0 million of income producing properties and $321.3
million of undeveloped land compared to $948.4 million of income producing
properties and $436.7 million of undeveloped land in 2006.

Results of Operations

A summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, is as follows
(in thousands, except number of properties and per share data):

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2007 to Year Ended December 31,

Rental Revenue from Continuing Operations

Overall, rental revenue from continuing operations
increased from $743.5 million in 2006 to $794.5 million in 2007. The following
table reconciles rental revenue from continuing operations by reportable
segment to our total reported rental revenue from continuing operations for the
years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively (in thousands):

Both of our reportable segments that comprise Rental
Operations (office and industrial) are within the real estate industry;
however, the same economic and industry conditions do not affect each segment
in the same manner. The primary causes of the increase in rental revenue from
continuing operations, with specific references to a particular segment when
applicable, are summarized below:


·

In 2007, we acquired six new properties and placed
38 development projects in-service. These acquisitions and developments
provided incremental revenues of $2.9 million and $16.6 million, respectively.

·

Acquisitions and developments that were placed in
service in 2006 provided $12.4 million and $25.1 million, respectively, of
incremental revenue in 2007.

·

We acquired an additional 31 properties in 2006 and
later contributed them to an unconsolidated joint venture, resulting in a $40.2
million reduction in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, as
compared to the same period in 2006.  Of
these properties, 23 were contributed in the fourth quarter of 2006, seven were
contributed in the second quarter of 2007 and one was contributed in the fourth
quarter of 2007.

·

Rental revenue includes lease termination fees.  Lease termination fees relate to specific
tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of
the contractual lease term. Lease termination fees increased from $16.1 million
in 2006 to $24.2 million in 2007.

·

The remaining increase in rental revenues is
primarily the result of an $18.2 million increase in revenues from reimbursable
rental expenses.  This increase is
largely offset by a corresponding increase in overall rental expenses.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of
net income from investments in unconsolidated companies. These joint ventures
generally own and operate rental properties and develop properties.  These earnings decreased from $38.0 million
in 2006 to $29.4 million in 2007. During 2006, our joint ventures sold 22
non-strategic buildings, with our share of the net gain recorded through equity
in earnings totaling $18.8 million, compared to ten joint venture building
sales in 2007, with $8.0 million recorded to equity in earnings for our share
of the net gains.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by
reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations
for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively (in
thousands):

Of
the overall $7.6 million increase in rental expenses in 2007 compared to 2006,
$9.9 million was attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in
service from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007.  This increase was largely offset by a
reduction in rental expenses of $7.6 million resulting from the contribution of
31 properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in 2006 and 2007.  Inclement weather conditions in the first
quarter of 2007, an increase in utility rates and volume in the third quarter
of 2007 due to unseasonably high temperatures and normal inflationary factors
triggered the remaining increase in rental expenses.


Of
the overall $14.4 million increase in real estate taxes in 2007 compared to
2006, $7.7 million was attributable to properties acquired and developments
placed in service from January 1, 2006 through December 31,
2007.  The remaining increase in real estate
taxes was driven by increases in assessments in some of our markets.

Interest Expense

Interest expense
from continuing operations remained fairly consistent from 2006 to 2007 at
$170.5 million in 2006, compared to $168.4 million in 2007.  While we maintained higher outstanding
borrowings in 2007 compared to 2006, these higher borrowings were used to fund
our increase in development activities and thus, the increased interest costs
from these borrowings were capitalized into project costs rather than expensed.

Depreciation and
Amortization Expense

Depreciation and
amortization increased from $232.7 million in 2006 to $271.6 million in 2007
due to increases in our held-for-rental asset base from acquisitions and
developments placed in service during 2006 and 2007.

Service Operations

Service Operations
primarily consist of sales of properties developed or acquired with the intent
to sell within a short period of time and the leasing, management, construction
and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by
third parties.  Leasing and management
fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services
rely on the expansion of business operations of third party property owners.
Earnings from Service Operations decreased slightly from $53.2 million in 2006
to $52.0 million in 2007.  The following
are the factors related to the decrease in earnings from Service Operations in
2007:

·

Our Service Operations building
development and sales program, whereby a building is developed or repositioned
by us and then sold soon after completion, is a significant component of
earnings from operations and is often a significant driver of fluctuations in
earnings from Service Operations between periods. During 2007, we generated
pre-tax gains of $34.7 million from the sale of 15 properties compared to $44.6
million from the sale of nine properties in 2006. Partially offsetting the
aforementioned decrease was a $2.9 million reduction in income taxes on these
gains on sale, with the net effect of decreased gains on sale in 2007 resulting
in a $7.0 million decrease in earnings from Service Operations.

·

Increased net general contractor revenues
drove a $9.7 million increase in earnings from Service Operations from 2006 as
the result of increased volume and margins and favorable settlement of
previously existing warranty reserves.

General and
Administrative Expense

General and
administrative expense increased from $35.8 million in 2006 to $37.7 million in
2007. General and administrative expenses are comprised of two components. The
first component is direct expenses that are not attributable to specific assets
such as legal fees, audit fees, marketing costs, investor relations expenses
and other corporate overhead. The second component is the unallocated indirect
costs determined to be unrelated to the operation of our owned properties and
Service Operations. Those indirect costs not allocated to these operations are
charged to general and administrative expenses. There was a $31.7 million
increase in the overall pool of overhead costs in 2007 that was necessitated by
our overall growth. The majority of this increase in the overall pool of
overhead costs was necessary as the result of increased rental and service
operations activity and thus, was allocated to rental operations, construction,
development and leasing. Approximately $1.5 million of the aforementioned
increase in the overall overhead pool was not allocated to operations, which
was the primary reason for the overall $1.9 million increase to general and
administrative expense.


Discontinued
Operations

The results of operations
for properties sold during the year or designated as held-for-sale at the end
of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations. The
property specific components of net earnings that are classified as
discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate
taxes, allocated interest expense, depreciation expense and minority interest,
as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties.

We classified the
operations of 302 properties as discontinued operations as of December 31,
2007. These 302 properties consist of 253 industrial, 48 office and one retail
property. As a result, we classified net income from operations, net of
minority interest, of $6.7 million, $10.7 million and $18.6 million as net
income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

Of these properties, 32
were sold during 2007, 21 properties were sold during 2006, 234 properties were
sold during 2005, and 15 operating properties are classified as held-for-sale
at December 31, 2007. The gains on disposal of these properties, net of
impairment adjustment and minority interest, of $113.6 million, $42.1 million
and $204.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, are also reported in discontinued operations.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2006 to Year Ended December 31,

Rental Revenue from Continuing Operations

Overall, rental revenue from continuing operations
increased from $602.1 million in 2005 to $743.5 million in 2006. The following
table reconciles rental revenue from continuing operations by reportable
segment to total reported rental revenue from continuing operations for the
years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively (in thousands):

Both of our reportable segments that comprise Rental
Operations (office and industrial) are within the real estate industry;
however, the same economic and industry conditions do not affect each segment
in the same manner. The primary causes of the increase in rental revenue from
continuing operations, with specific references to a particular segment when
applicable, are summarized below:

·

In 2006, we acquired 50 new properties and placed 27
development projects in-service. These 2006 acquisitions and developments are
the primary factor in the overall increase in rental revenue for the year ended
2006 compared to 2005 as they provided incremental revenues of $73.8 million
and $9.3 million respectively. These acquisitions totaled $948.4 million on 8.6
million square feet and were 99% leased at December 31, 2006.

·

Acquisitions and developments that were placed in
service in 2005 provided $15.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of
incremental revenue in 2006.

·

Rental revenue includes lease termination fees.  Lease termination fees relate to specific
tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of
the contractual lease term. Lease termination fees increased from $7.3 million
in 2005 to $16.1 million in 2006.

·

Our in-service occupancy increased from 92.7% at December 31,
2005, to 92.9% at December 31, 2006 and contributed to the remaining
increase in rental revenue.


Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of
net income from investments in unconsolidated companies. These joint ventures
generally own and operate rental properties and develop properties.  These earnings increased from $29.5 million
in 2005 to $38.0 million in 2006. During 2006, our joint ventures sold 22 non-strategic
buildings, with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings
totaling $18.8 million.  During the
second quarter of 2005, one of our ventures sold three buildings, with our
share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling $11.1
million.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by
reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations
for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively (in
thousands):

Rental
expenses and real estate taxes for 2006 have increased from 2005 by $30.2
million and $10.9 million, respectively, as the result of acquisition and
development activity in 2005 and 2006 as well as from an increase in occupancy
over the past two years.

Interest Expense

Interest expense
increased from $106.0 million in 2005 to $170.5 million in 2006, as a result of
the following:

·

Interest costs on the unsecured line of
credit increased by $29.2 million from 2005 as the result of increased
borrowings throughout the year, as well as increased interest rates.

·

Interest costs on unsecured notes
increased by $10.2 million as the result of an overall increase in borrowings
used mainly to fund acquisitions and development.

·

Interest costs on secured debt increased
by $27.8 million as the result of the increase in borrowings in 2006.

·

Offsetting the above increases,
capitalized interest increased by $26.8 million as the result of increased
development activities.

Depreciation and
Amortization Expense

Depreciation and
amortization increased from $203.1 million in 2005 to $232.7 million in 2006 as
the result of increases in our held-for-rental asset base from acquisitions and
developments placed in service during 2005 and 2006.


Service Operations

Service Operations
primarily consist of sales of properties developed or acquired with the intent
to sell within a short period of time and the leasing, management, construction
and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by
third parties. Leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while
construction and development services rely on the expansion of business
operations of third party property owners. Earnings from Service Operations
increased from $44.3 million in 2005 to $53.2 million in 2006. The following
are the factors related to the increase in earnings from Service Operations in
2006.

·

Our Service Operations building
development and sales program, whereby a building is developed or repositioned
by us and then sold soon after completion, is a significant component of
earnings from operations and is often a significant driver of fluctuations in
earnings from Service Operations between periods. During 2006, we generated
pre-tax gains of $44.6 million from the sale of nine properties compared to
$29.9 million from the sale of ten properties in 2005. Profit margins on these
types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property
being sold, the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale, such
as a pre-contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the
open market.

·

Partially offsetting the increased 2006
gains from our Service Operations building development and sales program was
the effect of a decreased focus on third-party construction services as well as
the fact that in the first quarter of 2005, we recognized $2.7 million of a
non-recurring deferred gain associated with the sale of our landscaping
operations in 2001.

General and
Administrative Expense

General and
administrative expense increased from $31.0 million in 2005 to $35.8 million in
2006. General and administrative expenses are comprised of two components. The
first component is direct expenses that are not attributable to specific assets
such as legal fees, audit fees, marketing costs, investor relations expenses
and other corporate overhead. The second component is the unallocated indirect
costs determined to be unrelated to the operation of our owned properties and
Service Operations. Those indirect costs not allocated to these operations are
charged to general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and
administrative expenses from 2005 was largely attributable to an increase in
our overall pool of overhead costs to support our current and anticipated
future growth.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The preparation of our
consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are
inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions,
and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and
experience. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further
discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed
the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and
discussed them with our Audit Committee and independent auditors. The following
accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the
financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported
amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:


Accounting
for Joint Ventures:

We
analyze our investments in joint ventures under Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,

to determine if the joint venture is
considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation. To the
extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities, we
further assess under the guidelines of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a
General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited
Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF
04-5”); Statement of Position 78-9,

Accounting
for Investments in Real Estate Ventures

(“SOP 78-9”);

Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

;

and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (“SFAS”) No. 94,

Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries,

to determine if the venture should be consolidated. We have equity
interests generally ranging from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated joint ventures
that develop, own and operate rental properties and hold land for development.
We consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be variable interest
entities where we are the primary beneficiary. 
For non-variable interest entities, we consolidate those joint ventures
that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing
member and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control
is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage
day-to-day operations, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture
without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner
to replace the general partner. We use the equity method of accounting for
those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial
polices. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint
venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities
of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on
our balance sheet.

To the extent that
we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in joint venture is
recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint
venture.  To the extent that our cost
basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the
basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included
in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture.  In accordance with the provisions of SOP 78-9
and SFAS No. 66,

Accounting for Sales
of Real Estate

, we recognize gains on the contribution or sale of
real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner’s
interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

Cost
Capitalization:

Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with
and incremental to the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real
estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.

We capitalize
interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial
construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use. We believe the completion of the
building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and
that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate
industry. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our
average borrowing rate on existing debt.

We also capitalize
direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during
extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been
completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its
intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease,
then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are
resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project
costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs
on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the
completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90%
occupancy.  In addition, all leasing
commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are
capitalized.


In assessing the amount
of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a
department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is
warranted (i.e., construction, development and leasing) and those for which
capitalization is not warranted  (i.e.,
property management, maintenance, acquisitions and dispositions and general
corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their
time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations
are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each
activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each
department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable
activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.

To ensure that an
appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized costs
that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards
we developed. These standards consist of a percentage of the total development
costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable
under a specific lease. These standards are derived after considering the
amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were
working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead
costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing
activities are not capitalized.

Impairment
of Real Estate Investments:

We evaluate our real estate investments upon
occurrence of significant changes in the operations, but not less than
annually, to assess whether any impairment indications are present that affect
the recovery of the recorded value. If any real estate investment is considered
to be impaired, a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to
its estimated fair value. We utilize the guidelines established under SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long Lived Assets

(“SFAS 144”), to determine if impairment
conditions exist. Under SFAS 144, we review the expected undiscounted cash
flows of each property in our held for rental portfolio to determine if there
are any indications of impairment of a property. The review of anticipated cash
flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates
and ultimate residual value. In addition to reviewing anticipated cash flows,
we assess other factors such as changes in business climate and legal factors
that may affect the ultimate value of the property. These assumptions are subjective
and the anticipated cash flows may not ultimately be achieved.

Real estate assets
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value amount or
the fair value less estimated cost to sell.

Acquisition
of Real Estate Property and Related Assets:

In accordance with SFAS 141,

Business Combinations

, we allocate the
purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible
assets based on their respective fair values.

The allocation to
tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon
management’s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant
using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent
appraisers. Factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying
costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market
conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. The remaining purchase price
is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the
above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place
leases and the value of customer relationships.

·

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an
acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using an
interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease) of the
difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the
lease over its remaining term and (ii) management’s estimate of the
amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining
term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in
deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases
are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to
rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

·

The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place
lease values and to customer relationship values, based upon management’s
assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in
deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over
the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the
customer relationship, as applicable.


Valuation
of Receivables:

We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the
collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we
perform in-house credit reviews and analyses on major existing tenants and all
significant leases before they are executed. We have established the following
procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding
receivables and record allowances:

·

We maintain a tenant “watch list” containing a list of significant
tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk.
Various factors such as late rent payments, lease or debt instrument defaults,
and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when
determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list.

·

As a matter of policy, we reserve the entire receivable balance,
including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90
days.

·

Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any
other tenant identified as a potential long-term risk, regardless of the status
of rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

Construction
Contracts:

We
recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general
contractor on the percentage of completion method. Using this method, profits
are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage
of completion of individual contracts. A portion of the estimated profits is
accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the
construction contract. Cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater
than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a
contract’s term. This revenue recognition method involves inherent risks
relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval
and monitoring processes.

With regard to
critical accounting policies, management has discussed the following with the
Audit Committee:

·

Criteria for identifying and selecting;

·

Methodology in applying; and

·

Impact on the financial statements.

The Audit
Committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies we identified.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

We expect to meet
our short-term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months, including
payments of dividends and distributions, as well as recurring capital
expenditures relating to maintaining our current real estate assets, primarily
through the following:

·

working capital;

·

net cash provided by operating
activities; and

·

proceeds received from real estate
dispositions

Although we
historically have not used any other sources of funds to pay for recurring
capital expenditures on our current real estate investments, we may rely on the
temporary use of borrowings needed to fund such expenditures during periods of
high leasing volume.

We expect to meet
long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt
maturities, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and
other non-recurring capital improvements, primarily from the following sources:

·

issuance of additional equity, including
common and preferred shares;

·

issuance of additional debt securities;

·

undistributed cash provided by operating
activities; and

·

proceeds received from real estate
dispositions.


We do not believe the state of the credit markets
will adversely affect our ability to secure long-term financing.

Rental Operations

We believe our
principal source of liquidity, cash flows from Rental Operations, provides a
stable source of cash to fund operational expenses. We believe this cash-based
revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for
periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or
below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are
generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual
revenue recognition.

We are subject to
risks of decreased occupancy through market conditions, as well as tenant
defaults and bankruptcies, and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal
or re-letting of properties, each of which would result in reduced cash flow
from operations. However, we believe that these risks may be mitigated by our
relatively strong market presence in most of our markets and the fact that we
perform in-house credit reviews and analyses on major tenants and all
significant leases before they are executed.

Debt and Equity Securities

We had an
unsecured line of credit available at December 31, 2007.  During 2007, the borrowing capacity on this
line of credit was increased from $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion. Additionally,
in July 2007, one of our consolidated majority owned subsidiaries entered
into a lending agreement that included an additional unsecured line of
credit.  Our unsecured lines of credit as
of December 31, 2007 are described as follows (in thousands):

We use our line of
credit to fund development activities, acquire additional rental properties and
provide working capital. This line of credit provides us with an option to
obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line, at
rates lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain
restrictions.  The interest rate on the
amounts outstanding on the unsecured line of credit as of December 31,
2007 was  LIBOR plus .525%, which for
borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2007 ranged  from 
5.355% to 5.775%. Our line of credit also contains financial covenants
that require us to meet financial ratios and defined levels of performance,
including those related to variable interest indebtedness, consolidated net
worth and debt-to-market capitalization. As of December 31, 2007, we were
in compliance with all covenants under our line of credit.

The consolidated
subsidiary’s unsecured line of credit allows for borrowings up to $30.0 million
at a rate of LIBOR plus .85% (equal to 5.73% for outstanding borrowings as of December 31,
2007).  The unsecured line of credit is
used to fund development activities within the consolidated subsidiary.  The consolidated subsidiary’s unsecured line
of credit matures in July 2011 with a 12-month extension option.

At December 31,
2007, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3,
relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount
of debt securities (including guarantees thereof), common shares, preferred
shares, depository shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and Units
comprised of one or more of the securities described therein.  From time to time, we expect to issue additional
securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund
development and acquisition of additional rental properties and to fund the
repayment of the credit facility and other long-term debt upon maturity.


In February 2008, we issued $300.0 million of 8.375%
Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares.

The indentures
(and related supplemental indentures) governing our outstanding series of notes
also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding
our operations.  We were in compliance
with all such covenants as of December 31, 2007.

Sale
of Real Estate Assets

We utilize sales
of real estate assets as an additional source of liquidity. We pursue opportunities
to sell real estate assets at favorable prices to capture value created by us
as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio by recycling sale
proceeds into new properties with greater value creation opportunities.

Uses
of Liquidity

Our principal uses
of liquidity include the following:

·

Property investments;

·

Recurring leasing/capital costs;

·

Dividends and distributions to shareholders
and unitholders;

·

Long-term debt maturities; and

·

Other contractual obligations

Property
Investments

We evaluate
development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook, supply and
long-term growth potential.

Recurring
Expenditures

One of our principal uses
of our liquidity is to fund the recurring leasing/capital expenditures of our
real estate investments. The following is a summary of our recurring capital
expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively (in thousands):

Dividends and Distributions

In order to
qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must currently distribute
at least 90% of our taxable income to shareholders. We paid dividends per share
of $1.91, $1.89 and $1.87 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. We also paid a one-time special dividend of $1.05 per share
in 2005 as a result of the significant gain realized from an industrial
portfolio sale. We expect to continue to distribute taxable earnings to meet
the requirements to maintain our REIT status. However, distributions are
declared at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual
cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements
and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.


Debt
Maturities

Debt outstanding
at December 31, 2007 totaled $4.3 billion with a weighted average interest
rate of 5.74% maturing at various dates through 2028. We had $3.2 billion of
unsecured notes, $546.1 million outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit
and $524.4 million of secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2007.
Scheduled principal amortization and maturities of such debt totaled $249.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $146.4 million of secured debt
was transferred to unconsolidated subsidiaries in connection with the
contribution of properties in 2007.

The following is a
summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness
at December 31, 2007 (in thousands, except percentage data):

Historical
Cash Flows

Cash and cash
equivalents were $48.0 million and $68.5 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The following highlights significant changes in net cash
associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in
millions):

Operating
Activities

Cash flows from
operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational
requirements of our Rental Operations and Service Operations activities. The
receipt of rental income from rental operations continues to provide the
primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows. In addition, we develop
buildings with the intent to sell them at or soon after completion, which
provides another significant source of operating cash flow activity.  Highlights of such activity are as follows:

·

During the year ended December 31,
2007, we incurred Service Operations building development costs of $281.1
million, compared to $281.7 million and $83.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. The difference is reflective of the increased
activity in our held-for-sale pipeline. The pipeline of build-for-sale projects
under construction as of December 31, 2007, has anticipated total costs
upon completion of $455.8 million.

·

We
sold 15 Service Operations buildings in 2007 compared to nine in 2006 and ten
in 2005, receiving net proceeds of $232.6 million, $181.8 million and
$113.0 million, respectively. We recognized pre-tax gains of $34.7 million,
$49.0 million and $29.9 million on these sales for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


Investing
Activities

Investing activities are
one of the primary uses of our liquidity. Development and acquisition
activities typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows
for operational requirements. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses
are as follows:

·

Sales of land and
depreciated property provided $480.9 million in net proceeds in 2007, compared
to $180.8 million in 2006 and $1.1 billion in 2005. We sold portfolios of
eight suburban office properties in our Cleveland market and twelve industrial
properties in our St. Louis market during 2007, which together provided $203.5
million of the net proceeds received in 2007. We sold a portfolio of eight
industrial properties in our Cleveland market during 2006, which provided $69.8
million of the net proceeds received in 2006. 
An industrial portfolio sale provided $955.0 million of the $1.1 billion
of proceeds received in 2005. We continue to dispose of non-strategic and older
properties as part of our capital recycling program to fund acquisitions and
new development while improving the overall quality of our investment
portfolio.

·

We received financing
distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries (as a result of the sale of
properties or recapitalization) of $235.8 million in 2007, compared to
$296.6 million in 2006.

·

Development costs for our
held for rental portfolio increased to $451.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2007, from $385.5 million and $210.0 million for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. Management anticipated this continued increase, as
a commitment to development activity was part of our strategic plan for 2007.

·

During 2007, we paid cash of
$117.4 million for real estate acquisitions, including both $36.1 million for
the Bremner acquisition (with the remaining $11.0 million paid through the
issuance of Units in Duke Realty Limited Partnership) and $55.4 million for a
portfolio of industrial properties located in Seattle, Virginia and Houston,
compared to $735.3 million in 2006 and $285.3 million in 2005.  In addition, we paid cash of  $317.3 million for undeveloped land in 2007,
compared to $435.9 million in 2006 and $135.8 million in 2005.  The most significant activity in 2006
consisted of the purchase of a portfolio of suburban office and light
industrial properties and undeveloped land in the Washington, D.C. area for
$867.6 million (of which $713.5 million was paid in cash) and the purchase of a
portfolio of industrial properties in Savannah, Georgia for $196.2 million (of
which $125.9 million was paid in cash).

Financing
Activities

The overall decline in
cash provided by (used for) financing activities is a result of the financing
that was required for the significant acquisitions in 2006.  Specifically, the following items highlight
major fluctuations in net cash flow related to financing activities:

·

In
September 2007, we issued $300.0 million of 6.50% senior unsecured notes due
in 2018.  The proceeds were used to
partially pay down our unsecured line of credit.  Our primary borrowing activity in 2006
consisted of a $700.0 million secured term loan obtained in February 2006,
which was priced at LIBOR +.525% and was paid in full in August 2006 with
proceeds from two unsecured debt issuances: 
$450.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and $250.0
million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2011.

·

In
August 2007, we repaid $100.0 million of 7.375% senior unsecured notes on
the scheduled maturity date.

·

In
October 2007, we issued 7.0 million shares of our common stock for net
proceeds of $232.7 million.  The net
proceeds of the offering were used to partially pay down our $1.3 billion
unsecured line of credit.

·

Also
in October 2007, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our 7.990% Series B
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at the liquidation amount of $132.3
million.

·

In
November 2007, we repaid $100.0 million of 3.5% senior unsecured notes on
the scheduled maturity date.


Credit
Ratings

We are
currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior
unsecured notes from Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s Ratings
Group. We have been assigned ratings of BBB+ and Baa1, respectively, by
Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s Investors Service.

We
also received investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on
our preferred stock.  We have been
assigned ratings of BBB and Baa2, respectively, by Standard and Poor’s Ratings
Group and Moody’s Investors Service.

These
senior notes and preferred stock ratings could change based upon, among other
things, our results of operations and financial condition.

Financial
Instruments

We are exposed to capital
market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the
volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate
hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

In November 2007, we
entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward-starting
interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated
debt offerings in 2008. The swaps qualify for hedge accounting, with any
changes in fair value recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). At December 31,
2007, the fair value of these swaps was approximately $6.2 million in a
liability position as the effective rate on the swaps was higher than current
interest rates at December 31, 2007.

In July 2007, we
entered into a $21.0 million cash flow hedge through an interest rate swap to
fix the rate on $21.0 million of floating rate term debt, issued by one of our
consolidated majority owned subsidiaries, which matures in July 2011.  The swap qualifies for hedge accounting, with
any changes in fair value recorded in OCI. 
At December 31, 2007, the fair value of this swap was approximately
$1.1 million in a liability position.

In August 2005, we
entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward-starting
interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated
debt offerings in 2007. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any
changes in fair value recorded in OCI. In conjunction with the September 2007
issuance of $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes, we terminated these cash
flow hedges as designated.  The settlement
amount received of $10.7 million will be recognized to earnings through a
reduction of interest expense over the term of the hedged cash flows.  The ineffective portion of the hedge was
insignificant.

In March 2005, we
entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward-starting
interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated
debt offerings in 2006. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any
changes in fair value recorded in OCI. 
In March 2006, we issued $150.0 million of 5.50% senior unsecured
notes due 2016 and terminated a corresponding amount of the cash flow hedges
designated for this transaction. The settlement amount paid of approximately
$800,000 will be recognized to earnings through interest expense ratably over
the life of the senior unsecured notes and the ineffective portion of the hedge
was insignificant.  In August 2006,
we issued $450.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $250.0
million of 5.63% senior unsecured notes due 2011 and terminated the remaining
$150.0 million of cash flow hedges.  The
settlement amount received of approximately $1.6 million will be recognized to
earnings through a reduction of interest expense ratably over the lives of the
senior unsecured notes. The ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant.

The effectiveness of our hedges will be
evaluated throughout their lives using the hypothetical derivative method under
which the change in fair value of the actual swap designated as the hedging instrument
is compared to the change in fair value of a hypothetical swap.


Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in Unconsolidated Companies

We
have equity interests generally ranging from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated
companies that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development.
The equity method of

accounting

(see Critical Accounting Policies) is used for
these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence,
but not control, over operating and financial policies. As a result, the assets
and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet.

Our
investments in and advances to unconsolidated companies represents
approximately 8% of our total assets as of December 31, 2007. These
investments provide several benefits to us, including increased market share,
tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund
real estate projects.

The following table presents summarized financial information for
unconsolidated companies for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively  (in thousands, except
percentage data):

We do not have any
relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (“special
purpose entities”) that have been established solely for the purpose of
facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual
Obligations

At December 31, 2007, we are subject to
certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below:


Related Party Transactions

We provide property
management, leasing, construction and other tenant related services to
unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests. For the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, we received from these
unconsolidated companies management fees of $7.1 million, $4.4 million and $4.8
million, leasing fees of $4.2 million, $2.9 million and $4.3 million and
construction and development fees of $13.1 million, $19.1 million and $2.0
million. We recorded these fees based on contractual terms that approximate
market rates for these types of services, and we have eliminated our ownership
percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments
and Contingencies

We have guaranteed the
repayment of $79.3 million of economic development bonds issued by various
municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We will be
required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental
taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt
service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be
required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

We also have guaranteed
the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of seven of our unconsolidated
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on these loans
was approximately $219.8 million. Additionally, we guaranteed $29.0 million of
secured indebtedness related to a property sold to a third party in 2006.
Management believes that the value of the real estate exceeds the loan balance
and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees.

We have entered into
agreements, subject to the completion of due diligence requirements, resolution
of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions, for
the future acquisitions of land and buildings totaling $158.9 million. In most
cases we may withdraw from land purchase contracts with the seller’s only
recourse being earnest money deposits already made.

In October 2000, we
sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair
value of $487.0 million to a joint venture (Dugan Realty LLC) in which we have
a 50% interest and recognized a net gain of $35.2 million. In connection with
this transaction, the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to
a $50.0 million interest in the joint venture to us in exchange for our common
stock or cash (at our option), subject to certain timing and other
restrictions. As a result of this put option, we deferred $10.2 million of gain
on sale of depreciated property and recorded a $50.0 million liability.

We are subject to various
legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the amount of
any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect
our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

We adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), on January 1, 2007.  The
adoption of FIN 48 resulted in an additional tax exposure of approximately $1.7
million recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of Distributions in
Excess of Net Income. As of December 31, 2007, tax returns for the
calendar years 2004 through 2007 remain subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) and various state and local tax jurisdictions.  Our uncertain tax positions are immaterial
both individually and in the aggregate primarily due to our tax status as a
REIT.


In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair
Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”). 
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure about fair value
measurements.  SFAS 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.  We do not expect SFAS 157 to have a material
effect when adopted.

In January 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS
159”).  SFAS 159 provides a “Fair Value
Option” under which a company may irrevocably elect fair value as the initial
and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and
liabilities.  This Fair Value Option will
be available on a contract-by-contract basis with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings as those changes occur. 
The effective date for SFAS 159 is the beginning of each reporting
entity’s first fiscal year end that begins after November 15, 2007.  We will not elect the Fair Value Option for
any of our financial assets or liabilities.

In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,

Business
Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”) and SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements

— an amendment to ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”).  SFAS 141R and SFAS 160
require most identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and
goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at “full fair value”
and require noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority
interests) to be reported as a component of equity, which changes the
accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders.  Both Statements are effective for periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and earlier adoption is
prohibited.  SFAS 141R will be applied to
business combinations occurring after the effective date.  SFAS 160 will be applied prospectively to all
noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before the effective
date.  We are currently evaluating the
impact of adopting SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 on our results of operations and financial
position.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About
Market Risks

We are exposed to interest rate
changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long-term debt
borrowings. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact
of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall
borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed rates
and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate
swaps, caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a
related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate
transactions for speculative purposes.

Our
interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below
presents the principal amounts (in thousands) of the expected annual
maturities, weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in
the specified period, fair values and other terms required to evaluate the
expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.

As the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31,
2007, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after
that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to
interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the
period, our hedging strategies at that time, and interest rates.


Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The financial statements and supplementary data are included under Item
15 of this Report.

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures

We conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our “disclosure
controls and procedures” as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report. The controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer.

Attached as exhibits to
this Annual Report are certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This Controls and Procedures section
includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the
certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for
a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15f under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) are controls and other procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also
designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including the Company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Based on the disclosure
controls and procedures evaluation referenced above, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective.

Management’s annual
report on internal control over financial reporting and the audit report of our
registered public accounting firm are included in Item 15 of Part IV under
the headings “Management’s Report on Internal Control” and “Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,” respectively, and are
incorporated herein by reference.

There were no changes in
our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31,
2007, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control

We, as management of Duke Realty Corporation and its
subsidiaries (“Duke”), are responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and includes those policies and procedure that:

·

Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company;

·

Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and

·

Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 based on the control criteria
established in a report entitled Internal Control — Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of December 31,
2007, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these
criteria.

The independent registered public accounting firm of KPMG LLP, as
auditors of Duke’s consolidated financial statements, has issued an audit
report on Duke’s internal control over financial reporting.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Shareholders
and Directors of

Duke Realty
Corporation:

We have audited
the consolidated

balance sheets of Duke Realty
Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007 and
2006 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders’ equity for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007.  In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement
schedule III. We also audited the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for these consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying management’s report on internal control. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and the financial statement schedule and an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in
conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule III, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, Duke Realty Corporation
and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The Company

Our Rental
Operations (see Note 8) are conducted through Duke Realty Limited Partnership
(“DRLP”). We owned approximately 94.9% of the common partnership interests of
DRLP (“Units”) at December 31, 2007. The remaining Units in DRLP are
redeemable for shares of our common stock on a one-to-one basis and earn
dividends at the same rate as shares of our common stock. We conduct our
Service Operations (see Note 8) through Duke Realty Services LLC and Duke
Realty Services Limited Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner
and of which DRLP is the sole limited partner. We also conduct Service
Operations through Duke Construction Limited Partnership, which is effectively
100% owned by DRLP. The consolidated financial statements include our accounts
and our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries, and the terms “we”, “us” and
“our” refer to Duke Realty Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) and those
entities owned or controlled by the Company.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our
controlled subsidiaries. The equity

interests

in these
controlled subsidiaries not owned by us are reflected as minority interests in
the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Investments in entities that we do not control through majority voting interest
or where the other owner has substantial participating rights are not
consolidated and are reflected as investments in unconsolidated companies under
the equity method of reporting.

Reclassifications

Certain 2006 and 2005 balances
have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation.

Real
Estate Investments

Rental real property, including land, land improvements, buildings and
building improvements, are included in real estate investments and are
generally stated at cost. Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on
the straight-line method over their estimated life not to exceed 40 and 15
years, respectively, and tenant improvement costs are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the term of the related lease.

Direct and certain indirect costs clearly associated with and
incremental to the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real
estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. In addition, all
leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are
capitalized. We capitalize a portion of our indirect costs associated with our
construction, development and leasing efforts. In assessing the amount of
direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made based on
estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. We do not
capitalize any costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects.

We capitalize direct and indirect project costs associated with the
initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use. In addition, we capitalize costs,
including real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities, that have been allocated
to vacant space based on the square footage of the portion of the building not
held available for immediate occupancy during the extended lease-up periods
after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being
incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and
activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization
is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has
been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up
periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the
building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.

Construction in process and land held for development are included in
real estate investments and are stated at cost. Real estate investments also
include our equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and
operate rental properties and hold land for development.

Properties held for rental are individually evaluated for impairment
when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of
expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis) from a rental property
over its anticipated holding period is less than its historical net cost basis.
Upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred, a loss is recorded
to reduce the net book value of that property to its fair market value.
Properties to be disposed of are reported at the lower of net historical cost
basis or the estimated fair market value, less the estimated costs to sell.
Once a property is designated as held for disposal, no further depreciation
expense is recorded.

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible
and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, based
on all pertinent information available and adjusted based on changes in that
information in no event to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The

allocation to tangible assets
(buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management’s
determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using
discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers.
Factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during
the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs
to execute similar leases. The remaining purchase price is allocated among
three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market
component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and the value of
customer relationships.

The value
allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease
is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which
reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference
between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over
its remaining term and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that
would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The
amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and
other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other
liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the
remaining terms of the respective leases.

The total amount
of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and to
customer relationship values based upon management’s assessment of their
respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and
other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of
the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as
applicable.

Joint
Ventures

We analyze our investments in joint ventures under
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and
would require consolidation. To the extent that our joint ventures do not
qualify as variable interest entities, we further assess under the guidelines
of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the
Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF 04-5”); Statement of
Position 78-9,

Accounting for Investments in
Real Estate Ventures

(“SOP 78-9”);

Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

;

and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 94,

Consolidation of All Majority-Owned
Subsidiaries,

to determine if the venture should be consolidated. We
have equity interests generally ranging from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated joint
ventures


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

that develop, own and operate rental properties and
hold land for development. We consolidate those joint ventures that are
considered to be variable interest entities where we are the primary
beneficiary.  For non-variable interest
entities, we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority
ownership interests or where we are the managing member and our partner does
not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by
the ability of the general partner to manage day-to-day operations, refinance
debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the
limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general
partner. We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where
we do not have control over operating and financial polices. Under the equity
method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our
balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for
which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint
venture, our investment in joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the
assets that were contributed to the joint venture.  To the extent that our cost basis is
different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis
difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our
share of equity in net income of the joint venture.  In accordance with the provisions of SOP 78-9
and SFAS No. 66,

Accounting for Sales
of Real Estate

(“SFAS 66”), we recognize gains on the contribution
or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner’s
interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

Cash
Equivalents

Investments with an original maturity of three months or less are
classified as cash equivalents.

Valuation
of Receivables

We reserve the entire receivable balance,
including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90
days. Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant with long-term risk,
regardless of the status of rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as
necessary.

Deferred
Costs

Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are amortized to
interest expense on the straight-line method, which approximates a constant
spread over the term of the related loan. All direct and indirect costs,
including

estimated

internal costs, associated with the leasing of
real estate investments owned by us are capitalized and amortized over the term
of the related lease. We include lease incentive costs, which are payments made
on behalf of a tenant to sign a lease, in deferred leasing costs and amortize
them on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms as a reduction of
rental revenues. We include as lease incentives amounts funded to construct
tenant improvements owned by the tenant. Unamortized costs are charged to
expense upon the early termination of the lease or upon early payment of the
financing.

Minority Interest

Minority interests relate to the minority ownership interests in DRLP
and interests in consolidated property partnerships that are not wholly-owned.
Minority interest is subsequently adjusted for additional contributions,
distributions to minority holders and the minority holders’ proportionate share
of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity.

The value of each DRLP Unit that is redeemed is measured on the date of
its redemption and the difference between the aggregate book value and the
purchase price of the Units increases the recorded value of the Company’s net
assets.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Revenues

Rental Operations

The timing of revenue recognition under an operating lease is
determined based upon ownership of the tenant improvements. If we are the owner
of the tenant improvements, revenue recognition commences after the
improvements are completed and the tenant takes possession or control of the
space. In contrast, if we determine that the tenant allowances we are funding
are lease incentives, then we commence revenue recognition when possession or
control of the space is turned over to the tenant. Rental income

from

leases with scheduled rental increases during their terms is recognized on a
straight-line basis.

We record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a
definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee
is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is
due to us.

Service Operations

Management fees
are based on a percentage of rental receipts of properties managed and are
recognized as the rental receipts are collected. Maintenance fees are based
upon established hourly rates and are recognized as th

e services are performed. Construction management and development fees
represent fee-based third-party contracts and are

recognized as earned
based on the terms of the contract, which approximates the percentage of
completion method.

We recognize
income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the
percentage of completion method. Using this

method, profits are recorded based on our estimates of the percentage of
completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under
the contracts reach a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable
accuracy. The percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of
the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. Changes in job
performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions
to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are
determined.

Unbilled receivables on construction contracts totaled $33.1 million
and $32.4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Property
Sales

Gains on sales of all properties are recognized in accordance with SFAS
66.

The
specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS 66
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the
form of management or financial assistance from the seller associated with the
properties.  We make judgments based on
the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit
from the transaction that we recognize considering factors such as continuing
ownership interest we may have with the buyer (“partial sales”) and our level
of future involvement with the property or the buyer that acquires the
assets.  If the sales criteria are not
met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the
property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as
appropriate, until the full accrual sales criteria are met.  Estimated future costs to be incurred after
completion of each sale are included in the determination of the gain on sales.

Gains from sales of depreciated property are included in discontinued
operations and the proceeds from the sale of these held-for-rental properties
are classified in the investing activities section of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Gains or losses from our sale of properties that were developed or
repositioned with the intent to sell and not for long-term rental are classified
as gain on sale of Service Operation properties in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. All activities and proceeds received from the development and
sale of these buildings are classified in the operating activities section of
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Net Income Per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income
available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share is
computed by dividing the sum of net income available for common shareholders
and the minority interest in earnings allocable to Units not owned by us, by
the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and
minority Units outstanding, including any dilutive potential common equivalents
for the period.

The following table reconciles the components of basic and diluted net
income per common share (in thousands):

(1)

Excludes the effect of outstanding stock options, as
  well as the Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Exchangeable Notes”) issued in 2006,
  that have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share for the periods
  presented.

A joint venture partner in one of our unconsolidated
  companies has the option to convert a portion of its ownership in the joint
  venture to our common shares. The effect of this option on earnings per share
  was anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Federal
Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of
organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to
distribute at least 90% of our adjusted taxable income to our stockholders.
Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to maintain
our REIT status. As a REIT, we are entitled to a tax deduction for some or all
of the dividends we pay to shareholders. Accordingly

, we generally will not be subject to federal income
taxes as long as we distribute an amount equal to or in excess of our taxable
income

currently to shareholders.  We are also generally subject to federal
income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to its
shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be
subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four
subsequent taxable years.

REIT qualification reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of state
and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the
operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a
dividends paid deduction and are subject to corporate federal, state and local
income taxes. As a REIT, we may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes
if we engage in certain types of transactions.

Our dividen

ds
paid deduction is summarized below (in thousands):

A summary of the tax characterization of the dividends paid for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 follows:

We recorded federal and state income taxes of $9.0 million, $6.8
million and $5.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which were
primarily attributable to the earnings of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We
paid federal and state income taxes of $10.1 million, $4.3 million and $8.7
million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The taxable REIT subsidiaries
have no significant deferred income tax items.

Stock Based Compensation

For all issuances of stock-based awards prior to 2002, we applied the
recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related interpretations, in accounting for our stock-based
compensation.

Accordingly, for stock options granted prior to 2002, no compensation
expense is reflected in net income as all options granted had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common shares on the date of the
grant.

Effective January 1, 2002, we prospectively adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”), and applied SFAS 123 to
all awards granted after January 1, 2002.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to all stock-based
employee compensation for the year ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands,
except per share data):

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R),

Share Based Payment

, (“SFAS 123(R)”),
using the modified prospective application method. Under this method, as
of  January 1, 2006, we applied the
provisions of SFAS 123(R) to new and modified awards, as well as to the
nonvested portion of awards granted before the required effective date and
outstanding at such time.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

We periodically enter into certain interest rate protection agreements
to effectively convert or cap floating rate debt to a fixed rate, and to hedge
anticipated future financing transactions, both of which qualify for cash flow
hedge accounting treatment. Net amounts paid or received under these agreements
are recognized as an adjustment to the interest expense of the corresponding
debt. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

If a derivative
qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is
recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective,
while the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value is
recognized in earnings. Gains and losses on our interest rate protection
agreements are subsequently included in earnings as an adjustment to interest
expense in the same periods in which the related interest payments being hedged
are recognized in earnings.

We estimate the
fair value of derivative instruments using standard market conventions and
techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and
termination cost at each balance sheet date. 
For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging
relationship and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the
hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being
hedged, how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged
risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of
the method of measuring ineffectiveness.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make
a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Significant Acquisitions and
Dispositions

Acquisitions

We acquired total income producing real estate related assets of $219.9
million, $948.4 million and $295.6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

In December 2007, in order to further establish our property
positions around strategic port locations, we purchased a portfolio of five
industrial buildings, in Seattle, Virginia and Houston, as well as
approximately 161 acres of undeveloped land and a 12-acre container storage
facility in Houston.  The total price was
$89.7 million and was financed in part through assumption of secured debt that
had a fair value of $34.3 million.  Of
the total purchase price, $66.1 million was allocated to in-service real estate
assets, $20.0 million was allocated to undeveloped land and the container storage
facility, $3.3 million was allocated to lease related intangible assets, and
the remaining amount was allocated to acquired working capital related assets
and liabilities.  This allocation of
purchase price based on the fair value of assets acquired is preliminary. The
results of operations for the acquired properties since the date of acquisition
have been included in continuing rental operations in our consolidated
financial statements.

In February 2007, we completed the acquisition of Bremner Healthcare
Real Estate (“Bremner”), a national health care development and management
firm.  The primary reason for the
acquisition was to expand our development capabilities within the health care
real estate market. The initial consideration paid to the sellers totaled $47.1
million, and the sellers may be eligible for further contingent payments over
the next three years. Approximately $39.0 million of the total purchase price
was allocated to goodwill, which is attributable to the value of Bremner’s
overall development capabilities and its in-place workforce.  The results of operations for Bremner since
the date of acquisition have been included in continuing operations in our
consolidated financial statements.

In February 2006, we acquired the majority of a Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area portfolio of suburban office and light industrial properties
(the “Mark Winkler Portfolio”). The assets acquired for a purchase price of
approximately $867.6 million are comprised of 32 in-service properties with
approximately 2.9 million square feet for rental, 166 acres of undeveloped
land, as well as certain related assets of the Mark Winkler Company, a real
estate management company. The acquisition was financed primarily through
assumed mortgage loans and new borrowings.

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their
estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, as summarized below (in
thousands):

In December 2006, we contributed 23 of these in-service properties
acquired from the Mark Winkler Portfolio with a basis of $381.6 million representing
real estate investments and acquired lease related intangible assets to two new
unconsolidated subsidiaries. Of the remaining nine in-service properties, eight
were contributed to these two unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2007 and one
remains in continuing operations as of December 31, 2007. The eight
properties contributed in 2007 had a basis of $298.4 million representing real
estate investments and acquired lease related intangible assets, and debt
secured by these properties of $146.4 million was also assumed by the
unconsolidated subsidiaries.

In the third quarter of 2006, we finalized the purchase of a portfolio of
industrial real estate properties in Savannah, Georgia. We completed a majority
of the purchase in January 2006. The assets acquired for a purchase price
of approximately $196.2 million are comprised of 18 buildings with
approximately 5.1 million square feet for rental as well as over 60 acres of
undeveloped land.  The acquisition was
financed in part through assumed mortgage loans. The results of operations for
the acquired properties since the date of acquisition have been included in
continuing rental operations in our consolidated financial statements.

The primary acquisition in 2005 was that of a suburban office portfolio
in our Chicago market for a purchase price of approximately $257.6 million. The
results of operations for the six properties in this portfolio have been
included in continuing rental operations in our consolidated financial
statements since the date of acquisition.

Dispositions

In March 2007, as part of our capital recycling program, we sold a
portfolio of eight suburban office properties totaling 894,000 square feet in
the Cleveland market. The sales price totaled $140.4 million, of which we
received net proceeds of $139.3 million. We also sold a portfolio of twelve
flex and light industrial properties in July 2007, totaling 865,000 square
feet in the St. Louis market, for a sales price of $65.0 million, of which we
received net proceeds of $64.2 million.

On September 29, 2005, we completed the sale of a portfolio of 212
real estate properties, consisting of approximately 14.1 million square feet of
primarily light distribution and service center properties and approximately 50
acres of undeveloped land (the “Industrial Portfolio Sale”). The sales price
totaled $983 million, of which we received net proceeds of $955.0 million after
the settlement of certain liabilities and transaction costs. Portions of the
proceeds were used to pay down $423.0 million outstanding on our unsecured line
of credit and the entire outstanding balance on our $400.0 million term loan.
The 2005 operations and gain associated with the properties in the Industrial
Portfolio Sale have been reclassified to

the sale, a one-time special cash dividend of $1.05 per share was paid to our
common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Related
Party Transactions

We provide

property

management, leasing, construction
and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have
equity interests. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, we received from these unconsolidated companies management fees
of $7.1 million, $4.4 million and $4.8 million, leasing fees of $4.2 million,
$2.9 million and $4.3 million and construction and development fees of $13.1
million, $19.1 million and $2.0 million. We recorded these fees based on
contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services,
and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the
consolidated financial statements.

Investments
in Unconsolidated Companies

We have equity
interests generally ranging from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated joint ventures
that develop, own and operate rental properties and hold land for development.

Discontinued
Operations and Assets Held for Sale

We
classified the operations of 302 buildings as discontinued operations as of December 31,
2007. These 302 buildings consist of 253 industrial, 48 office and one retail
properties. Of these properties, 32 were sold during 2007, 21 properties were
sold during 2006, 234 properties were sold during 2005 and 15 operating
properties are classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2007.

The
following table illustrates operations of the buildings reflected in
discontinued

operations for the years ended December 31
(in thousands):

At December 31,
2007, we classified 15 properties as held-for-sale and included in discontinued
operations.  Additionally, we have
classified nine in-service properties as held-for-sale, but have included the
results of operations of these properties in continuing operations, either
based on our present intention to sell the majority of our ownership interest
in the properties to entities in which we will retain a minority equity
ownership interest or because the results of operations for the properties are
immaterial. The following table illustrates aggregate balance sheet information
of the aforementioned 15 properties included in discontinued operations, as
well as the nine held-for-sale properties whose results are included in
continuing operations at December 31, 2007 (in thousands):

We
allocate interest expense to discontinued operations and have included such
interest expense in computing net income from discontinued operations. Interest
expense allocable to discontinued operations includes interest on any debt on
secured properties included in discontinued operations and an allocable share
of our consolidated unsecured interest expense for unencumbered properties. The
allocation of unsecured interest expense to discontinued operations was based
upon the gross book value of the discontinued operations unencumbered
population as it related to our entire unencumbered population.

We recorded
impairment adjustments on depreciable properties of $266,000 and $3.7 million
in 2006 and 2005, respectively.  No
impairment adjustments were recorded on depreciable properties in 2007.

Indebtedness

Indebtedness at December 31, 2007 and 2006 consists of the following
(in thousands):

The fair value of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2007, was
$4.2 billion. This fair value amount was calculated using current market rates
and spreads available to us on debt instruments with similar terms and
maturities.

As of December 31, 2007, the $524.4 million of secured debt was
collateralized by rental properties with a carrying value of $723.0 million and
by letters of credit in the amount of $9.1 million.

We had an unsecured line of credit available at December 31,
2007.  During 2007, the borrowing
capacity on this line of credit was increased from $1.0 billion to $1.3
billion. Additionally, in July 2007, one of our consolidated majority
owned subsidiaries entered into a lending agreement that included an additional
unsecured line of credit.  Our unsecured
lines of credit as of December 31, 2007 are described as follows (in
thousands):

We use our line of credit to fund development activities, acquire
additional rental properties and provide working capital. This line of credit
provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions
that participate in the line, at rates lower than the stated interest rate,
subject to certain restrictions.  The
interest rate on the amounts outstanding on the unsecured line of credit as of December 31,
2007 was LIBOR plus .525%, which for borrowings outstanding at December 31,
2007 ranged from  5.355% to 5.775%. Our
line of credit also contains various financial covenants that require us to
meet financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those
related to variable rate indebtedness, consolidated net worth and
debt-to-market capitalization. As of December 31, 2007, we were in
compliance with all covenants under our line of credit.

The consolidated subsidiary’s unsecured line of credit allows for
borrowings up to $30.0 million at a rate of LIBOR plus .85%  (equal to 5.73% for outstanding borrowings as
of December 31, 2007).  The
unsecured line of credit is used to fund development activities within the
consolidated subsidiary.  The
consolidated subsidiary’s unsecured line of credit matures in July 2011
with a 12-month extension option.

We

took the
following actions during the year ended December 31, 2007, relevant to our
indebtedness:

·

In August 2007, we repaid $100.0
million of 7.375% senior unsecured notes on the scheduled maturity date.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

·

In September 2007, we issued $300.0 million of
6.50% senior unsecured notes due in January 2018.  This issuance was hedged with a forward
starting interest rate swap that was settled and reduced the effective interest
rate to 6.16%.  The net proceeds from
that issuance were used to partially pay down the outstanding balance on our
unsecured line of credit.

·

In November 2007, we repaid $100.0 million of
3.5% senior unsecured notes on the scheduled maturity date.

In November 2006,
we issued $575.0 million of 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Exchangeable
Notes”), which will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 3.75% per annum and
mature in December 2011.

The Exchangeable
Notes can be exchanged for shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of
certain events as well as at any time beginning on August 1, 2011 and
ending on the second business day prior to the maturity date.  The Exchangeable Notes had an initial
exchange rate of approximately 20.4298 common shares per $1,000 principal
amount of the notes, representing an exchange price of approximately $48.95 per
share of Duke’s common stock and an initial exchange premium of approximately
20.0% based on the price of $40.79 per share of our common stock on the date of
the original issuance. The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment under
certain circumstances including increases in our rate of dividends. Upon
exchange the holders of the notes would receive (i) cash equal to the
principal amount of the note and (ii) to the extent the conversion value
exceeds the principal amount of the note, either cash or shares of common stock
at our option.

Concurrent with
the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, we purchased a capped call option on
our common stock in a private transaction. 
This capped call option allows us to buy our common shares, up to a
maximum of approximately 11.7 million shares, from counter parties equal to the
amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value we
would pay to the holders of the Exchangeable Notes upon conversion.  The capped call option will terminate upon the
earlier of the maturity date of the related Exchangeable Notes or the first day
all of the related Exchangeable Notes are no longer outstanding due to
conversion or otherwise.  The capped call
option, which cost $27.0 million, was recorded as a reduction of shareholders’
equity

and effectively increased the conversion price to 40% above the stock
price on the issuance date.  The fair
value of the capped call option was $1.9 million at December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2007, the scheduled amortization and maturities of
all indebtedness for the next five years and thereafter were as follows  (in thousands):

The amount of interest paid in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $225.8 million,
$198.1 million and $151.3 million, respectively. The amount of interest
capitalized in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $59.2 million,  $36.3 million and $9.5 million, respectively.

Segment Reporting

We are engaged in
three reportable operating segments, the first two of which consist of the
ownership and rental of office and industrial real estate investments. The
operations of our office and industrial properties, along with our
healthcare  properties (our healthcare
properties, and other property types which are not significant are not
separately presented as a reportable segment), are collectively referred to as
“Rental Operations”. The third reportable segment consists of our build-to-suit
for sale operations and providing various real estate services such as property
management, maintenance, leasing, development and construction management to
third-party property owners and joint ventures (“Service Operations”). Our
reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed
separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and
management expertise.

The assets of the
Service Operations business segment generally include properties under
development.  During the period between
the completion of development, rehabilitation or repositioning of a Service
Operations property and the date the property is contributed to a property fund
or sold to a third party, the property and its associated rental income and
rental expenses are included in the applicable Rental Operations segment
because the primary activity associated with the Service Operations property
during that period is rental activities. 
Upon contribution or sale, the resulting gain or loss is part of the
income of the Service Operations business segment.

Other revenue
consists mainly of equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies. Segment FFO
information (FFO is defined below) is calculated by subtracting operating
expenses attributable to the applicable segment from segment revenues.
Non-segment assets consist of corporate assets including cash, deferred
financing costs and investments in unconsolidated companies. Interest expense
and other non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to
individual segments in determining our performance measure.

We assess and
measure segment operating results based upon an industry performance measure
referred to as Funds From Operations (“FFO”), which management believes is a
useful indicator of our operating performance.

FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental
operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust
(“REIT”) like Duke. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that
was adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). 
NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating
performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from
net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 
FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure developed by NAREIT to compare the
operating performance of REITs.  The most
comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). 
FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other
measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies.

Historical cost
accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values instead have
historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and
investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate
companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by
themselves.  FFO, as defined by NAREIT,
represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined
under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate
assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and
amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and
joint ventures.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Management
believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP
presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among
the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more
meaningful.  Management believes FFO is a
useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance
(although FFO should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains
the primary measure of performance) because by excluding gains or losses
related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding
real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO provides a useful
comparison of the operating performance of our real estate between periods or
as compared to different companies.

The following table shows (i) the revenues and FFO for each of the
reportable segments and (ii) a reconciliation of net income available for
common shareholders to the calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands):

In addition to revenues and FFO, we also review our recurring capital
expenditures in measuring the performance of our individual Rental Operations
segments. These recurring capital expenditures consist of tenant improvements,
leasing commissions and building improvements. We review these expenditures to
determine the costs associated with re-leasing vacant space and maintaining the
condition of our properties. Our recurring capital expenditures by segment are
summarized as follows for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

Leasing
Activity

Future minimum rents due to us under non-cancelable operating leases at
December 31, 2007 are as follows (in thousands):

In addition to minimum rents, certain leases require reimbursements of
specified operating expenses that amounted to $177.2 million, $161.7 million
and $151.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

(10)

Employee
Benefit Plans

We maintain a 401(k) plan for full-time employees.  We make matching contributions up to an
amount equal to three percent of the employee’s salary and may also make annual
discretionary contributions. The total expense recognized for this plan was
$3.7 million, $3.9 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

We make contributions to a contributory health and welfare plan as
necessary to fund claims not covered by employee contributions. The total
expense we recognized related to this plan was $9.3 million, $9.4 million and
$8.1 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expense amounts
include estimates based upon the historical experience of claims incurred but
not reported as of year-end.

(11)

Shareholders’
Equity

We periodically access the public equity markets to fund the
development and acquisition of additional rental properties or to pay down
debt. The proceeds of these offerings are contributed to DRLP in exchange for
an additional interest in DRLP.

In October 2007, we redeemed all of
the outstanding shares of our 7.99% Series B Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock at a liquidation amount of $132.3 million. Offering costs of
$3.5 million were charged against net income available to common shareholders
in conjunction with the redemption of these shares.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following series of preferred shares were outstanding as of December 31,
2007 (in thousands, except percentage data):

All series of preferred shares require cumulative
distributions and have no stated maturity date (although we may redeem all such
preferred shares on or following their optional redemption dates at our option,
in whole or in part).

In October 2007,
we issued 7.0 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $232.7
million.

Pursuant

to
the $750.0 million share repurchase plan that was approved by our board of
directors, we paid approximately $91.9 million for the redemption of 2,266,684
of our common shares at an average price of $40.55 per share during the
year ended December 31, 2006. From time to time, management may repurchase
additional common shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan.

Stock Based Compensation

We are

authorized

to issue up to 9,949,314 shares
of our common stock under our stock based employee and non-employee
compensation plans.

Cash
flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost
from the exercise of stock options (excess tax benefits) were not significant
in any period presented.

Fixed Stock Option
Plans

We had options outstanding under six fixed
stock option plans as of December 31, 2007. Additional grants may be made
under one of those plans. Stock option awards granted under our stock based
employee and non-employee compensation plans generally vest over five years at
20% per year and have contractual lives of ten years.  The exercise price for stock option grants is
set at the fair value of our common stock on the day of grant.

The following table summarizes transactions under

our stock option plans as of December 31,
2007:

Options granted in
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, had a
weighted average fair value per option of $2.89, $3.60 and $3.04. As of December 31,
2007, there was $6.7 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related
to stock options granted under the plans, which is expected to be recognized
over a weighted average remaining period of 3.91 years. The total intrinsic
value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005 respectively, was $5.6 million, $11.3 million and $3.4 million.  Compensation expense recognized for fixed
stock option plans was $2.3 million, $1.7 million and $1.1 million for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  The fair value of options vested during the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $1.6 million, $1.6
million and $1.2 million, respectively.

The fair values of
the options were determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following assumptions:

The risk free
interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for
the term of our employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based
on the history of and our present expectation of future dividend payouts. Our
computation of expected volatility for the valuation of stock options granted
in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is based on historic,
and our present expectation of future volatility over a period of time equal to
the expected term. The expected life of employee stock options represents the
weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.

Performance
Share Plan

Performance shares
were granted under the 2000 Performance Share Plan, with each performance share
economically equivalent to one share of our common stock. The performance
shares vest over a five-year period with the vesting percentage for a year
dependent upon our attainment of certain predefined levels of earnings growth
for such year. The performance shares have a contractual life of five years. In
April 2006, the 2000 Performance Share Plan was amended to provide that
awards would be settled in shares of common stock rather than cash. The fair
value of existing awards was fixed at the date of the amendment and the fair
value of subsequent awards will be fixed at the fair value of our common stock
at the date of grant.

The
following table summarizes transactions for our performance shares for the year
ended December 31, 2007:


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND

Compensation expense
recognized for Performance Share Plan units was $1.3 million, $1.2 million and
$1.3 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The total vest date fair
value of shares vesting during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1.1
million.

Shareholder Value Plan
Awards

Our 2005 Shareholder
Value Plan (“2005 SVP Plan”), a sub-plan of our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan,
was approved by our shareholders in April 2005. Upon vesting, payout of
the 2005 Shareholder Value Plan awards will be made in shares of our common
stock. Under the 2005 SVP Plan, shareholder value awards fully vest three years
after the date of grant. The number of common shares to be issued may range
from 0%-300% of the target shares awarded and will be based upon our total
shareholder return for such three-year period as compared to the S&P 500
Index and the NAREIT Real Estate 50 Index. Each index is weighted at 50%.

Awards made under the
2005 SVP Plan are measured at fair value, which is determined using a Monte Carlo
simulation model that was developed to accommodate the unique features of the
2005 SVP Plan. Compensation cost recognized under the 2005 SVP Plan was $1.5
million, $879,000 and $438,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

The following table
summarizes transactions for our awards under the 2005 SVP Plan for 2007:

As of December 31,
2007, there was $2.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related
to nonvested SVP Plan awards granted under the 2005 SVP Plan, which will be
recognized over a weighted average period of 1.73 years. All 2005 SVP Plan
awards have a contractual life of three years.

Restricted
Stock Units

Under our 2005 Long-Term
Incentive Plan and our 2005 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan approved
by our shareholders in April 2005, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) may be
granted to non-employee directors, executive officers and selected management
employees. An RSU is economically equivalent to one share of our common stock.
RSUs granted prior to January 1, 2006 vest 20% per year over five years,
have contractual lives of five years and are payable in shares of our common
stock.  RSUs granted to existing
non-employee directors subsequent to January 1, 2006 vest 100% over one
year, and have contractual lives of one year. We recognize the value of the
granted RSUs over this vesting period as expense.

The following table
summarizes transactions for our RSUs, excluding dividend equivalents, for 2007:


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND

Compensation cost
recognized for RSUs totaled $3.0 million, $2.1 million and $478,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As of December 31,
2007, there was $5.9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related
to nonvested RSUs granted under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized
over a weighted average period of 3.9 years.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital
market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the
volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate
hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

In November 2007, we
entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward-starting
interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated
debt offerings in 2008. The swaps qualify for hedge accounting, with any
changes in fair value recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). At December 31,
2007, the fair value of these swaps was approximately $6.2 million in a
liability position as the effective rate on the swaps was higher than current
interest rates at December 31, 2007.

In July 2007, we
entered into a $21.0 million cash flow hedge though an interest rate swap to
fix the rate on $21.0 million of floating rate term debt, issued by one of
our consolidated majority owned subsidiaries, which matures in July 2011.  The swap qualifies for hedge accounting, with
any changes in fair value recorded in OCI. 
At December 31, 2007, the fair value of this swap was approximately
$1.1 million in a liability position.

In August 2005, we
entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward-starting
interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated
debt offerings in 2007. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any
changes in fair value recorded in OCI. 
In conjunction with the September 2007 issuance of $300.0 million
of senior unsecured notes, we terminated these cash flow hedges as
designated.  The settlement amount
received of $10.7 million will be recognized to earnings through a reduction of
interest expense over the term of the hedged cash flows.  The ineffective portion of the hedge was
insignificant.

In March 2005,
we entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward-starting interest
rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt
offerings in 2006. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any changes
in fair value recorded in OCI.  In March 2006,
we issued $150.0 million of 5.50% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and
terminated a corresponding amount of the cash flow hedges designated for this
transaction. The settlement amount paid of approximately $800,000 will be
recognized to earnings through interest expense ratably over the life of the
senior unsecured notes and the ineffective portion of the hedge was
insignificant.  In August 2006, we
issued $450.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $250.0
million of 5.63% senior unsecured notes due 2011 and terminated the remaining
$150.0 million of cash flow hedges.  The
settlement amount received of approximately $1.6 million will be
recognized to earnings through a reduction of interest expense ratably over the
lives of the senior unsecured notes. The ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant.

The effectiveness
of our hedges will be evaluated throughout their lives using the hypothetical
derivative method under which the change in fair value of the actual swap
designated as the hedging instrument is compared to the change in fair value of
a hypothetical swap.

We adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), on January 1, 2007.  The
adoption of FIN 48 resulted in an additional tax exposure of approximately $1.7
million recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of Distributions in
Excess of Net Income. As of December 31, 2007, tax returns for the
calendar years 2004 through 2007 remain subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) and various state and local tax jurisdictions. Our
uncertain tax positions are immaterial both individually and in the aggregate
primarily due to our tax status as a REIT.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair
Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”). 
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure about fair value
measurements.  SFAS 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.  We do not expect SFAS 157 to have a material
effect when adopted.

In January 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS
159”).  SFAS 159 provides a “Fair Value
Option” under which a company may irrevocably elect fair value as the initial
and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and
liabilities.   This Fair Value Option
will be available on a contract-by-contract basis with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings as those changes occur. 
The effective date for SFAS 159 is the beginning of each reporting
entity’s first fiscal year end that begins after November 15, 2007.  We will not elect the Fair Value Option for
any of our financial assets or liabilities.

In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (“SFAS 141R”) and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment to ARB
No. 51 (“SFAS 160”).  SFAS 141R and
SFAS 160 require most identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling
interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at
“full fair value” and require noncontrolling interests (previously referred to
as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity, which changes
the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders.  Both Statements are effective for periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and earlier adoption is
prohibited.  SFAS 141R will be applied to
business combinations after the effective date. SFAS 160 will be applied
prospectively to all noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before
the effective date.  We are currently
evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 on our results of
operations and financial position.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have guaranteed the
repayment of $79.3 million of economic development bonds issued by various
municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We will be
required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental
taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt
service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be
required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

We also have guaranteed
the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of seven of our unconsolidated
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on these loans
was approximately $219.8 million. Additionally, we guaranteed $29.0
million of secured indebtedness related to a property sold to a third party in
2006. Management believes that the value of the real estate exceeds the loan
balance and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees.


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We have entered into
agreements, subject to the completion of due diligence requirements, resolution
of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions, for
the future acquisitions of land and buildings totaling $158.9 million. In most
cases we may withdraw from land purchase contracts with the seller’s only
recourse being earnest money deposits already made.

In October 2000, we
sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair
value of $487.0 million to a joint venture (Dugan Realty LLC) in which we
have a 50% interest and recognized a net gain of $35.2 million. In
connection with this transaction, the joint venture partners were given an
option to put up to a $50.0 million interest in the joint venture to us in
exchange for our common stock or cash (at our option), subject to certain
timing and other restrictions. As a result of this put option, we deferred
$10.2 million of gain on sale of depreciated property and recorded a $50.0
million liability.

We are subject to various
legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
business.  In the opinion of management,
the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not
materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of
operations.
