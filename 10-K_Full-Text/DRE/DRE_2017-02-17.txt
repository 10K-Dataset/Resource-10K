Other than those portions of the Proxy Statement specifically incorporated by reference pursuant to Items 10 through 14 of Part III hereof, no other portions of the Proxy Statement shall be deemed so incorporated.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2016

of both Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "Duke Realty Corporation" or the "General Partner" mean Duke Realty Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries; and references to the "Partnership" mean Duke Realty Limited Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to the General Partner and the Partnership, collectively, and those entities owned or controlled by the General Partner and/or the Partnership.

Duke Realty Corporation is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") and is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning

99.0%

of the common partnership interests of the Partnership ("General Partner Units") as of

December 31, 2016

. The remaining

1.0%

of the common partnership interests ("Limited Partner Units" and, together with the General Partner Units, the "Common Units") are owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Partnership, the General Partner has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Partnership.

The General Partner and the Partnership are operated as one enterprise. The management of the General Partner consists of the same members as the management of the Partnership. As the sole general partner with control of the Partnership, the General Partner consolidates the Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same.

We believe combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of the General Partner and the Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits:

•

enhances investors' understanding of the General Partner and the Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;

•

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation of information since a substantial portion of the Company's disclosure applies to both the General Partner and the Partnership; and

•

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

We believe it is important to understand the few differences between the General Partner and the Partnership in the context of how we operate as an interrelated consolidated company. The General Partner's only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests in the Partnership. As a result, the General Partner does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Partnership and issuing public equity from time to time. The General Partner does not issue any indebtedness, but does guarantee some of the unsecured debt of the Partnership. The Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the business, directly or indirectly, and holds the ownership interests related to certain of the Company's investments. The Partnership conducts the operations of the business and has no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the General Partner, which are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for General Partner Units or Preferred Units, the Partnership generates the capital required by the business through its operations, its incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of Limited Partner Units to third parties.

Noncontrolling interests, shareholders' equity and partners' capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the General Partner and those of the Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the Partnership's financial statements include the interests in consolidated investees not wholly owned by the Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the General Partner's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Partnership level, as well as the common limited partnership interests in the Partnership, which are accounted for as partners' capital by the Partnership.

In order to highlight the differences between the General Partner and the Partnership, there are separate sections in this report, as applicable, that separately discuss the General Partner and the Partnership including separate financial statements, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure of the General Partner and the Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the collective Company.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT

Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Report on Form 10-K for the General Partner and the Partnership, including, without limitation, those related to our future operations, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words "believe," "estimate," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "seek," "could," "may" and similar expressions or statements regarding future periods are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements may contain such words.

These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from any predictions of future results, performance or achievements that we express or imply in this Report or in the information incorporated by reference into this Report. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may affect future results include, among others:

•

Changes in general economic and business conditions, including the financial condition of our tenants and the value of our real estate assets;

•

The General Partner's continued qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

•

Heightened competition for tenants and potential decreases in property occupancy;

•

Potential changes in the financial markets and interest rates;

•

Volatility in the General Partner's stock price and trading volume;

•

Our continuing ability to raise funds on favorable terms;

•

Our ability to successfully identify, acquire, develop and/or manage properties on terms that are favorable to us;

•

Potential increases in real estate construction costs;

•

Our ability to successfully dispose of properties on terms that are favorable to us, including, without limitation, through one or more transactions that are consistent with our previously disclosed strategic plans;

•

Our ability to retain our current credit ratings;

•

Inherent risks in the real estate business, including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, potential liability relating to environmental matters and liquidity of real estate investments; and

•

Other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in our other reports and other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Although we presently believe that the plans, expectations and results expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements are reasonable, all forward-looking statements are inherently subjective, uncertain and subject to change, as they involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including those beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict the nature, or assess the potential impact, of each new factor on our business. Given these uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements for events or circumstances that arise after the statement is made, except as otherwise may be required by law.

This list of risks and uncertainties, however, is only a summary of some of the most important factors and is not intended to be exhaustive. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included under the caption "Risk Factors" in this Report, and is updated by us from time to time in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings that we make with the SEC.

PART I

Item 1.  Business

Background

The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of bulk distribution ("industrial") and medical office real estate.

The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of an initial public offering in February 1986.

The Partnership was formed in October 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning

99.0%

of the Common Units at

December 31, 2016

. The remaining

1.0%

of the Common Units are owned by limited partners. Limited Partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement"), the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner.

At

December 31, 2016

, our diversified portfolio of


rental properties (including


jointly controlled in-service properties with

10.7 million

square feet,


consolidated properties under development with

8.4 million

square feet and

two

jointly controlled properties under development with

1.0 million

square feet) encompassed

139.6 million

rentable square feet and was leased by a diverse base of more than 1,400 tenants whose businesses include government services, manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, distribution, healthcare and professional services. We also owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), 2,190 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,600 acres through purchase options.

Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. We additionally have regional offices or significant operations in 20 other geographic or metropolitan areas including Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Central Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; New Jersey; Northern and Southern California; Pennsylvania; Raleigh, North Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri; Savannah, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; Washington D.C.; and South Florida. We had approximately 500 employees at

December 31, 2016

.

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information related to our operational, asset and capital strategies.

Reportable Operating Segments

We have

three

reportable operating segments at

December 31, 2016

, the first two of which consist of the ownership and rental of (i) industrial and (ii) medical office real estate investments. Properties not included in our reportable segments, which do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment, are generally referred to as non-reportable Rental Operations. The operations of our industrial and medical office properties as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations, are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations."

-


-

The third reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development, general contracting and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively referred to as "Service Operations." Our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), a legal entity through which certain of the segment's aforementioned operations are conducted. See Item 6, "Selected Financial Data," Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for financial information related to our reportable segments.

Competitive Conditions

As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which we believe, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage as a real estate operator and in future development activities.

We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or on local levels. As a result, we intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market share, to the extent it is in markets or product types that align with our asset strategy (see Item 7), and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on strong customer relationships to provide third-party construction services across the United States. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our industrial and medical office customers not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.

All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply and demand of similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator. In addition, our Service Operations face competition from a considerable number of other real estate companies that provide comparable services, some of whom may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us.

Corporate Governance

Since our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer operationally, but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. The General Partner's system of governance reinforces this commitment and, as a limited partnership that has one general partner owning over 90% of the Partnership's common interest, the governance of the Partnership is necessarily linked to the corporate governance of the General Partner. Summarized below are the highlights of the General Partner's Corporate Governance initiatives.

-


-

The General Partner's Code of Conduct (which applies to all Directors and employees of the General Partner, including the Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers) and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are available in the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of the General Partner's website at www.dukerealty.com. A copy of these documents may also be obtained without charge by writing to Duke Realty Corporation, 600 East 96th Street, Suite 100, Indianapolis, Indiana 46240, Attention: Investor Relations.  If we amend our Code of Conduct as it applies to the Directors and all Executive Officers of the General Partner or grant a waiver from any provision of the Code of Conduct to any such person, we may, rather than filing a current report on Form 8-K, disclose such amendment or waiver in the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of the General Partner's website at www.dukerealty.com.

Additional Information

For additional information regarding our investments and operations, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." For additional information about our business segments, see Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (8) Segment Reporting."

Available Information

In addition to this Report, we file quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. All documents that are filed with the SEC are available free of charge on the General Partner's corporate website, which is www.dukerealty.com. We are not incorporating the information on the General Partner's website into this Report, and the General Partner's website and the information appearing on the General Partner's website is not included in, and is not part of, this Report. You may also read and copy any document filed at the public reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this Report, you should carefully consider, in consultation with your legal, financial and other professional advisors, the risks described below, as well as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption "Risk Factors" in evaluating us and our business before making a decision regarding an investment in the General Partner's securities.

The risks contained in this Report are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem to be immaterial, also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. The trading price of the General Partner's securities could decline due to the materialization of any of these risks, and its shareholders and/or the Partnership's unitholders may lose all or part of their investment.

This Report also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section in this Report entitled "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.

Risks Related to Our Business

Our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the long-term risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness, or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to refinance borrowings by our unconsolidated subsidiaries on favorable terms or at all. If our debt cannot be paid, refinanced or extended, we may not be able to make distributions to shareholders and unitholders at expected levels. Further, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher interest rates or other restrictive financial covenants upon the refinancing, then such refinancing would adversely affect our cash flow and funds available for operation, development and distribution.

We are also subject to financial covenants under our existing debt instruments. Should we fail to comply with the covenants in our existing debt instruments, then we would not only be in breach under the applicable debt instruments but we would also likely be unable to borrow any further amounts under our other debt instruments and other debt obligations may be accelerated, which could adversely affect our ability to fund operations. We also have incurred, and may incur in the future, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Thus, if market interest rates increase, so will our interest expense, which could reduce our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and unitholders at expected levels.

-


-

Debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our shareholders and unitholders.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common equity and, at times, preferred equity issued by the General Partner. Debt financing may not be available over a longer period of time in sufficient amounts, on favorable terms or at all. If the General Partner issues additional equity securities, instead of debt, to manage capital needs, the interests of our existing shareholders and unitholders could be diluted.

Financial and other covenants under existing credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.

The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment obligations.

Downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs or reduce our access to funding sources in the credit and capital markets.

We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, consisting mostly of unsecured debt. We are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor's Ratings Group based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. All of our debt ratings remain investment grade, but there can be no assurance that we will not be downgraded or that any of our ratings will remain investment grade. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.

Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

If we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity, then we may be unable to pursue future development projects and other strategic initiatives.

To complete our ongoing and planned development projects, and to pursue our other strategic initiatives, we must continue to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to fund those activities. To generate that capital and liquidity, we rely upon funds from our existing operations, as well as funds that we raise through our capital raising activities. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our long-term needs, or if we are unable to generate capital and liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, then we may not be able to pursue development projects, acquisitions, or our other long-term strategic initiatives.

The General Partner's stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to its shareholders and to the Partnership's unitholders, if and when they convert their Limited Partner Units to shares of the General Partner's common stock.

The market price of the General Partner's common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in the General Partner's common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the General Partner's share price, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the General Partner's common stock, include uncertainty in the markets, general market and economic conditions, as well as those factors described in these "Risk Factors" and in other reports that we file with the SEC.

Many of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of the General Partner's common stock. If the market price of the General Partner's common stock declines, then its shareholders and the Partnership's unitholders, respectively, may be unable to resell their shares and units upon

-


-

terms that are attractive to them. We cannot assure that the market price of the General Partner's common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the securities markets in general may experience considerable unexpected price and volume fluctuations.

Our use of joint ventures may negatively impact our jointly-owned investments.

We currently have joint ventures that are not consolidated with our financial statements. We may develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:

•

We could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property;

•

Our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties;

•

Our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues; and

•

Maturities of debt encumbering our jointly owned investments may not be able to be refinanced at all or on terms that are as favorable as the current terms.

Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks.

Our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as computer viruses or unauthorized access. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.

We could also be negatively impacted by similar disruptions to the operations of our vendors or outsourced service providers.

Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders and unitholders could decrease as a result of factors related to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate that are outside of our control.

Our business is subject to the risks incident to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate, many of which involve circumstances not within our control. Such risks include the following:

•

Changes in the general economic climate;

•

The availability of capital on favorable terms, or at all;

•

Increases in interest rates;

•

Local conditions such as oversupply of property or a reduction in demand;

•

Competition for tenants;

•

Changes in market rental rates;

•

Delay or inability to collect rent from tenants who are bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise unwilling or unable to pay;

•

Difficulty in leasing or re-leasing space quickly or on favorable terms;

-


-

•

Costs associated with periodically renovating, repairing and reletting rental space;

•

Our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance on our properties;

•

Our ability to control variable operating costs;

•

Changes in government regulations; and

•

Potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, tax and other laws.

Further, a significant portion of our costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs and our debt service payments, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in cash flow from our properties. Any one or more of these factors could result in a reduction in our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders and unitholders.

Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from properties decreases.

Our financial results depend on leasing space in our real estate to tenants on terms favorable to us. Our income and funds available for distribution to our shareholders and unitholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot meet their lease obligations to us or we are unable to lease properties on favorable terms. In addition, if a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and we may incur substantial legal costs. Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment. As a result, we may have a reduction in our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders and unitholders.

Our real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to development.

We continue to selectively develop new, pre-leased properties for rental operations in our existing markets when accretive returns are present. These development activities generally require various government and other approvals, which we may not receive. In addition, we also are subject to the following risks associated with development activities:

•

Unsuccessful development opportunities could result in direct expenses to us;

•

Construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated, or possibly unprofitable;

•

Time required to complete the construction of a project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity;

•

Occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable; and

•

Favorable sources to fund our development activities may not be available.

We may be unsuccessful in operating completed real estate projects.

We face the risk that the real estate projects we develop or acquire will not perform in accordance with our expectations. This risk exists because of factors such as the following:

•

Prices paid for acquired facilities are based upon a series of market judgments; and

•

Costs of any improvements required to bring an acquired facility up to standards to establish the market position intended for that facility might exceed budgeted costs.

As a result, we may develop or acquire projects that are not profitable.

-


-

We are exposed to the risks of defaults by tenants.

Any of our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken their financial condition. In the event of default or the insolvency of a significant number of our tenants, we may experience a substantial loss of rental revenue and/or delays in collecting rent and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection, a court could allow the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants became unable to meet their obligations to us, became insolvent or declared bankruptcy.

We may be unable to renew leases or relet space.

When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if our tenants do renew or we are able to relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of renovations, if necessary) may be less favorable than current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space, or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than current rates, then our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected, especially if we were unable to lease a significant amount of the space vacated by tenants in our properties.

Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our facilities, including property, liability and environmental coverage. We believe this coverage is of the type and amount customarily obtained for real property. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current replacement cost of the damaged assets. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, acts of a governmental authority and other factors also may make it unfeasible to collect insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or destroyed. If an uninsured or underinsured loss occurred, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property, and we would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. We are also subject to the risk that our insurance providers may be unwilling or unable to pay our claims when made.

Our acquisition and disposition activity may lead to long-term dilution.

Our asset strategy is to reposition our investment concentration among product types and further diversify our geographic presence.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to execute the repositioning of our assets according to our strategy or that our execution will lead to improved results.

Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.

From time to time, we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:

•

liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

•

claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;

•

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

-


-

We could be exposed to significant environmental liabilities as a result of conditions of which we currently are not aware.

As an owner and operator of real property, we may be liable under various federal, state and local laws for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. In addition, we could have greater difficulty in selling real estate on which hazardous substances were present or in obtaining borrowings using such real estate as collateral. It is our general policy to have Phase I environmental audits performed for all of our properties and land by qualified environmental consultants at the time of purchase. These Phase I environmental audits have not revealed any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on our business. However, a Phase I environmental audit does not involve invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, and we cannot be sure that the Phase I environmental audits did not fail to reveal a significant environmental liability or that a prior owner did not create a material environmental condition on our properties or land which has not yet been discovered. We could also incur environmental liability as a result of future uses or conditions of such real estate or changes in applicable environmental laws.

We are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate-change related risks.

We are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase.

We do not currently consider that we are exposed to regulatory risk related to climate change. However, we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

If the General Partner were to cease to qualify as a REIT, it would lose significant tax benefits.

The General Partner intends to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Qualification as a REIT provides significant tax advantages to the General Partner. However, in order for the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT, it must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. Satisfaction of these requirements also depends on various factual circumstances not entirely within our control. The fact that the General Partner holds its assets through the Partnership further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the General Partner's REIT status. Although we believe that the General Partner can continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot offer any assurance that it will continue to do so or that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the qualification requirements or the federal income tax consequences of qualification. If the General Partner were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would have the following effects:

•

The General Partner would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders and would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates;

•

Unless the General Partner was entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, it would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a REIT;

•

The General Partner's net earnings available for investment or distribution to its shareholders would decrease due to the additional tax liability for the year or years involved; and

•

The General Partner would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders in order to qualify as a REIT.

-


-

As such, the General Partner's failure to qualify as a REIT would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of the General Partner's securities and, consequently, the Partnership's Units.

REIT distribution requirements limit the amount of cash we have available for other business purposes, including amounts that we need to fund our future capital needs.

To maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, the General Partner must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. The General Partner intends to continue to make distributions to its shareholders to comply with the 90% distribution requirement. However, this requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital for use for other business purposes. If we do not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements of the General Partner, we may have to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements. If the General Partner fails to satisfy the distribution requirement, it would cease to qualify as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and investments in REITs may change, which may result in the loss of our tax benefits of operating as a REIT.

The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of a REIT and an investment in a REIT may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time. The administration of President Trump, the House leadership and the Senate leadership all have expressed interest in passing comprehensive tax reform this year. Although none of the descriptions of tax reform proposals have specifically addressed the treatment of REITs, the revisions in U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect us and the tax consequences of an investment in the General Partner's common shares.

Some of the tax benefits identified as possibly being eliminated or reduced include various tax benefits that have been important to the real estate industry, including REITs, such as eliminating the like-kind exchange rules or the deduction of net interest expense.  Loss of a deduction for net interest expense would substantially increase our REIT taxable income and, absent amendments to the REIT rules, our distribution obligations.  In addition, it is possible that substantially reduced corporate tax rates or Senate interest in integrating taxation of shareholders and corporations could reduce or eliminate the relative attractiveness of REITs as a vehicle for owning real estate.

We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued, nor is the long-term impact of proposed tax reforms on the real estate industry clear.

We are subject to certain provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, which may reduce the likelihood of the General Partner's shareholders receiving a control premium for their shares.

Indiana anti-takeover legislation and certain provisions in our governing documents, as we discuss below, may discourage potential acquirers from pursuing a change-of-control transaction with us. As a result, the General Partner's shareholders may be less likely to receive a control premium for their shares.

Ownership Restriction.

Subject to certain exceptions, the General Partner's charter provides that no person or entity may beneficially own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (in value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the General Partner's outstanding common stock or 9.8% in value of its outstanding stock.

Unissued Preferred Stock.

The General Partner's charter permits its board of directors to classify unissued preferred stock by setting the rights and preferences of the shares at the time of issuance. This power enables the General Partner's board to adopt a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill. Although the General Partner has repealed its previously existing poison pill and its current board of directors has adopted a policy not to adopt a shareholder rights plan without shareholder approval, the General Partner's board can change this policy at any time. The adoption of a poison pill would discourage a potential bidder from acquiring a significant position in the General Partner without the approval of its board.

Business-Combination Provisions of Indiana Law.

The General Partner has not opted out of the business-combination provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law. As a result, potential bidders may have to

-


-

negotiate with the General Partner's board of directors before acquiring 10% of its stock. Without securing board approval of the proposed business combination before crossing the 10% ownership threshold, a bidder would not be permitted to complete a business combination for five years after becoming a 10% shareholder. Even after the five-year period, a business combination with the significant shareholder would either be required to meet certain per share price minimums as set forth in the Indiana Business Corporation Law or to receive the approval of a majority of the disinterested shareholders.

Control-Share-Acquisition Provisions of Indiana Law.

The General Partner has not opted out of the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law regarding acquisitions of control shares. Therefore, those who acquire a significant block (at least 20%) of the General Partner's shares may only vote a portion of their shares unless its other shareholders vote to accord full voting rights to the acquiring person. Moreover, if the other shareholders vote to give full voting rights with respect to the control shares and the acquiring person has acquired a majority of the General Partner's outstanding shares, the other shareholders would be entitled to special dissenters' rights.

Supermajority Voting Provisions.

The General Partner's charter prohibits business combinations or significant disposition transactions with a holder of 10% of its shares unless:

•

The holders of 80% of the General Partner's outstanding shares of capital stock approve the transaction;

•

The transaction has been approved by three-fourths of those directors who served on the General Partner's board before the shareholder became a 10% owner; or

•

The significant shareholder complies with the "fair price" provisions of the General Partner's charter.

Among the transactions with large shareholders requiring the supermajority shareholder approval are dispositions of assets with a value greater than or equal to $1,000,000 and business combinations.

Operating Partnership Provisions.

The limited partnership agreement of the Partnership contains provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, including a requirement that holders of at least 90% of the outstanding Common Units approve:

•

Any voluntary sale, exchange, merger, consolidation or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership in one or more transactions other than a disposition occurring upon a financing or refinancing of the Partnership;

•

The General Partner's merger, consolidation or other business combination with another entity unless after the transaction substantially all of the assets of the surviving entity are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for Common Units;

•

The General Partner's assignment of its interests in the Partnership other than to one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries; and

•

Any reclassification or recapitalization or change of outstanding shares of the General Partner's common stock other than certain changes in par value, stock splits, stock dividends or combinations.

We are dependent on key personnel.

The General Partner's executive officers and other senior officers have a significant role in the success of our Company. Our ability to retain our management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave our Company is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of industrial and medical office real estate.

The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations in 1986 and is the sole general partner of the Partnership.  The Partnership is a limited partnership formed in 1993, at which time all of the properties and related assets and liabilities of the General Partner, as well as proceeds from a secondary offering of the General Partner's common shares, were contributed to the Partnership.  Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. We operate the General Partner and the Partnership as one enterprise, and therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to the General Partner and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Partnership, collectively.

At

December 31, 2016

, we:

•

Owned or jointly controlled


industrial, medical office and office properties, of which


properties totaling

130.2 million

square feet were in service and


properties totaling

9.4 million

square feet were under development. The


in-service properties were comprised of


consolidated properties totaling

119.5 million

square feet and


jointly controlled properties totaling

10.7 million

square feet. The


properties under development consisted of


consolidated properties with

8.4 million

square feet and

two

jointly controlled properties with

1.0 million

square feet.

•

Owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), 2,190 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,600 acres through purchase options.

Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties in both existing and select new markets, and to continue to increase our investment in on-campus or hospital affiliated medical office properties.  Based on in-place net operating income, the Company's overall portfolio was comprised of 78% industrial, 21% medical office and 1% non-reportable rental operations at

December 31, 2016

and 73% industrial, 19% medical office and 8% non-reportable rental operations at

December 31, 2015

.

We have

three

reportable operating segments at

December 31, 2016

, the first two of which consist of the ownership and rental of (i) industrial and (ii) medical office real estate investments. Properties not included in our reportable segments, which do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment, are generally referred to as non-reportable Rental Operations.  Our non-reportable Rental Operations primarily include our office properties.  The operations of our industrial and medical office properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations, are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations."

The third reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development, general contracting and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively referred to as "Service Operations." Our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary, a legal entity through which certain of the segment's aforementioned operations are conducted.

Operational Strategy

Our operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations as well as FFO through (i) maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates, while also keeping lease-related capital costs contained, by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing new build-to-suit, substantially pre-leased and, in certain circumstances, speculative development projects; (iii) leveraging our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction manager on a fee basis; and (iv) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.

-


-

Asset Strategy

Our strategic objectives include (i) increasing our investment in quality industrial properties through development; (ii) managing our medical office portfolio nationally to focus on hospital system relationships in order to take advantage of demographic trends; (iii) acquiring industrial properties in markets we believe provide the best potential for future rental growth;  and (iv) maintaining an optimal land inventory through selected strategic land acquisitions, new development activity and sales of surplus land. We are continuing to execute our asset strategy through a disciplined approach by identifying development opportunities, identifying select acquisition targets where the asset quality and pricing meet our objectives and continually evaluating our portfolio for disposition by regularly identifying assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives.

Capital Strategy

Our capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure in coordination with the execution of our overall operational and asset strategies. We are focused on maintaining our current investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2016, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Services and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, which reflect increases to both ratings during 2016.

In support of our capital strategy, we employ an asset disposition program to sell non-strategic real estate assets, which generate proceeds that can be recycled into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives or otherwise manage our capital structure.

We continue to focus on improving our balance sheet by maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than 20%; and (iii) issuing common equity as needed to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic developments or acquisitions. With our successes to date and continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we expect to be in a very strong position to be opportunistic in our investment opportunities on a self-funding basis.

Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy

As a leading commercial real estate firm in the United States, we are committed to sustainable practices in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives. Our sustainability practices have included research, development, and deployment of sustainable building strategies and technologies, staff education and LEED accreditation to construct high-performing sustainable buildings and to operate an energy-efficient portfolio. We have successfully redeveloped a number of environmentally impacted sites by removing obsolete, unused buildings and cleaning up environmental contaminants. We are committed to charitable giving, volunteerism, diversity and inclusion that make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business. We are also committed to maintaining an effective corporate governance structure and compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies. Through these efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and community while mutually benefiting our tenants, investors, employees and the communities in which we operate.

Results of Operations

A summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three-year period ended

Year in Review

Overall, the economy has slightly underperformed forecasts as growth in the gross domestic product was 1.5% and there have been periods of volatility caused by oil pricing, Brexit and the United States presidential election.  The 10 year Treasury rate fluctuated between 1.5% and 2.0% for most of the year but ended the year at its high point of 2.3%.  The continued growth in e-commerce has been a significant positive for the bulk warehouse business.  Under these conditions, we were able to execute our asset and capital strategies and believe that we had a successful 2016 by all accounts.

The following table shows a reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders to the calculation of FFO attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively (in thousands):

In addition to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, we assess and measure the overall operating results of the General Partner and the Partnership based upon FFO, which is a non-GAAP industry performance measure that management believes is a useful indicator of consolidated operating performance.  FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT.  NAREIT created FFO as a non-GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Taxes associated with sales of previously depreciated real estate assets are also excluded from FFO as defined by NAREIT.  The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders. FFO attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders should not be

-


-

considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Management believes that the use of FFO attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders, combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that the use of FFO as a performance measure enables investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT's activity and assist them in comparing these operating results between periods or between different companies.

In accordance with our strategic plan, we substantially completed the disposition of our suburban office properties, further reduced leverage and continued to increase our investment in high quality industrial and medical office properties.  Additionally, we continued to experience improved operational metrics during


, which we believe validate our strategy.  Highlights of our


strategic and operational activities are as follows:

•

We generated

$538.6 million

of total net cash proceeds from the disposition of


consolidated buildings and 448 acres of wholly-owned undeveloped land.

•

We started new development projects with expected total costs of $697.2 million during


, which included $54.0 million of expected total costs for three development projects started within unconsolidated joint ventures. The development projects started in


were mostly comprised of new industrial projects and were, in aggregate, 67.0% pre-leased.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2016, pursuant to a pre-existing purchase option, we acquired


properties in the Washington D.C. area from an unconsolidated joint venture (the "Quantico Joint Venture").  These


properties were comprised of


industrial buildings and

three

office properties. These


properties were previously encumbered by a

$131.3 million

CMBS loan and, pursuant to the terms of the purchase option, we repaid the loan as consideration for the acquisition of the underlying properties.  One of the acquired office properties was sold immediately following the acquisition for

$53.4 million

, which was equal to the property's fair value.

•

During


, we placed 21 newly completed wholly-owned development projects in service, across all product types, which totaled 6.0 million square feet with total costs of $507.6 million.  These properties were 94.9% leased at December 31,


.

•

The total estimated cost of our consolidated properties under construction at December 31,


totaled

$713.1 million

, with

$338.6 million

of such costs already incurred. The total estimated cost for jointly controlled properties under construction was

$42.1 million

at December 31,


, with

$28.8 million

of costs already incurred. The consolidated properties under construction are

74%

pre-leased, while the jointly controlled properties under construction are

29%

pre-leased.

•

Same-property net operating income, on a cash basis, as defined hereafter under "Supplemental Performance Measures" grew by

6.0%

for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

, as compared to the same period in


.

•

The percentage of total square feet leased for our in-service portfolio of consolidated properties increased from

96.5%

at December 31,


to

97.2%

at December 31,


.

•

Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties totaled

26.2 million

square feet in


compared to

19.4 million

square feet in


.  The increase in total leasing activity in 2016 was largely the result of leasing new development projects as well as a higher volume of lease renewals.

•

Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties in


included

12.3 million

square feet of renewals, which represented a

75.6%

retention rate on a square foot basis, and resulted in a

13.7%

increase in net effective rents.

-


-

We utilized the capital generated during the year to reduce debt and to fund our development activities.  Highlights of our key financing activities are as follows:

•

Throughout 2016, we issued

8.4 million

shares of common stock pursuant to our at the market ("ATM") equity program at an average price of $25.93 per share, generating gross proceeds of

$218.2 million

and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of

$215.6 million

.

•

In June 2016, we issued

$375.0 million

of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of

3.25%

, an effective interest rate of

3.36%

, and mature on June 30, 2026.

•

During June and July 2016, we repaid

$275.0 million

of our

5.95%

senior unsecured notes, which had a scheduled maturity of February 2017.  Through a tender offer we repurchased $72.0 million of the notes and redeemed the remaining outstanding notes, for cash payments totaling

$283.5 million

.  The repayment of these notes resulted in an

$8.8 million

loss on debt extinguishment, which included premiums paid to the holders of the notes as well as the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

•

Throughout 2016, we repaid

seven

secured loans, totaling

$346.7 million

, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of

5.90%

.

•

In October 2016, we redeemed

$129.5 million

of senior unsecured notes, which had a scheduled maturity in August of 2019, for a cash payment of

$154.1 million

.  As the result of this redemption, we recognized a net loss on extinguishment totaling

$25.2 million

, which was comprised of premiums paid to the holders of the notes as well as the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Supplemental Performance Measures

In addition to FFO we use (i) Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ("PNOI") and (ii) Same Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ("SPNOI") as supplemental non-GAAP performance measures.  Management believes that the use of PNOI and SPNOI combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.  The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI and SPNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes.

PNOI and SPNOI each exclude expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP.  Furthermore, these metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis

PNOI is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items. As a performance metric that consists of only the cash-based revenues and expenses directly related to ongoing real estate rental operations, PNOI is narrower in scope than FFO.

PNOI, as we calculate it, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled, but differently calculated, measures for other REITs. We believe that PNOI is another useful supplemental performance measure, as it is an input in many REIT valuation models and it provides a means by which to evaluate the performance of the properties within our Rental Operations segments.

The major factors influencing PNOI are occupancy levels, acquisitions and sales, development properties that achieve stabilized operations, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses.

Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report shows a calculation of our PNOI for the years ended


,


and


and provides a reconciliation of PNOI for our Rental Operations segments to income from continuing operations before income taxes.

-


-

Same Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis

We also evaluate the performance of our properties, including our share of properties we jointly control, on a "same property" basis, using a metric referred to as SPNOI.  We view SPNOI as a useful supplemental performance measure because it improves comparability between periods by eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our portfolio.

On an individual property basis, SPNOI is computed in a consistent manner as PNOI.

We have defined our same property portfolio, for the three and twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

, as those properties that have been owned and in operation throughout the twenty-four months ended

December 31, 2016

.  In addition to excluding properties that have not been owned and in operation for the twenty-four months ended

December 31, 2016

, we have also excluded properties from our same property portfolio where revenues from individual lease buyouts in excess of $250,000 have been recognized.  A reconciliation of income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes to SPNOI is presented as follows (in thousands):

The composition of the line items titled "Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI" and "Non-Segment Items" from the table above are shown in greater detail in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.

We believe the factors that impact SPNOI are generally the same as those that impact PNOI.  The following table details the number of properties, square feet, average occupancy and cash rental rates for the properties included in SPNOI for the respective periods:

Key Performance Indicators

Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our Rental Operations. The following discussion highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider critical drivers of future revenues.

Occupancy Analysis:

As previously discussed, our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue from continuing operations. The following table sets forth percent leased

-


-

and average net effective rent information regarding our in-service portfolio of consolidated rental properties at

December 31, 2016

and


:

The increase in occupancy at

December 31, 2016

, when compared to

December 31, 2015

, was driven by new leasing activity as well as through placing highly leased development projects in service.

Vacancy Activity

The following table sets forth vacancy activity, shown in square feet, from our in-service rental properties included within both continuing and discontinued operations, for the year ended

December 31, 2016

(in thousands):

Total Leasing Activity

The initial leasing of development projects or vacant space in acquired properties is referred to as first generation lease activity. The leasing of such space that we have previously held under lease is referred to as second generation lease activity. The total leasing activity for our consolidated and unconsolidated rental properties, expressed in square feet of leases signed during the period, is as follows for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


(in thousands):

-


-

New Second Generation Leases

The following table sets forth the estimated costs of tenant improvements and leasing commissions, on a per square foot basis, that we are obligated to fulfill under the new second generation leases signed during the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


(square feet data in thousands):

Lease Renewals

The following table summarizes our lease renewal activity within our rental properties for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


(square feet data in thousands):

Lease Expirations

Our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates and net effective rents primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re-lease expiring space. The table below reflects our consolidated in-service portfolio lease expiration

-


-

schedule, excluding the leases in properties designated as held-for-sale, at

December 31, 2016

(in thousands, except percentage data and number of leases):

Information on current market rents can be difficult to obtain, is highly subjective and is often not directly comparable between properties. As a result, we believe the increase or decrease in net effective rent on lease renewals, as previously defined, is the most objective and meaningful relationship between rents on leases expiring in the near-term and current market rents.

Acquisition Activity

Our decision process in determining whether or not to acquire a target property or portfolio involves several factors, including expected rent growth, multiple yield metrics, property locations and expected demographic growth in each location, current occupancy of the target properties, tenant profile and remaining terms of the in-place leases in the target properties. We pursue both brokered and non-brokered acquisitions, and it is difficult to predict which markets and product types may present acquisition opportunities that align with our strategy. Because of the numerous factors considered in our acquisition decisions, we do not establish specific target yields for future acquisitions.  Due to increased market prices and lower acquisition yields for the class and quality of assets that meet our investment criteria, we have shifted our near term focus from acquisitions to new development activities.

In addition to the 14 properties acquired from the Quantico Joint Venture, we also acquired

three

other properties for a total of


properties during the year ended

December 31, 2016

and

two

properties during the year ended

December 31, 2015

.  The following table summarizes the acquisition price, percent leased at time of acquisition and in-place yields by product type for these acquisitions (in thousands, except percentage data):

-


-

Included in the acquisitions noted above is a

$63.0 million

property acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 through a non-monetary distribution of its ownership interest from an unconsolidated joint venture, in connection with that joint venture's dissolution. Please see more details described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report,

Disposition Activity

We regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans.

We sold


buildings during the year ended

December 31, 2016

and


buildings during the year ended

December 31, 2015

.  The following table summarizes the sales prices, in-place yields and percent leased by product type of these buildings (in thousands, except percentage data):

Development

Another source of our earnings growth is our wholly-owned and joint venture development activities.  We expect to generate future earnings from Rental Operations as the development properties are placed in service and leased.

We had

9.4 million

square feet of consolidated or jointly controlled properties under development with total estimated costs upon completion of

$755.2 million

at December 31,


compared to 7.8 million square feet of properties under development with total estimated costs of $730.5 million at December 31,


.

The square footage and estimated costs include both wholly-owned and joint venture development activity at 100%.  The following table summarizes our properties under development at

December 31, 2016

(in thousands, except percentage data):

-


-

We directly own 1,475 acres of undeveloped land, of which we currently intend to develop approximately 1,024 acres.  We believe that the land we intend to develop can support approximately 14.6 million square feet of primarily industrial developments.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31,


to Year Ended December 31,


Rental and Related Revenue

The following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment, as well as total rental and related revenue from discontinued operations, for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively (in thousands):

The primary reason for the

decrease

in rental and related revenue from continuing operations was:

•

The sale of 123 properties since January 1,


, which did not meet the criteria for inclusion within discontinued operations, resulted in a $65.2 million decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended

December 31, 2016

when compared to


.

This

decrease

was substantially offset by the following factors:

•

The acquisition of 19 properties and placing of 44 developments in service from January 1,


to

December 31, 2016

provided combined incremental revenues of $44.8 million in the year ended

December 31, 2016

when compared to


.

•

Average commencement occupancy in the same property portfolio increased by 1.2% in the year ended

December 31, 2016

when compared to


.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations by reportable segment, as well as total rental expenses and real estate taxes from discontinued operations, for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively (in thousands):

-


-

Overall, rental expenses from continuing operations

decreased

by

$18.3 million

in


compared to


. The decrease to rental expenses was primarily the result of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, partially offset by incremental expenses related to developments placed in service and acquisitions.

Real estate taxes from continuing operations

increased

by

$5.8 million

in


compared to


. The increase to real estate taxes was primarily the result of increased real estate taxes for our existing base of properties as well as the impact of the properties acquired and developments placed in service from January 1,


to

December 31, 2016

.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Service Operations

The following table sets forth the components of the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively (in thousands):

Service Operations primarily consist of the leasing, property management, asset management, development, construction management and general contractor services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. Service Operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy, while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners and joint venture partners.

The

decrease

in our earnings from Service Operations in


, as compared to


, was driven by lower overall third-party construction activity due to focusing our resources on wholly-owned development projects.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense slightly

increased

from

$317.3 million

in


to

$317.8 million

in


, as the impact of developments placed in service from January 1,


to

December 31, 2016

was offset by asset dispositions since January 1, 2015 that were not classified within discontinued operations.

-

Equity in Earnings (Loss)

Equity in earnings (loss) represents our ownership share of net income or loss from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that generally own and operate rental properties. Equity in earnings

increased

from a loss of

$3.3 million

in


to earnings of

$47.4 million

in


as the result of significant property sales within our unconsolidated joint ventures during 2016 and the impairment of our investments in certain joint ventures recognized during 2015.

In


, we recorded $31.6 million to equity in earnings related to our share of the gains on sale of joint venture buildings and undeveloped land.

In


, we determined that an other than temporary reduction in value had taken place for three of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, resulting in impairment charges totaling $30.0 million, while our share of gains on sales of properties by unconsolidated joint ventures during


totaled

$13.9 million

.

The most significant of the impairment charges recognized in 2015 pertained to our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (the "Linden joint venture") whose sole asset is undeveloped retail land. The Linden joint venture has not been able to proceed with development of its land as the result of a series of zoning and use-related legal challenges.  During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we changed our strategy such that we now intend to monetize our investment in the joint venture rather than holding for development and continuing to attempt to resolve the legal challenges.  As the result of this change in strategy, we determined that an other-than-temporary decline in the value of our investment in the joint venture had taken place.  During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a

$19.5 million

impairment charge to write our investment in the Linden joint venture to its fair value.

Gain on Sale of Properties - Continuing Operations

We sold


properties during


that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of

$162.1 million

.

We sold


properties during


that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of

$229.7 million

.

Gain on Sale of Land

Gain on sale of land

decreased

from

$35.1 million

in


to

$9.9 million

in


.  We sold 448 acres of undeveloped land in


compared to 502 acres of land in


.

Impairment Charges

Impairment charges classified in continuing operations include the impairment of undeveloped land and buildings.  In


, we recognized impairment charges of

$18.0 million

compared to

$22.9 million

in


.

We recognized impairment charges in both


and


primarily as the result of changes in the intended use for certain of our investments in undeveloped land, where we determined it likely that a near term sale would be executed as opposed to holding the land for development.  We recognized impairment charges of

$14.3 million

, related to


acres of land, during


and

$19.5 million

, related to


acres of land, during


.

We also recognized impairment charges of

$3.7 million

related to

one

building in


and

$3.4 million

related to

two

buildings in


.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist of two components. The first component includes general corporate expenses, and the second component includes the indirect operating costs not allocated to, or absorbed by, the development or Rental Operations of our wholly-owned properties or our Service Operations. The indirect operating costs that are either allocated to, or absorbed by, the development or Rental Operations of our wholly owned properties, or our Service Operations, are primarily comprised of employee compensation, including related

-


-

costs such as benefits and wage-related taxes, but also include other ancillary costs such as travel and information technology support. Total indirect operating costs, prior to any allocation or absorption, and general corporate expenses are collectively referred to as our overall pool of overhead costs.

Those indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. We regularly review our total overhead cost structure relative to our leasing, development and construction volume and adjust the level of total overhead, generally through changes in our level of staffing in various functional departments, as necessary, in order to control overall general and administrative expense.

General and administrative expenses

decreased

from

$58.6 million

in


to

$55.4 million

in


.  The following table sets forth the factors that led to the decrease in general and administrative expenses from


to


(in millions):

(1)   Our total pool of overhead costs decreased between periods, largely due to incurring $7.4 million of overhead restructuring charges in 2015, primarily related to severance costs, as the result of workforce reductions executed primarily in connection with the significant dispositions of office properties that year.

(2)  We capitalized

$24.0 million

and

$25.9 million

of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during


, compared to capitalizing

$21.7 million

and

$23.8 million

of such costs, respectively, for


.  The higher level of overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development activities compared to 2015 was largely the result of increasing the size of our real estate portfolio through largely pre-leased development projects.  Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled

33.5%

and

29.0%

of our overall pool of overhead costs for


and


, respectively.

(3) The decrease in allocation of costs to Service Operations and Rental Operations resulted from a lower volume of third-party construction projects during 2016 as well as a lower allocation of property management and maintenance expenses to Rental Operations due to disposing of substantially all of our investment in office properties through 2015 and 2016 disposition activity.

Interest Expense

Interest expense allocable to continuing operations

decreased

from

$173.6 million

in


to

$141.6 million

in


. The decrease was primarily due to interest savings from the repayment or refinancing of

$784.7 million

of outstanding debt during 2016 as well as realizing a full year of interest savings on the repayment of

$1.11 billion

of outstanding debt during 2015.  We issued

$375.0 million

of

3.25%

unsecured notes during 2016 to refinance higher rate indebtedness.

We capitalized

$16.1 million

of interest costs during


compared to

$16.8 million

during


.

Debt Extinguishment

In June and July 2016, we repaid

$275.0 million

of

5.95%

senior unsecured notes, with a scheduled maturity in February 2017, for cash payments totaling

$283.5 million

. In October 2016, we also redeemed

$129.5 million

in unsecured notes, which had a scheduled maturity in August of 2019, for a cash payment

$154.1 million

.  These transactions resulted in losses on debt extinguishment totaling

$33.9 million

during 2016.

In October 2015, we redeemed

$150.0 million

in unsecured notes that had a scheduled maturity in March of 2016.  In April 2015, we completed a tender offer in which we repurchased

$424.9 million

of our outstanding unsecured notes. We also repaid certain secured loans prior to their scheduled maturity dates during 2015.  These transactions resulted in losses on debt extinguishment totaling

$85.7 million

during


.

Losses on debt extinguishment during both periods were primarily comprised of early repayment premiums as well as the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

-


-

Acquisition-Related Activity

The acquisition-related activity in our consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income consisted of transaction costs for completed acquisitions, which are expensed as incurred, as well as gains or losses related to acquisitions where we had a pre-existing non-controlling ownership interest ("step acquisitions"). For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, acquisition-related activity included a gain of

$7.3 million

related to step acquisitions, which included a gain of

$6.0 million

on the acquisition of the previously mentioned


Quantico Joint Venture properties and a gain of

$1.7 million

on the acquisition of an additional property from an unconsolidated joint venture.

We recognized expense of

$8.5 million

on acquisition related activities during the year ended

December 31, 2015

, which mostly related to an increase to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration from a previous period's real estate portfolio acquisition.

Discontinued Operations

Effective April 1, 2014, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-08 ("ASU 2014-08"), which has resulted in fewer real estate sales being classified within discontinued operations. With the exception of the 61 properties sold as part of the suburban office portfolio sale during 2015, all properties included in discontinued operations at December 31, 2016 were classified as such prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08. Subject to the criteria that was applicable prior to our adoption of ASU 2014-08, the results of operations for most properties that were sold to unrelated parties, or classified as held-for-sale, were required to be classified as discontinued operations. The property-specific components of earnings that were classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes, allocated interest expense and depreciation expense, as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of those properties.

The operations of


buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations for the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  These


buildings consist of


office,


industrial and

two

medical office properties.  As a result, we classified operating income before gain on sales of

$991,000

,

$10.9 million

and

$11.1 million

in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively.

Of these properties, no properties were sold during


,


properties were sold during


and


properties were sold during


. The gains on disposal of these properties, net of tax, totaling

$1.0 million

,

$421.7 million

and

$19.8 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively, are also reported in discontinued operations. There were no properties classified as held-for-sale and included in discontinued operations at

December 31, 2016

Comparison of Year Ended December 31,


to Year Ended December 31,


Rental and Related Revenue

The following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment, as well as total rental and related revenue from discontinued operations, for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively (in thousands):

The primary reason for the decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations was:

•

The sale of 108 properties since January 1, 2014, which did not meet the criteria for inclusion within discontinued operations, resulted in a $77.1 million decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to 2014.

This decrease was substantially offset by the following factors:

•

We acquired seven properties, of which six were industrial and one was medical office, and placed 46 developments in service from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. These acquisitions and developments provided combined incremental revenues of $48.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to 2014.

•

Average commencement occupancy in our same property portfolio increased by 1.6% in the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to 2014.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations by reportable segment, as well as total rental expenses and real estate taxes from discontinued operations, for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively (in thousands):

-


-

Rental expenses from continuing operations

decreased

by

$10.6 million

in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease to rental expenses was primarily the result of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, partially offset by incremental expenses related to acquisitions, developments placed in service and the impact of increased occupancy.

Real estate taxes from continuing operations

decreased

by

$2.1 million

in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease to real estate taxes was primarily the result of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, partially offset by incremental expenses related to acquisitions, developments placed in service and the impact of increased tax assessments among our existing base of properties.

Service Operations

The following table sets forth the components of the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively (in thousands):

The decrease in our earnings from Service Operations in 2015, as compared to 2014, was driven by lower overall third-party construction volume as well as two third-party construction projects with higher than normal profit margins during 2014.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased from

$346.3 million

in 2014 to

$317.3 million

in 2015, primarily as the result of asset dispositions since January 1, 2014 that were not classified within discontinued operations. The reduction to depreciation expense was also driven, to a lesser extent, by shorter-lived assets from previous periods' acquisitions becoming fully depreciated.

Equity in Earnings

Equity in earnings decreased from $94.3 million in 2014 to a loss of $3.3 million in 2015 as the result of significant property sales within unconsolidated joint ventures during 2014 and the impairment of our investments in certain joint ventures recognized during 2015.

In 2015, we determined that an other than temporary reduction in value had taken place for three of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, resulting in impairment charges totaling $30.0 million, while our share of gains on sales of properties by unconsolidated joint ventures during 2015 totaled $13.9 million.

The most significant of the impairment charges recognized in 2015 pertained to a change in strategy in the fourth quarter of 2015 to monetize our investment in the Linden joint venture rather than holding for development.  As the result of this change in strategy, we determined that an other-than-temporary decline in the value of our investment in the joint venture had taken place.  During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $19.5 million impairment charge to write our investment in the Linden joint venture to its fair value.

Our share of the gains on sale of properties by unconsolidated joint ventures during 2014 totaled $84.6 million.  The most significant sale by our unconsolidated joint ventures during 2014 was of an office tower in Atlanta, Georgia, for which our share of the gain on sale totaled $58.6 million.

We sold 91 properties during 2015 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $229.7 million.

-


-

We sold 17 properties during 2014 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $162.7 million.

Gain on Sale of Land

Gain on sale of land increased from $10.4 million in 2014 to $35.1 million in 2015. We sold 502 acres of undeveloped land in 2015 compared to 174 acres of land in 2014.

Impairment Charges

In 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $22.9 million compared to $49.1 million in 2014.

We recognized impairment charges in both 2014 and 2015 as the result of changes in the intended use for certain of our investments in undeveloped land, where we determined it likely that a near term sale would be executed as opposed to holding the land for development.  We recognized impairment charges of $19.5 million, related to 139 acres of land, during 2015 and $33.7 million, related to 442 acres of land, during 2014.

As the result of changes in strategy, where we determined we would execute a sale within the relatively near future as opposed to holding for long-term investment, we also recognized impairment charges of $3.4 million related to two buildings in 2015 and $15.4 million related to six buildings in 2014.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased from $49.4 million in 2014 to $58.6 million in 2015.  The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2014 to 2015 (in millions):

(1)   Our total pool of overhead costs decreased between periods, largely due to lower salary and related costs, as the result of workforce reductions executed primarily in connection with the significant decrease in our investment in office properties that occurred in connection with the significant dispositions of office properties in early April 2015.

(2) We recognized approximately $7.4 million of overhead restructuring charges, primarily related to severance costs, during 2015, related to the workforce reductions that took place during the year.

(3)  We capitalized $21.7 million and $23.8 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during 2015, compared to capitalizing $23.9 million and $28.8 million of such costs, respectively, for 2014.  The lower level of overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development activities was largely the result of owning fewer properties due to the significant property dispositions executed during 2015.  Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 29.0% and 31.4% of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(4) The decrease in allocation of costs to Service Operations and Rental Operations resulted from a lower volume of third-party construction projects during 2015 as well as a lower allocation of property management and maintenance expenses to Rental Operations due to significantly decreasing our investment in office properties through 2015 disposition activity.

Interest Expense

Interest expense allocable to continuing operations

decreased

from

$196.2 million

in 2014 to

$173.6 million

in 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of $1.11 billion of outstanding debt during 2015 as well as due to a lower overall weighted average cost of borrowing compared to 2014.

We capitalized $16.8 million of interest costs during 2015 compared to $17.6 million during 2014.

Debt Extinguishment

In October 2015, we redeemed $150.0 million in unsecured notes that had a scheduled maturity in March of 2016.  In April 2015, we completed a tender offer in which we repurchased $424.9 million of our outstanding unsecured notes.  We also repaid certain secured loans prior to their scheduled maturity dates during 2015.  We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $85.7 million from these transactions during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $283,000 during 2014, which included make-whole payments, repurchase premiums, prepayment premiums as well as the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Acquisition-Related Activity

Acquisition-related activity increased from an expense of $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to an expense of $8.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.  Substantially all of the activity in 2015 was driven by an increase to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration that relates to a previous period's acquisition.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience.  Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our Audit Committee and independent auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:

Accounting for Joint Ventures:

We analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity ("VIE") and would require consolidation. We (i) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity investment at risk, (ii) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group and whether there are limited partners (or similar owning entities) that lack substantive participating or kick out rights, guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (iii) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this VIE determination. To the extent that we own interests in a VIE and we (i) are the sole entity that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE and (ii) have the obligation or rights to absorb the VIE's losses or receive its benefits, then we would be determined to be the primary beneficiary and would consolidate the VIE.  To the extent we own interests in a VIE, then at each reporting period, we re-assess our conclusions as to which, if any, party within the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary.  To the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as VIEs, we further assess each partner's substantive participating rights to determine if the venture should be consolidated.

We have equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. To the extent applicable, we consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. For non-variable interest entities, we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing entity and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day-to-day operations, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner. We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the

-


-

basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in earnings of the joint venture. We recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner's interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value.

Cost Capitalization

: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.

We also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods, after construction of the building shell has been completed, if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy. In addition, all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized.

In assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction, development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.

To ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease. These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized.

Impairment of Real Estate Assets:

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

-


-

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset's undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.

To the extent applicable marketplace data is available, we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired.

Real estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

Acquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets:

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant.  This “as-if vacant” value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties.  The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, discount rate, estimated market rents, and hypothetical expected lease-up periods.

The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases.

•

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

•

Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical lease up periods, related to space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition.  These estimates include (i) lost rent at market rates, (ii) fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and (iii) theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.

We record assets acquired in step acquisitions at their full fair value and record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our existing equity interest. Additionally, contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.

Construction Contracts

: We recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method. Using this method, profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts. A portion of the estimated profits is recognized based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract. To the extent that a fixed-price contract is estimated to result in a loss, the loss is recorded immediately. Cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract's term. This revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months, including maturities of indebtedness, payments of dividends and distributions and the capital expenditures needed to maintain our current real estate assets, primarily through working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds received from real estate dispositions.  At December 31,


we held

$12.6 million

of cash and we had

$48.0 million

of outstanding borrowings on the Partnership's

$1.20 billion

unsecured line of credit.

In addition to our existing sources of liquidity, we expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and other capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow, proceeds from property dispositions and through accessing the public debt and equity markets.

Rental Operations

Cash flows from Rental Operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable source of cash flow to fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for items such as periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of, or a short time following, the actual revenue recognition.

We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and bankruptcies and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, any of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations.

Unsecured Debt and Equity Securities

Our unsecured line of credit at

December 31, 2016

is described as follows (in thousands):

The Partnership's unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of

$1.20 billion

with the interest rate on borrowings of LIBOR plus

0.93%

(equal to

1.70%

for outstanding borrowings at

December 31, 2016

), which is a decrease from a rate of

LIBOR

plus

1.05%

at December 31, 2015 due to an upgrade in our credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service from Baa2 to Baa1and Standard and Poor's Financial Services from BBB to BBB+.  The Partnership's unsecured line of credit has a maturity date of

January 2019

, but may be extended by one year at our option.  Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional

$400.0 million

, for a total of up to

$1.60 billion

.  This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At

December 31, 2016

, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

-


-

At

December 31, 2016

, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities (including guarantees of the Partnership's debt securities by the General Partner). Equity securities are offered and sold by the General Partner, and the net proceeds of such offerings are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units or Preferred Units. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes.

The General Partner's previous ATM equity program, which allowed it to issue new common shares from time to time, was fully utilized in July 2016.  On August 9, 2016, the General Partner entered into a new ATM equity program that allows it to issue new common shares from time to time, with an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 million.  During


, the General Partner issued a total of

8.4 million

common shares pursuant to both of its ATM equity programs (including 5.1 million common shares under its old program and 3.3 million common shares under its new program) with an average issuance price of $25.93 per share, generating gross proceeds of approximately

$218.2 million

, and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of approximately

$215.6 million

.  As of

December 31, 2016

, the new ATM equity program had $108.1 million of remaining capacity.

In June 2016, we issued

$375.0 million

of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated rate of 3.25%, have an effective interest rate of 3.36%, and mature on June 30, 2026.

The Partnership has issued debt securities pursuant to certain indentures and related supplemental indentures, which also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants, as well as applicable covenants under our unsecured line of credit, at

December 31, 2016

.

Sale of Real Estate Assets

We regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of non-strategic properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. Although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non-strategic properties, potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties. Sales of land and depreciated property provided

$538.6 million

in net proceeds in


, compared to

$1.68 billion

in


and

$493.2 million

in


.

Transactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Transactions with unconsolidated joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity.  From time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated joint ventures, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own.  Additionally, unconsolidated joint ventures will from time to time obtain debt financing or sell properties and will then distribute to us, and our joint venture partners, all, or a portion of the proceeds from such transactions. During


, our share of sale and financing distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures totaled

$126.1 million

.

Uses of Liquidity

Our principal uses of liquidity include the following:

•

property investment;

•

leasing/capital costs;

•

dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;

•

long-term debt maturities;

•

opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt; and

•

other contractual obligations.

Property Investment

Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties in both existing and select new markets and to continue to increase our investment in on-campus or hospital affiliated medical office properties. Pursuant to this strategy, we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon our market outlook, including general economic conditions, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, and our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity, including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties.

Leasing/Capital Costs

Tenant improvements and lease-related costs pertaining to our initial leasing of newly completed space, or vacant space in acquired properties, are referred to as first generation expenditures. Such first generation expenditures for tenant improvements are included within "development of real estate investments" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while such expenditures for lease-related costs are included within "other deferred leasing costs."

Cash expenditures related to the construction of a building's shell, as well as the associated site improvements, are also included within "development of real estate investments" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Tenant improvements and leasing costs to re-let rental space that we previously leased to tenants are referred to as second generation expenditures.  Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant, but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties, are also second generation expenditures.  One of the principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments.

The following table summarizes our second generation capital expenditures by type of expenditure, as well as capital expenditures for the development of real estate investments and for other deferred leasing costs (in thousands):

Second generation capital expenditures were significantly lower during 2016 and 2015, compared to 2014, as the result of significant dispositions of office properties, which were more capital intensive to re-lease than industrial properties.

We had wholly owned properties under development with an expected cost of

$713.1 million

at

December 31, 2016

, compared to projects with an expected cost of $599.8 million and $470.2 million at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.

The capital expenditures in the table above include the capitalization of internal overhead costs.  We capitalized

$24.0 million

,

$21.7 million

and

$23.9 million

of overhead costs related to leasing activities, including both first and second generation leases, during the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  We capitalized

$25.9 million

,

$23.8 million

and

$28.8 million

of overhead costs related to development activities, including both development and tenant improvement projects on first and second generation space, during the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled

33.5%

,

29.0%

and

31.4%

of our overall pool of overhead costs at

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively. Further discussion of the capitalization of overhead costs can be found in the year-to-year comparisons of general and administrative expenses and Critical Accounting Policies sections of this Item 7.

-


-

In addition to the capitalization of overhead costs the totals for development of real estate assets in the table above include the capitalization of

$16.1 million

,

$16.8 million

and

$17.6 million

of interest costs in the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.

Dividend and Distribution Requirements

The General Partner is required to meet the distribution requirements of the Code, in order to maintain its REIT status. We paid regular dividends or distributions of

$0.73

, $0.69 and $0.68 per common share or Common Unit for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  We also paid a one-time special dividend of $0.20 in December of 2015 as a result of the significant taxable gains on asset sales completed in 2015.

We expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings, to meet the requirements to maintain the General Partner's REIT status, and additional amounts as determined by the General Partner's board of directors. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the General Partner's board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as the General Partner's board of directors deems relevant.

Debt Maturities

Debt outstanding at

December 31, 2016

had a face value totaling

$2.93 billion

with a weighted average interest rate of

4.47%

and maturities at various dates through 2028. Of this total amount, we had

$2.50 billion

of unsecured debt,

$384.4 million

of secured debt and

$48.0 million

outstanding on our unsecured line of credit at

December 31, 2016

.  Scheduled principal amortization, maturities and early repayments of such debt totaled

$784.7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

The following table is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at

December 31, 2016

(in thousands, except percentage data):

The Partnership's variable rate unsecured notes and unsecured line of credit are both reflected in the table above as maturing in January 2020, based on the ability to exercise a one-year extension option from their stated maturity dates of January 2019.  We anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from our Rental Operations and property dispositions and by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions.

Repurchases of Outstanding Debt

To the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy, we may purchase some of our outstanding unsecured notes prior to their stated maturities.

-


-

In June and July 2016, we repaid

$275.0 million

of

5.95%

unsecured notes scheduled to mature in February 2017, for cash payments totaling

$283.5 million

, which resulted in an

$8.8 million

loss on debt extinguishment.

In October 2016, we redeemed

$129.5 million

of unsecured notes that had a scheduled maturity in August of 2019.  We recognized a net loss on the extinguishment of these notes in the fourth quarter totaling

$25.2 million

.

Guarantee Obligations

We are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments.

Historical Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents were $

12.6 million

, $

22.5 million

and

$17.9 million

at

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, respectively. The following table highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our Rental Operations and Service Operations activities. The receipt of rental income from Rental Operations continues to be our primary source of operating cash flows.   The increase to cash flow provided by operating activities, compared to 2015, was due to lower cash paid for interest, as the result of the significant debt repayments that took place during 2015 and 2016, newly developed properties being placed in service and improved operational performance.

The decrease in cash flows from operations between 2014 and 2015 was the result of owning fewer properties due to the major dispositions completed throughout 2015 and the latter part of 2014.  This reduction to operating cash flows from Rental Operations was partially offset by lower interest costs that resulted from using the proceeds from property dispositions to pay down significant amounts of debt in 2015.

Investing Activities

Investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity. Development and acquisition activities typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:

•

Real estate development costs were

$401.4 million

,

$370.5 million

, and

$446.7 million

during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. During 2016, we placed 21 newly completed wholly-owned development projects in service and expect to continue with a robust level of new development.

•

We paid cash of

$269.8 million

,

$68.7 million

and

$193.4 million

, respectively, for real estate and undeveloped land acquisitions during


,


and


, respectively.

•

Sales of land and depreciated property generated net proceeds of

$538.6 million

,

$1.68 billion

and

$493.2 million

during


,


and


, respectively.

•

Second generation tenant improvements, leasing costs and building improvements totaled

$59.3 million

,

$61.9 million

and

$98.8 million

during


,


and


, respectively. The second generation capital

-


-

expenditures continued to decrease in


primarily due to the disposition of remaining office properties that generally have higher re-leasing costs than industrial properties do.

•

During 2016, we also received a full repayment of a $200.0 million seller financed mortgage from the buyers of an office portfolio that we sold in April 2015.

•

We received capital distributions from unconsolidated companies as a result of the sale of properties or refinancing of

$126.1 million

,

$69.0 million

and

$91.8 million

during


,


and


, respectively.

•

We made capital contributions and advances to unconsolidated companies in the amounts of

$57.9 million

,

$72.4 million

and

$11.6 million

Impact of Changes in Credit Ratings on Our Liquidity

We are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group.  Our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service, upgraded in 2016 from Baa2.  In addition, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, upgraded in 2016 from BBB.

The ratings of our senior unsecured notes could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and none of our outstanding interest rate swaps were significant to any period presented in this report.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in Unconsolidated Companies

We have equity interests in unconsolidated partnerships and limited liability companies that primarily own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. These unconsolidated joint ventures are primarily engaged in the operations and development of industrial and medical office real estate properties. These investments provide us with increased market share and tenant and property diversification. The equity method of accounting (see Critical Accounting Policies) is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies. As a result, the assets and liabilities of these entities are not included on our balance sheet.

Our investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries represents approximately

3%

and

4%

of our total assets for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

.  We believe that these investments provide several benefits to us, including increased market share, tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects.

The following table presents summarized financial information for unconsolidated companies for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that have been established solely for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual Obligations

At

December 31, 2016

, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the following table:

-


-

(1)

Our long-term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest.  Interest payments for variable rate debt were calculated using the interest rates as of

December 31, 2016

. Repayment of our

$250.0 million

variable rate term note, which has a contractual maturity date in

January 2019

, is reflected as a 2020 obligation in the table above based on the ability to exercise a one-year extension, which we may exercise at our discretion.

(2)

Our unsecured line of credit has a contractual maturity date in

January 2019

, but is reflected as a 2020 obligation in the table above based on the ability to exercise a one-year extension, which we may exercise at our discretion. Interest payments for our unsecured line of credit were calculated using the most recent stated interest rate that was in effect.

(3)

Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at

December 31, 2016

.

(4)

Represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of owned development projects and third-party construction projects.

Related Party Transactions

We provide property and asset management, leasing, construction and other tenant-related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests. For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


we earned management fees of

$4.5 million

,

$6.8 million

and

$8.5 million

, leasing fees of

$2.4 million

,

$3.0 million

and

$3.4 million

and construction and development fees of

$8.0 million

,

$6.1 million

and

$5.8 million

, respectively, from these companies, prior to elimination of our ownership percentage. We recorded these fees based on contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services and have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

The partnership has guaranteed the repayment of

$32.9 million

of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

The Partnership also has guaranteed the repayment of an unsecured loan of

one

of our unconsolidated subsidiaries. At

December 31, 2016

, the maximum guarantee exposure for this loan was approximately

$52.1 million

.

We lease certain land positions with terms extending to

March 2114

, with a total future payment obligation of

$311.1 million

. The payments on these ground leases, which are classified as operating leases, are not material in any individual year.

In addition to ground leases, we are party to other operating leases as part of conducting our business, including leases of office space from third parties, with a total future payment obligation of

$43.4 million

at December 31, 2016.  No future payments on these leases are material in any individual year.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

We own certain parcels of land that are subject to special property tax assessments levied by quasi municipal entities. To the extent that such special assessments are fixed and determinable, the discounted value of the full

-


-

assessment is recorded as a liability.  We have

$10.2 million

of such special assessment liabilities, which are included within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, as of

December 31, 2016

.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long-term borrowings. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed rates.  We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. We have one outstanding swap, which fixes the rates on one of our variable rate loans, and is not significant to our financial statements at

December 31, 2016

.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts (in thousands) of the expected annual maturities, weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period, fair values (in thousands) and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.

The Partnership's variable rate unsecured notes and unsecured line of credit are both reflected in the table above as maturing in January 2020, based on the ability to exercise a one-year extension option from their stated maturity dates of January 2019.

As the above table incorporates only those exposures that existed at

December 31, 2016

, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, the ultimate impact of interest rate fluctuations will depend on future exposures that arise, our hedging strategies at that time, to the extent we are party to interest rate derivatives, and interest rates. Interest expense on our unsecured line of credit, to the extent we have outstanding borrowings, and our variable rate unsecured notes will be affected by fluctuations in the LIBOR indices as well as changes in our credit rating. The interest rate at such point in the future as we may renew, extend or replace our unsecured line of credit will be heavily dependent upon the state of the credit environment.

At

December 31, 2016

, the face value of our unsecured debt was

$2.50 billion

and we estimated the fair value of that unsecured debt to be

$2.57 billion

. At

December 31, 2015

, the face value of our unsecured debt was

$2.53 billion

and our estimate of the fair value of that debt was

$2.62 billion

.

Management's Report on Internal Control

We, as management of Duke Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "General Partner"), are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of

December 31, 2016

, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.

The independent registered public accounting firm of KPMG LLP, as auditors of the General Partner's consolidated financial statements, has also issued an audit report on the General Partner's internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Shareholders and Directors of

Duke Realty Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2016

. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule III. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2016

, in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule III, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for Discontinued Operations in 2014 due to the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2014-08,

Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Duke Realty Limited Partnership and Subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2016

, in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule III, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, Duke Realty Limited Partnership and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Partnership has changed its method of accounting for Discontinued Operations in 2014 due to the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2014-08,

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company

The General Partner was formed in 1985, and we believe that it qualifies as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. The Partnership was formed on October 4, 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest, whose operations began in 1972.

The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning approximately

99.0%

of the Common Units at

December 31, 2016

. The remaining

1.0%

of the Common Units are owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Partnership, the General Partner has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Partnership. The General Partner and the Partnership are operated as one enterprise. The management of the General Partner consists of the same members as the management of the Partnership. As the sole general partner with control of the Partnership, the General Partner consolidates the Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same.

Limited Partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner.

We own and operate a portfolio primarily consisting of industrial and medical office properties and provide real estate services to third-party owners. Substantially all of our Rental Operations (see Note 8) are conducted through the Partnership. We conduct our Service Operations (see Note 8) through Duke Realty Services, LLC, Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited Partnership ("DCLP"), which are consolidated entities that are 100% owned by a combination of the General Partner and the Partnership. DCLP is owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. The equity interests in these controlled subsidiaries not owned by us are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Investments in entities that we do not control, and VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary, are not consolidated and are reflected as investments in unconsolidated companies under the equity method of reporting.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

("ASU 2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the existing variable interest entity guidance. We adopted ASU 2015-02 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and it has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

As the result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02, which stipulates that limited partnerships (and similar entities) where the limited partners do not have substantive participating or kick-out rights are VIEs, we determined that the

-


-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Partnership is a VIE. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, the General Partner consolidated the Partnership pursuant to the voting interest model. We concluded that, because it holds majority ownership and exercises control over every aspect of the Partnership's operations, the General Partner is the primary beneficiary of the Partnership and, as such, will continue to consolidate the Partnership.

The assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same, as the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the


consolidated financial statement presentation as the result of recently effective accounting pronouncements.

Real Estate Investments

Rental real property, including land, land improvements, buildings and tenant improvements, are included in real estate investments and are generally stated at cost. Construction in process and undeveloped land are included in real estate investments and are stated at cost. Real estate investments also include our equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development.

Depreciation

Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated lives not to exceed


and


years, respectively, for properties that we develop, and not to exceed


and


years, respectively, for acquired properties. Tenant improvement costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or term of the related lease.

Cost Capitalization

Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. In addition, all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized. We capitalize a portion of our indirect costs associated with our construction, development and leasing efforts. In assessing the amount of direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. We do not capitalize any costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In addition, we capitalize costs, including real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, that have been allocated to vacant space based on the square footage of the portion of the building not held available for immediate occupancy during the extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized.

We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods when significant activities have ceased, which does not exceed the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.

Impairment

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market

-


-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. We utilize marketplace participant assumptions to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is required to be measured. The estimation of future cash flows, as well as the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach, are highly subjective measures in estimating fair value.

Real estate assets classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Once a property is designated as held-for-sale, no further depreciation expense is recorded.

Purchase Accounting

Generally, our acquisitions are of operating properties that meet the definition of a business.  To the extent an acquired property meets the definition of a business, then we expense acquisition related costs immediately as period costs.

To the extent that we gain control of an asset through a step acquisition, which meets the definition of a business, we record the acquired asset at its full fair value and record a gain or loss, within acquisition-related activity in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our pre-existing equity interest.

Contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties that meet the definition of a business to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant. This “as-if vacant” value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties.  The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, discount rate, estimated market rents and hypothetical expected lease-up periods. The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases as well as, to the extent applicable,

acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value. There have been no customer relationship intangible assets related to any of our acquisitions to date.

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, of space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition, of lost rent at market rates, fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and theoretical leasing commissions required to execute

similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.

In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-16,

Business Combinations - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

("ASU 2015-16"), which amends the retroactive requirement to apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  ASU 2015-16 was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted ASU 2015-16 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and it has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Joint Ventures

We have equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that primarily own and operate rental properties or hold land for development. We consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is considered a VIE and would require consolidation. We (i) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity investment at risk, (ii) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group and whether there are limited partners (or similar owning entities) that lack substantive participating or kick out rights, guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (iii) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this VIE determination.

To the extent that we own interests in a VIE and we (i) are the sole entity that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE and (ii) have the obligation or rights to absorb the VIE's losses or receive its benefits, then we would be determined to be the primary beneficiary and would consolidate the VIE.  To the extent that we own interests in a VIE, then at each reporting period, we re-assess our conclusions as to which, if any, party within the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary.

To the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as VIEs, they are consolidated if we control them through majority ownership interests or if we are the managing entity (general partner or managing member) and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by our ability to unilaterally make significant operating decisions, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the non-managing entity and the inability of the non-managing entity to remove us from our role as the managing entity.  Consolidated joint ventures that are not VIEs are not significant in any period presented in these consolidated financial statements.

We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we exercise significant influence but do not have control. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. We recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner's interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary.  If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

There were no unconsolidated joint ventures, in which we have any recognized assets or liabilities or have retained any economic exposure to loss at

December 31, 2016

that met the criteria to be considered VIEs.

Cash Equivalents

Investments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Valuation of Receivables

We reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90 days. Additional reserves are recorded for more current amounts, as applicable, where we have determined collectability to be doubtful. Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant with long-term risk, regardless of the status of current rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

Deferred Costs

Deferred Financing Costs

Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are deferred and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related loan. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,

Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

("ASU 2015-03"). The standard requires the costs for issuing debt to appear on a balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt's value. ASU 2015-03 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016 and was applied retrospectively. We adopted ASU 2015-03 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and it has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Debt issuance costs related to the Partnership's unsecured line of credit continue to be presented as assets in the consolidated balance sheets, as part of escrow deposits and other assets, pursuant to ASU 2015-15

, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.

Lease Related Costs and Acquired Lease-Related Intangible Assets

All direct and indirect costs, including estimated internal costs, associated with the leasing of real estate investments owned by us are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease. We include lease incentive costs, which are payments made on behalf of a tenant to sign a lease, in deferred leasing costs and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms as a reduction of rental revenues. We include as lease incentives amounts funded to construct tenant improvements owned by the tenant. Unamortized costs are charged to expense upon the early termination of the lease or upon early payment of the financing.

Acquired lease-related intangible assets consist of above market lease assets and the value allocable to in-place leases. Above market lease assets are amortized as a reduction to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. In-place lease intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and included within depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

The expected future amortization, or charge to rental income, of acquired lease-related intangible assets is summarized in the table below (in thousands):

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests relate to the minority ownership interests in the Partnership and interests in consolidated property partnerships that are not wholly-owned by the General Partner or the Partnership. Noncontrolling interests are subsequently adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to noncontrolling holders and the noncontrolling holders' proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity. We report noncontrolling interests as a component of total equity.

When a Common Unit of the Partnership is redeemed (Note 1), the change in ownership is treated as an equity transaction by the General Partner and there is no effect on its earnings or net assets.

Revenue Recognition

Rental and Related Revenue

The timing of revenue recognition under an operating lease is determined based upon ownership of the tenant improvements. If we are the owner of the tenant improvements, revenue recognition commences after the improvements are completed and the tenant takes possession or control of the space. If we determine that the tenant allowances or improvements we are funding are lease incentives, then we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant. Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis.

We record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any material conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us.

General Contractor and Service Fee Revenue

Management fees are based on a percentage of rental receipts of properties managed and are recognized as the rental receipts are collected. Maintenance fees are based upon established hourly rates and are recognized as the services are performed. Construction management and development fees represent fee-based third-party contracts and are recognized as earned based on the percentage of completion method.

We recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method. Using this method, profits are recorded based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under the contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. Changes in job performance, job conditions and

Under billed and over billed receivables on construction contracts totaled

$1.1 million

, respectively, at

and

$5.5 million

and

$1.1 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2015

.  Over billed receivables are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Property Sales

Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations (for example, a disposal of a major geographic area or a major line of business) should be presented as discontinued operations, while significant continuing involvement with such dispositions no longer preclude discontinued operations classification. ASU 2014-08 was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted only for disposals or classifications as held-for-sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.  We adopted ASU 2014-08 early and have applied it since April 1, 2014.

Gains on sales of all properties are recognized in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 360-20 ("ASC 360-20"). The specific timing of the sale of a building is measured against various criteria in ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance from the seller associated with the properties. We make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize considering factors such as continuing ownership interest we may have with the buyer ("partial sales") and our level of future involvement with the property or the buyer that acquires the assets. If the full accrual sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the full accrual sales criteria are met. Estimated future costs to be incurred after completion of each sale are included in the determination of the gain on sales.

Net Income Per Common Share or Common Unit

Basic net income per common share or Common Unit is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders, less dividends or distributions on share-based awards expected to vest (referred to as "participating securities" and primarily composed of unvested restricted stock units), by the weighted average number of common shares or Common Units outstanding for the period.

Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the sum of net income attributable to common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in earnings allocable to Limited Partner Units (to the extent the Limited Partner Units are dilutive), less dividends or distributions on participating securities that are anti-dilutive, by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, to the extent they are dilutive, weighted average number of Limited Partner Units outstanding and any potential dilutive securities for the period. Diluted net income per Common Unit is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common unitholders, less dividends or distributions on participating securities that are anti-dilutive, by the sum of the weighted average number of Common Units outstanding and any potential dilutive securities for the period.

Federal Income Taxes

General Partner

The General Partner has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, as amended. To qualify as a REIT, the General Partner must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders. Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to maintain the General Partner's REIT status. As a REIT, the General Partner is entitled to a tax deduction for the dividends it pays to shareholders. Accordingly, the General Partner generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as it currently distributes to shareholders an amount equal to or in excess of its taxable income. The General Partner is, however, generally subject to federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to its shareholders. If the General Partner fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.

REIT qualification reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of state and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a dividends paid deduction and are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.  As a REIT, the General Partner may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes if it engages in certain types of transactions.

Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of taxable income under our current operating strategy, management believes that it is more likely than not that the taxable REIT subsidiary will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize any of its deferred tax assets.

Fair Value Measurements

We follow the framework established under accounting standard FASB ASC 820 for measuring fair value of non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis but only in certain circumstances, such as a business combination.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to which we have access.

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

In addition to the acquired properties discussed in Note 3, assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements consisted of real estate assets, both buildings and undeveloped land, that were determined to be impaired and recorded at fair value as discussed in Note 6. The table below aggregates the total fair value of these impaired assets as determined during the years ended

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Business Combinations

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,

Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business

("ASU 2017-01"). ASU 2017-01 provides revised guidance to determine when an acquisition meets the definition of a business or should be accounted for as an asset acquisition. ASU 2017-01 requires that when substantially all of the fair value of an acquisition is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets it does not meet the definition of a business. ASU 2017-01 also revises the definition of a business to include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. ASU 2017-01 will be effective, on a prospective basis, for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for acquisition transactions that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. We believe that, after the adoption of ASU 2017-01, most of our building acquisitions will not meet the definition of a business, and that third-party transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions will be capitalized. We plan to adopt ASU 2017-01 early, prospectively for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  We do not believe that the adoption of ASU 2017-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash

("ASU 2016-18"). ASU 2016-18 requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 will be effective for us retrospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. We do not believe ASU 2016-18 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flow

s ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows and how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for us retrospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. We do not believe ASU 2016-15 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Stock Compensation

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (

"ASU 2016-09"

),

which simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, forfeitures and the classification of shares withheld to cover employee tax payments in the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the implementation of ASU 2016-09 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

Leases

("ASU 2016-02"), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). ASU 2016-02 supersedes existing leasing standards.

ASU 2016-02 requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 also requires that lessors expense certain initial direct costs, which are capitalizable under existing leasing standards, as incurred.

ASU 2016-02 also specifies that payments for certain lease-related services, which are often included in lease agreements, represent "non-lease" components that will become subject to the guidance in ASU 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

when ASU 2016-02 becomes effective.

ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. ASU 2016-02 will impact the accounting and disclosure requirements for the ground leases, and other operating leases, where we are the lessee.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ASU 2016-02 will be effective for us under a modified retrospective approach for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  A set of practical expedients for implementation, which must be elected as a package and for all leases, may also be elected. These practical expedients include relief from re-assessing lease classification at the adoption date for expired or existing leases, although a right-of-use asset and lease liability would still be recorded for such leases.  We are currently assessing the method of adoption and the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

("ASU 2014-09").  ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing GAAP revenue recognition guidance as well as impact the existing GAAP guidance governing the sale of non-financial assets. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it satisfies performance obligations, by transferring promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for fulfilling those performance obligations.  In doing so, companies will need to exercise more judgment and make more estimates than under existing GAAP guidance.

ASU 2014-09 also created guidance governing the sale of non-financial assets with customers and non-customers with the only difference in the treatment of these transactions in the statement of operations (i.e., revenue and expense when the sale is to a customer and net gain or loss when the sale is to a non-customer).  Based on the nature of our business, we believe that our property sales represent transactions with non-customers.  ASU 2014-09 may also impact the timing of recognizing sales of non-financial assets as compared to existing GAAP guidance.

ASU 2014-09 will be effective for public entities for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted in periods ending after December 15, 2016. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full or modified retrospective ("cumulative effect") adoption.  We have tentatively concluded that we will adopt ASU 2014-09 using the cumulative effect method.

We have begun to evaluate each of our revenue streams under the new standard and the pattern of recognition is not expected to change significantly. Additionally, we have primarily disposed of property and land in all cash transactions with no contingencies and no future involvement in the operations, and therefore, do not expect the new standard to significantly impact the recognition of property and land sales.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

Acquisitions and dispositions for the periods presented were completed in accordance with our strategy to reposition our investment concentration among the product types and markets in which we operate. With the exception of certain properties that have been sold or classified as held for sale, the results of operations for all acquired properties have been included in continuing operations within our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.

Quantico Joint Venture Properties

In the fourth quarter of 2016, pursuant to a pre-existing purchase option, we acquired


properties in the Washington D.C. area from the Quantico Joint Venture in which we had a pre-existing equity ownership interest.  These


properties were comprised of


industrial properties and

three

office properties. These


properties were previously encumbered by a

$131.3 million

CMBS loan and, pursuant to the terms of the purchase option, we repaid the loan as consideration for the acquisition of the underlying properties.

We recognized a gain on this step-acquisition equal to the excess of the fair value of our pre-existing equity ownership interest in the acquired assets over the carrying value of our investment in those assets.  The carrying value of our investment was

zero

as the result of accumulated operating losses at the joint venture level.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of the


properties acquired was internally determined, primarily using an income approach, and based upon Level 3 inputs, as previously defined. The inputs used in determining the fair value of the acquired properties, as well as allocating that fair value to the individual components of the real estate assets acquired, are disclosed hereafter in the Fair Value Measurements section of this note. The following table summarizes the fair value of the amounts recognized for each major class of assets for this acquisition as well as the computation of the gain on acquisition (in thousands):

We had previously accounted for our interest in these


properties using the equity method. No goodwill or gain on bargain purchase was recognized in connection with this transaction. We sold

one

of the acquired properties, a

241,000

square foot office property, immediately following the acquisition for net proceeds of

$53.4 million

, which we also used as the determination of that property's fair value.

Distribution of Joint Venture Properties

Included in our property acquisitions for the year ended

December 31, 2016

was an industrial property that we received as part of a non-cash distribution of properties from Duke/Hulfish LLC ("Duke/Hulfish"), a

20%

owned unconsolidated joint venture.  On June 30, 2016, as part of a plan of dissolution, Duke/Hulfish distributed its ownership in

seven

properties to our partner in the joint venture while distributing its ownership interest in

one

property to us.  We also received

$2.8 million

in cash from the joint venture in order to balance the value of the distributions received in accordance with the applicable ownership percentages.  As the result of this dissolution transaction, we recognized a gain equal to the excess of the fair value of the

one

property distributed to us, plus the cash that we received, over the carrying value of our

20%

investment in the

eight

properties that were distributed from Duke/Hulfish (both to us and our partner). The computation of this gain is shown as follows (in thousands):

In connection with the dissolution of Duke/Hulfish, and the sale of its final property to a third party in July 2016, we recognized promote income (additional incentive-based cash distributions from the joint venture, in excess of our

20%

ownership interest), totaling

$26.3 million

, during the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

Other 2016 Acquisitions

In addition to the properties acquired from the Quantico Joint Venture, we acquired

three

properties during the year ended

December 31, 2016

, which included the industrial property received as part of a non-cash distribution in connection with the dissolution of Duke/Hulfish. The following table summarizes the fair value of amounts recognized for each major class of asset (in thousands) for these acquisitions during 2016:

Acquisitions

We acquired

two

industrial properties during the year ended

December 31, 2015

, one of which was treated as a business combination and one as an asset acquisition.  The following table summarizes the fair value of amounts recognized for each major class of asset (in thousands) for these acquisitions:

The leases in the acquired properties had a weighted average remaining life at acquisition of approximately

9.2 years

.

Fair Value Measurements

The fair value estimates used in allocating the aggregate fair value of an acquisition, to the extent accounted for as a business combination, among the individual components of real estate assets and liabilities were determined primarily through calculating the "as-if vacant" value of a building, using the income approach, and relied significantly upon internally determined assumptions. We have determined that these estimates primarily rely on Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions. The range of the most significant assumptions utilized in making the lease-up and future disposition estimates used in calculating the "as-if vacant" value for acquisition activities during


and


, respectively, are as follows:

Quantico Joint Venture Properties

Other 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions

Acquisition-Related Activity

The acquisition-related activity in our consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income consisted of transaction costs for completed acquisitions, which are expensed as incurred, as well as gains or losses related to

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

acquisitions where we had a pre-existing non-controlling ownership interest. We recognized

$7.2 million

of income from acquisition-related activities for the year ended

December 31, 2016

and

$8.5 million

and

$1.1 million

of expense for the years ended


and


, respectively.

Acquisition-related activity during 2016 was primarily driven by a gain of

$6.0 million

on the step-acquisition of the


Quantico Joint Venture properties and a gain of

$1.7 million

on the step-acquisition of an additional property from another unconsolidated joint venture, which was unrelated to the previously mentioned Quantico and Duke/Hulfish acquisitions.  Substantially all of the expense activity in 2015 was driven by an increase to the estimated fair value, and ultimate settlement, of contingent consideration that related to a previous period's real estate portfolio acquisition.

Dispositions

We disposed of buildings (see Note 6 for the number of buildings sold in each year, as well as for their classification between continuing and discontinued operations) and undeveloped land, which generated net cash proceeds of

$538.6 million

,

$1.68 billion

and

$493.2 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

On April 1, 2015, we completed the previously announced suburban office portfolio sale to a joint venture with affiliates of Starwood Capital Group, Vanderbilt Partners and Trinity Capital Advisors for approximately

$1.07 billion

in proceeds and recorded a gain on sale of

$406.1 million

.  The suburban office portfolio sale included all of our wholly-owned, in-service suburban office properties located in Nashville, Raleigh, South Florida and St. Louis. The portfolio included approximately

6.7 million

square feet across


buildings and


acres of undeveloped land.  Additionally, an office asset in Raleigh, which was under construction at the time of the suburban office portfolio sale, was completed in late 2015 and sold to the same buyers in January 2016.

A portion of the purchase price for the suburban office portfolio sale was financed through a

$200.0 million

first mortgage on certain of the properties in the Suburban Office Portfolio that we provided to the buyer.  The first mortgage matured on December 31, 2016, was prepayable after January 1, 2016, and bore interest at

LIBOR

plus

1.5%

. This first mortgage was repaid in full during 2016.

On April 8, 2015, we completed the sale of


non-strategic industrial properties for

$270.0 million

in proceeds and recorded a gain on sale of

$107.4 million

. These properties totaled

5.2 million

square feet and were located in primarily Midwest markets.

Included in the building dispositions in 2014 was the sale of

six

office properties in Cincinnati, Ohio, which totaled

1.0 million

square feet and were sold for

$150.5 million

, as well as the sale of

two

office properties in South Florida, which totaled

466,000

square feet and were sold for

$128.0 million

.

The income tax benefit from continuing operations in 2014 was triggered by sales of properties owned, or partially owned, by our taxable REIT subsidiary.  Income tax expense included in discontinued operations in 2014 was also the result of the sale of a property, prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08, which was partially owned by our taxable REIT subsidiary where we have no continuing involvement.

During the year ended December 31, 2014,

eleven

office properties,

eleven

industrial properties and

one

retail property were sold by

six

of our unconsolidated joint ventures, for which our capital distributions totaled

$91.8 million

and our share of gains, which are included in equity in earnings, totaled

$84.6 million

.  These sales included a

436,000

square foot office tower in Atlanta, Georgia and a

382,000

square foot retail property in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

All other dispositions were not individually material.

(1) Differences between the net investment in our unconsolidated joint ventures and our underlying equity in the net assets of the ventures are primarily a result of previous impairments related to our investment in the unconsolidated joint ventures, basis differences associated with the sales of properties to joint ventures in which we retained an ownership interest and loans we have made to the joint ventures. These adjustments have resulted in an aggregate difference reducing our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures by

$22.2 million

and

$33.7 million

as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.  The substantial majority of the basis differences are related to other than temporary impairments on joint venture investments recognized during 2015, as described hereafter.  Differences between historical cost basis and the basis reflected at the joint venture level (other than loans and impairments) are typically depreciated over the life of the related asset.

Other Than Temporary Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

During 2015, we recognized

$30.0 million

of charges through equity in earnings related to investments in

three

of our unconsolidated joint ventures that we determined had experienced declines in fair value that were other than temporary.

The most significant of these impairment charges pertain to our investment in the Linden joint venture, whose sole asset is undeveloped retail land. The Linden joint venture has not been able to proceed with development of its land as the result of a series of zoning and use-related legal challenges.  During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we changed our strategy such that we now intend to monetize our investment in the joint venture rather than holding for development and continuing to attempt to resolve the legal challenges.  As the result of this change in strategy, we determined that an other-than-temporary decline in the value of our investment in the joint venture had taken place.  During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a

$19.5 million

impairment charge to write our investment in the Linden joint venture to its fair value.  The fair value of our investment in the joint venture was primarily based on offers received for the site.  The joint venture had no outstanding debt as of December 31, 2015.

We believe that all of the fair value estimates used in recording the above-mentioned charges were based on level 3 inputs, as previously defined.

Discontinued Operations, Assets Held-for-Sale and Impairments

Discontinued Operations

The following table illustrates the number of sold or held-for-sale properties included in, or excluded from, discontinued operations:

For the properties that were classified in discontinued operations, we allocated interest expense to discontinued operations and have included such interest expense in computing income from discontinued operations. Interest expense allocable to discontinued operations includes interest on any secured debt for properties included in discontinued operations and an allocable share of our consolidated unsecured interest expense for unencumbered properties. The allocation of unsecured interest expense to discontinued operations was based upon the gross book value of the unencumbered real estate assets included in discontinued operations as it related to the total gross book value of our unencumbered real estate assets. There were no additional properties classified as discontinued operations during 2016 and, as such, no interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations during that year.

The following table illustrates impairment charges recognized during the years ended

and


, respectively (in thousands):

Primarily as the result of changes in our intended use for certain of our undeveloped land holdings, we recognized impairment charges of

$14.3 million

$19.5 million

and

$33.7 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  The various land holdings written down to fair value totaled


,


and


acres for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  The fair value of the land upon which we recognized impairment charges was estimated based on asset-specific offers to purchase, comparable transactions and, in certain cases, estimates made by national and local independent real estate brokers who were familiar with the land parcels subject to evaluation as well as with conditions in the specific markets where the various land parcels are located.  In all cases when estimates from brokers were utilized, members of our senior management who were responsible for the individual markets where the land parcels are located, and members of the Company’s accounting and financial management team, reviewed the broker’s estimates for factual accuracy and reasonableness.  In all cases, we were ultimately responsible for all valuation estimates made in determining the extent of the impairment. Our valuation estimates primarily relied upon Level 3 inputs.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed a review of our existing portfolio of buildings and determined that certain buildings, which had previously not been actively marketed for disposal, were not strategic and would not be held as long-term investments. We determined that, as the result of this change to management's strategy,

six

properties were impaired during the year ended December 31,


. Impairment charges of

$15.4 million

were recognized for the year ended December 31,


. Our estimates of fair value for these buildings were based primarily upon asset-specific purchase and sales contracts as well as using the income approach for a single property.  For the property for which the income approach was utilized in determining fair value, which was an office property in Washington D.C., the most significant assumptions utilized were the exit capitalization rate of

8.50%

and the net rental rate of

$12.50

per square foot.  We have concluded that our valuation estimates for the building impairments recognized during 2014 were primarily based on Level 3 inputs.

Indebtedness at

December 31, 2016

and


consists of the following (in thousands):

Secured Debt

At

December 31, 2016

, our secured debt was collateralized by rental properties with a carrying value of

$848.5 million

and by a letter of credit in the amount of

$2.9 million

.

The fair value of our fixed rate secured debt at

December 31, 2016

was

$415.2 million

. Because our fixed rate secured debt is not actively traded in any marketplace, we utilized a discounted cash flow methodology to determine its fair value. Accordingly, we calculated fair value by applying an estimate of the current market rate to discount the debt's remaining contractual cash flows. Our estimate of a current market rate, which is the most significant input in the discounted cash flow calculation, is intended to replicate debt of similar maturity and loan-to-value relationship. The estimated rates ranged from

2.80%

to

4.00%

, depending on the attributes of the specific loans. The current market rates we utilized were internally estimated; therefore, we have concluded that our determination of fair value for our fixed rate secured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.

During 2016, we repaid

seven

loans, totaling

$346.7 million

, which had a weighted average stated rate of

5.90%

.

During 2015, we repaid


secured loans, totaling

$231.2 million

.  These loans had a weighted average stated interest rate of

5.41%

.  Certain of these secured loans were repaid prior to their scheduled maturity date, which resulted in a

$3.7 million

loss on extinguishment, which included both prepayment penalties as well as the write-off of unamortized deferred loan and mark to market costs.

Unsecured Debt

At

December 31, 2016

, with the exception of the

$250.0 million

variable rate term note described below, all of our unsecured debt bore interest at fixed rates and primarily consisted of unsecured notes that are publicly traded.  We utilized broker estimates in estimating the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt. Our unsecured notes are thinly traded and, in certain cases, the broker estimates were not based upon comparable transactions. The broker estimates took into account any recent trades within the same series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, comparisons to recent trades of other series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, trades of fixed rate unsecured debt from companies with profiles similar to ours, as well as overall economic conditions. We reviewed these broker estimates for reasonableness and accuracy, considering whether the estimates were based upon market participant assumptions within the principal and most advantageous market and whether any other observable inputs would be more accurate indicators of fair value than the broker estimates. We concluded that the broker estimates were representative of fair value. We have determined that our estimation of the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs, as defined. The estimated trading values of our fixed rate unsecured debt, depending on the maturity and coupon rates, ranged from

96.00%

to

127.00%

of face value.

We utilize a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value of our

$250.0 million

variable rate term loan. Our estimate of the current market rate for our variable rate term loan was

1.63%

and was based

-


-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

primarily upon level 3 inputs.  To the extent that credit spreads have changed since the origination of this term loan, the net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate would represent the difference between the book value and the fair value. Our estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate, considering current market conditions and our specific credit profile, at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings. As our credit spreads have not changed appreciably, we believe that the contractual interest rate and the current market rate on the term loan are the same.

We took the following actions during


and


as it pertains to our unsecured indebtedness:

•

In 2016, we issued

$375.0 million

of unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of

3.25%

•

During June and July 2016 we repaid

$275.0 million

of our

5.95%

senior unsecured notes, which had a scheduled maturity of February 2017, through the combination of a tender offer and the subsequent redemption of the remaining notes that were not tendered, for cash payments totaling

$283.5 million

.  Together, the tender offer and the redemption resulted in an

$8.8 million

loss on debt extinguishment, which primarily consisted of premiums paid to the noteholders and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

•

In October 2016, we redeemed

$129.5 million

of unsecured notes, which had a scheduled maturity in August 2019, for a cash payment of

$154.1 million

.  These notes had a stated rate of

8.25%

and an effective rate of

8.38%

.  We recognized a net loss on the extinguishment of these notes in the fourth quarter totaling

$25.2 million

, which was comprised of a make-whole payment to the noteholders as well as the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

•

In February 2015, we repaid a

$250.0 million

senior unsecured note at its maturity date.  This loan had a stated interest rate of

7.38%

and an effective rate of

7.50%

.

•

In April 2015, the Partnership completed a tender offer to purchase, for a combined aggregate purchase price (exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest) of up to

$500.0 million

, certain of its outstanding series of unsecured notes. A portion of the proceeds from the suburban office portfolio sale were used to fund the Tender Offer, which resulted in the repurchase of notes having a face value of

$424.9 million

, for a cash payment of

$500.0 million

.  The repurchased notes had contractual maturity dates ranging between February 2017 and March 2020 and bore interest at stated rates ranging between

5.95%

and

8.25%

.

•

In May 2015, we repurchased unsecured notes with a face value of

$6.3 million

, for a cash payment of

$7.1 million

.  These notes had a stated interest rate of

6.50%

and an effective rate of

6.08%

.

•

In October 2015, we redeemed

$150.0 million

in unsecured notes that had a scheduled maturity in March 2016, for a cash payment of

$152.6 million

.  These notes had a stated interest rate of

5.50%

and an effective rate of

6.72%

.

•

During 2015, the early repayment of unsecured notes, either through the tender offer or repurchase, resulted in an aggregate loss on extinguishment of

$82.0 million

, which included applicable repurchase premiums as well as the write-off of unamortized deferred loan costs.

The indentures (and related supplemental indentures) governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations.

We were in compliance with all such covenants at December 31, 2016

.

Unsecured Line of Credit

Our unsecured line of credit at

December 31, 2016

is described as follows (in thousands):

The Partnership's unsecured line of credit has an interest rate on borrowings of

LIBOR

plus

0.93%

(equal to

1.70%

for outstanding borrowings at

December 31, 2016

), which is a decrease from a rate of

LIBOR

plus

1.05%

as of December 31, 2015 due to an upgrade in our credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service from Baa2 to Baa1and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Standard and Poor's Financial Services from BBB to BBB+.  The Partnership's unsecured line of credit has a maturity date of

January 2019

, but may be extended by one year at our option.  Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional

$400.0 million

, for a total of up to

$1.60 billion

.  This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At

December 31, 2016

,

we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

To the extent that there are outstanding borrowings, we utilize a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value of our unsecured line of credit.

T

o the extent that credit spreads have changed since the origination of the line of credit, the net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate would represent the difference between the book value and the fair value. Our estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate, considering current market conditions and our specific credit profile, at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings. As our credit spreads have not changed appreciably, we believe that the contractual interest rate and the current market rate on the line of credit are the same. To the extent there are outstanding borrowings, this current market rate is internally estimated and therefore would be primarily based upon a level 3 input.

Changes in Fair Value

As all of our fair value debt disclosures relied primarily on Level 3 inputs, the following table summarizes the book value and changes in the fair value of our debt for the year ended

December 31, 2016

Segment Reporting

We had

three

reportable operating segments at

December 31, 2016

, the first two of which consist of the ownership and rental of (i) industrial and (ii) medical office real estate investments. Properties not included in our reportable segments, which do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment, are generally referred to as non-reportable Rental Operations.  Our non-reportable Rental Operations primarily include our office properties.  The operations of our industrial and medical office properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations, are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations."

Our third reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development, general contracting and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively referred to as "Service Operations." Our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise.

Revenues by Reportable Segment

The following table shows the revenues for each of the reportable segments, as well as a reconciliation to consolidated revenues, for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


(in thousands):

Supplemental Performance Measure

PNOI is the non-GAAP supplemental performance measure that we use to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources among, the real estate investments in the reportable and operating segments that comprise our Rental Operations.  PNOI for our Rental Operations segments is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items (collectively referred to as "Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI," as shown in the following table).  Additionally, we do not allocate interest expense, depreciation expense and certain other non-property specific revenues and expenses (collectively referred to as "Non-Segment Items," as shown in the following table) to our individual operating segments.

We evaluate the performance of our Service Operations reportable segment using net income or loss, as allocated to that segment ("Earnings from Service Operations").

The following table shows a reconciliation of our segment-level measures of profitability to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes, for the years ended

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes. PNOI excludes expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, PNOI may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Assets by Reportable Segment

The assets for each of the reportable segments at

December 31, 2016

and


were as follows (in thousands):

Tenant improvements and leasing costs to re-let rental space that we previously leased to tenants are referred to as second generation expenditures. Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties are also second generation expenditures. In addition to revenues and PNOI, we also review our second generation capital expenditures in measuring the performance of our individual Rental Operations segments. We review these expenditures to determine the costs associated with re-

During 2014, pursuant to the share repurchase plan approved by our board of directors, the General Partner repurchased

750,243

preferred shares from among our remaining outstanding series. The preferred shares repurchased had a total redemption value of approximately

$18.8 million

and were repurchased for

$17.7 million

$618,000

of initial issuance costs, the ratable portion of such costs associated with the repurchased shares, were charged against income attributable to common shareholders. As the result of these repurchases, an adjustment of approximately

$483,000

was included as an increase to net income attributable to common shareholders.

In August 2014, the General Partner redeemed all

384,530

shares of its outstanding

6.625%

Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares ("Series J Shares"). The cash redemption price for the Series J Shares was

In April 2014, the General Partner's shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of the General Partner's common stock from

400 million

to

600 million

.

Partnership

For each common share or preferred share that the General Partner issues, the Partnership issues a corresponding Common Unit or Preferred Unit, as applicable, to the General Partner in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. Similarly, when the General Partner redeems or repurchases common shares or preferred shares, the Partnership redeems the corresponding Common Units or Preferred Units held by the General Partner at the same price.

shares of the General Partner's common stock under our stock-based employee and non-employee compensation plans.

Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")

Under our


Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by the General Partner's shareholders in

April 2015

, and our


Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Compensation Plans"), RSUs may be granted to non-employee directors, executive officers and selected management employees. A RSU is economically equivalent to a share of the General Partner's common stock.

To the extent that a recipient of a RSU grant is not determined to be retirement eligible, as defined by the Compensation Plans, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  Expense is recognized immediately at the date of grant to the extent a recipient is retirement eligible and expense is accelerated to the extent that a participant will become retirement eligible prior to the end of the contractual life of granted RSUs.

The following table summarizes transactions for our RSUs, excluding dividend equivalents, for

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

The effectiveness of our hedges is evaluated throughout their lives using the hypothetical derivative method under which the change in fair value of the actual swap designated as the hedging instrument is compared to the change in fair value of a hypothetical swap. We had no material interest rate derivatives, when considering the fair value of the hedging instruments, in any period presented.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Partnership has guaranteed the repayment of

$32.9 million

of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

$311.1 million

at December 31, 2016. No payments on these ground leases, which are classified as operating leases, are material in any individual year.

In addition to ground leases, we are party to other operating leases as part of conducting our business, including leases of office space from third parties, with a total future payment obligation of

$43.4 million

at December 31, 2016.  No future payments on these leases are material in any individual year.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

We own certain parcels of land that are subject to special property tax assessments levied by quasi municipal entities. To the extent that such special assessments are fixed and determinable, the discounted value of the full assessment is recorded as a liability.  We have
