PART I

Item 1.  Business

Background

We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of our initial public offering in February 1986. In October 1993, we completed an additional common stock offering and acquired the rental real estate
and service businesses of Duke Associates, whose operations began in 1972. As of December 31, 2008, our diversified portfolio of 738 rental properties (including nine properties comprising 1.4 million square feet under development and
excluding all properties developed with the intent to sell) encompasses approximately 128.6 million rentable square feet and is leased by a diverse base of approximately 3,400 tenants whose businesses include manufacturing, retailing, wholesale
trade, distribution, healthcare and professional services. We also own or control more than 7,200 acres of land available for development.

Our Service
Operations provide, on a fee basis, leasing, property and asset management, development, construction, build-to-suit and other tenant-related services. We conduct our Service Operations through Duke Realty Services LLC, Duke Realty Services Limited
Partnership and Duke Construction Limited Partnership. Our Rental Operations are conducted through Duke Realty Limited Partnership. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for financial information related to our reportable segments.

Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition, we have 17 regional offices located in Alexandria, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus,
Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Raleigh, North Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Weston, Florida. We had more than 1,200
employees as of December 31, 2008.

Operational Objectives

Our primary operational objective is to maximize Funds From Operations (“FFO”) by (i) maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing
properties; (ii) selectively developing and acquiring new properties for our Rental Operations in our existing markets when economic conditions improve; (iii) using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction
manager in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis; and (iv) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating
performance measure of an equity REIT like Duke. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT created FFO as
a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from

- 2 -


net income determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The
most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably
over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost
accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus certain
non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more
meaningful. Management believes FFO is a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance) because, by
excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO provides a useful comparison of the operating performance of our real estate between periods
or as compared to different companies.

As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and
construction services which, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage both as a real estate operator and in future development activities.

We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or local levels. As a result, we intend to
continue our emphasis on increasing our market share and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as
to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on strong customer relationships to provide third-party construction services across the United States. As a fully integrated real estate
company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our industrial, office and healthcare customers not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and
expansion flexibility.

All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real
estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply and demand of similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive
on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator. In addition, our Service Operations face
competition from a considerable number of other real estate companies that provide comparable services, some of whom may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us.

Financial Strategy

Our financing strategy is to actively manage the
components of our capital structure and maintain investment grade ratings for our unsecured notes from our credit rating agencies. Additionally, to the extent that market conditions permit, we employ a capital recycling program that utilizes sales
of operating real estate assets that no longer fit our strategies to generate proceeds that can be recycled into new properties that better fit our current and long-term strategies.

- 3 -


We also seek to maintain a balanced and flexible capital structure by: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity
dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than 20%; (iii) pursuing current and future long-term debt financings; (iv) maintaining fixed
charge coverage and other ratios at levels required to maintain investment grade ratings for our unsecured notes; (v) generating proceeds from the sale of non-strategic properties and (vi) issuing perpetual preferred shares for 5-10% of
our total capital structure. However, given the current state of the economy and capital markets, our near term focus is on improving liquidity through capital preservation by substantially decreasing acquisitions and development, diligently
managing our overhead expenses, reducing dividend payments and actively seeking new sources of capital, including secured indebtedness, to refinance and extend our existing debt maturities. In order to strengthen our capital structure, we intend to
repurchase on the open market our unsecured debt maturing over the next three years, from time to time when favorable pricing is available. By focusing on strengthening our balance sheet, we expect to be positioned for future growth as the economy
improves.

In addition, as discussed under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” we have a $1.3 billion unsecured line of credit available for our capital needs. We may, at our sole discretion, exercise an option to extend the maturity of this line of credit from January 2010 to January 2011.

Corporate Governance

Since our inception, we not only have strived
to be a top-performer operationally, but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. Our system of governance reinforces this commitment. Summarized below are the highlights of our Corporate Governance
initiatives.

In addition to the other information contained in
this Report, you should carefully consider, in consultation with your legal, financial and other professional advisors, the risks described below, as well as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under
the caption “Risk Factors” in evaluating us and our business before making a decision regarding an investment in our securities.

The risks
contained in this Report are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem to be immaterial, also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,
business and prospects. The trading price of our securities could decline due to the materialization of any of these risks, and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment.

- 5 -


This Report also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of certain factors, including,
but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section in this Report entitled “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information regarding
forward-looking statements.

Risks Related to Our Business

Our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

We are subject to the
risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness, or that the terms
of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. Specifically, we may not be able to refinance our $1.3 billion unsecured line of credit at its maturity with the same capacity, on terms that are as favorable as the
current terms, or at all. Additionally, we may not be able to refinance borrowings at our unconsolidated subsidiaries on favorable terms or at all. If our debt cannot be paid, refinanced or extended, we may not be able to make distributions to
shareholders at expected levels or at all. Further, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher interest rates or other restrictive financial covenants upon the refinancing, then such refinancing would
adversely affect our cash flow and funds available for operation, development and distribution.

We are also subject to financial covenants under our
existing debt instruments. Should we fail to comply with the covenants in our existing debt instruments, then we would not only be in breach under the applicable debt instruments but we would also likely be unable to borrow any further amounts under
our other debt instruments, which could adversely affect our ability to fund operations. We also have incurred, and may incur in the future, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Thus, if market interest rates increase, so will our
debt expense, which could reduce our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to shareholders.

Debt financing may not be available and equity
issuances could be dilutive to our shareholders.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt
financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. Debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, on favorable terms or at all. If we
issue additional equity securities, instead of debt, to manage capital needs, the interests of our existing shareholders could be diluted.

Financial
and other covenants under existing credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.

The terms of our
various credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may
limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. If we are unable to refinance our
indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow would be adversely affected.

The current credit
crisis may limit our ability to refinance our debt obligations in the short-term and may limit our access to liquidity.

Approximately 46% of our
outstanding debt will mature between now and December 31, 2011. The majority of these debt maturities are comprised of $711.5 million of unsecured notes, $575.0 million of exchangeable unsecured notes, $125.0 million of corporate unsecured debt
and our $1.3 billion unsecured line of credit, which has an outstanding principal balance of $474.0 million as of December 31, 2008. The unsecured line

- 6 -


of credit matures in January 2010 with a one-year extension available at our option. Given the current economic conditions including, but not limited to, the
credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial markets, we may be unable to refinance these obligations on favorable terms, or at all, and could also potentially lose access to our current available liquidity under our unsecured line of
credit if one or more participating lenders default on their commitments. If we are unable to refinance these obligations prior to the maturity date, then we may be forced to seek liquidity through a variety of options, including, but not limited
to, the sale of properties at below market prices. In the event that we default on one or more of these obligations, it may result in additional defaults under our other obligations.

If we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity, then we may be unable to pursue future development projects and other strategic initiatives.

To complete our ongoing and planned development projects, and to pursue our other strategic initiatives, we must continue to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to
fund those activities. To generate that capital and liquidity, we rely upon funds from our existing operations, as well as funds that we raise through our capital raising activities. In the current economic environment, REITs like ours have faced
earnings pressures that have made it more difficult to generate capital and liquidity from existing operations. In addition, due to the recent crises in the credit and capital markets, it has become increasingly difficult to raise capital and
generate liquidity through the sale of equity and/or debt securities on favorable terms, if at all. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our short- and long-term needs, or if we are unable to generate
capital and liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, then we may be required to curtail our proposed development projects, as well as our other strategic initiatives.

Our stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to our shareholders.

Recently the equity securities markets have experienced a high degree of volatility, creating highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our common and preferred stock could further change in ways
that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors
that could negatively affect our share price, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock, include recent uncertainty in the markets, general market and economic conditions, as well as those factors described in
these “Risk Factors” and in other reports that we file with the SEC.

Many of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their
potential effects on the price of our common and preferred stock. If the market prices of our common and preferred stock decline further, then our shareholders may be unable to resell their shares upon terms that are attractive to them. We cannot
assure that the market price of our common and preferred stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the securities markets in general may continue to experience considerable unexpected price and volume
fluctuations.

We may issue debt and equity securities which are senior to our common stock and preferred stock as to distributions and in liquidation,
which could negatively affect the value of our common and preferred stock.

In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering
into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by certain of our assets, or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated
notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock.
Our preferred stock has a preference over our common stock with respect to distributions and upon liquidation, which could further limit our ability to make distributions to our common shareholders. Any additional preferred stock that we may issue
may have a preference over our common stock and existing series of preferred stock with respect to distributions and upon liquidation.

- 7 -


Our leverage strategy may require us to seek substantial amounts of commercial credit and issue debt securities to manage
our capital needs. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future
offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. Thus, our shareholders will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of their
shares of common stock and diluting their interest in us. We may change this leverage strategy from time to time without shareholder approval.

Our use
of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.

We currently have joint ventures that are not consolidated with our
financial statements. We may develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:

•

We could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property;

•

Our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties;

•

Our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues; and

•

Maturities of debt encumbering our jointly owned investments may not be able to be refinanced at all or on terms that are as favorable as the current terms.

The SEC has proposed changes to the eligibility requirements for Form S-3 that could prevent us from issuing debt securities on our
automatic shelf registration statement.

From time to time, DRLP issues debt securities pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form
S-3. On July 1, 2008, the SEC issued a proposed rule that would revise the transaction eligibility criteria for registering primary offerings of non-convertible securities (like DRLP’s debt securities) on Forms S-3. As proposed, the
instructions to these forms would no longer refer to security ratings by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization as a transaction requirement to permit issuers to register primary offerings of non-convertible securities for cash.
Instead, the Form S-3 would be available to register primary offerings of non-convertible securities if the issuer has issued (as of a date within 60 days prior to the filing of the registration statement) for cash more than $1 billion in
non-convertible securities, other than common equity, through registered primary offerings over the prior three years.

Currently, DRLP relies on the
eligibility standard for offerings of investment grade rated non-convertible debt securities in order to offer securities pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3. The SEC’s proposal would effectively eliminate this
eligibility standard. Although we currently satisfy the SEC’s proposed eligibility criteria (namely, having issued more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in registered offerings over the most recent three years), it is possible that we
may not meet this test in the future, in which case DRLP would not be eligible to issue securities on Form S-3. If DRLP is unable to issue securities of Form S-3, then, to the extent it seeks to issue registered securities, it would be required to
use Form S-1, which would impede our ability to launch and price public offerings of debt securities on short notice with the speed and efficiency necessary to take advantage of favorable market conditions.

Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders could decrease as a result of factors related to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate that are outside of our control.

Our business is subject to the risks incident to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate, many of which involve circumstances not within our
control. Such risks include the following:

•

Changes in the general economic climate;

•

The availability of capital on favorable terms, or at all;

•

Increases in interest rates;

•

Local conditions such as oversupply of property or a reduction in demand;

•

Competition for tenants;

•

Changes in market rental rates;

•

Oversupply or reduced demand for space in the areas where our properties are located;

•

Delay or inability to collect rent from tenants who are bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise unwilling or unable to pay;

•

Difficulty in leasing or re-leasing space quickly or on favorable terms;

•

Costs associated with periodically renovating, repairing and reletting rental space;

•

Our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance on our properties;

•

Our ability to control variable operating costs;

•

Changes in government regulations; and

•

Potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, tax and other laws.

Further, a significant portion of our costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs and our debt service payments, are generally not reduced when
circumstances cause a decrease in cash flow from our properties. Any one or more of these factors could result in a reduction in our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders.

Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from properties decreases.

Our financial results depend on leasing space in our real estate to tenants on terms favorable to us. Our income and funds available for distribution to our shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot meet their
lease obligations to us or we are unable to lease properties on favorable terms. In addition, if a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and we may incur substantial legal costs. Costs
associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment.

Our real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to development.

Although we have significantly reduced our development activities, we may still pursue select opportunities and have previously started developments that are currently
in various stages of completion. These development activities generally require various government and other approvals, which we may not receive. In addition, we also are subject to the following risks associated with development activities:

•

Unsuccessful development opportunities could result in direct expenses to us;

•

Construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated, or possibly unprofitable;

•

Time required to complete the construction of a project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting
our cash flow and liquidity;

•

Occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable;

•

Our ability to dispose of properties developed with the intent to sell or other properties we identify for sale in our capital recycling program could be impacted
by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain financing given the current state of the credit markets; and

•

Favorable sources to fund our development activities may not be available.

We may be unsuccessful in operating completed real estate projects.

We face the risk that the real estate projects
we develop or acquire will not perform in accordance with our expectations. This risk exists because of factors such as the following:

•

Prices paid for acquired facilities are based upon a series of market judgments; and

•

Costs of any improvements required to bring an acquired facility up to standards to establish the market position intended for that facility might exceed budgeted
costs.

Further, we can give no assurance that acquisition targets meeting our guidelines for quality and yield will be available, should
we seek them.

We are exposed to the risks of defaults by tenants.

Any of our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken their financial condition. Additionally, the recent disruption in the credit markets and the U.S. economy generally may lead to
additional financial difficulties and workforce reductions among our tenants. In the event of default or the insolvency of a significant number of our tenants, we may experience a substantial loss of rental revenue and/or delays in collecting rent
and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection, a court could allow the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely
affected if a significant number of our tenants became unable to meet their obligations to us, became insolvent or declared bankruptcy.

We may be
unable to renew leases or relet space.

When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space.
Even if our tenants do renew or we are able to relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of renovations, if necessary) may be less favorable than current lease terms. These risks may be further intensified as the result
of the disruption in the U.S. economy. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space, or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than current rates, then our income and distributable cash flow
would be adversely affected, especially if we were unable to lease a significant amount of the space vacated by tenants in our properties.

Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our facilities, including property, liability, fire, flood and extended coverage. We believe this coverage is of the type
and amount customarily obtained for real property. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economically
insurable. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in
the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also
may make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive may not be adequate to restore our economic position in a property. If an
insured loss occurred, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property, and we would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Although we believe
our insurance is with highly rated providers, we are also subject to the risk that such providers may be unwilling or unable to pay our claims when made.

Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.

From time to time, we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without
any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it,
which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:

•

liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

•

claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;

•

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

We could be exposed to significant environmental liabilities as a result of conditions of which we currently are not aware.

As an owner and operator of real property, we may be liable under various federal, state and local laws for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous
substances released on or in our property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. In addition, we could have greater difficulty in
selling real estate on which hazardous substances were present or in obtaining borrowings using such real estate as collateral. It is our general policy to have Phase I environmental audits performed for all of our properties and land by qualified
environmental consultants. These Phase I environmental audits have not revealed any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on our business. However, a Phase I environmental audit does not involve invasive procedures such
as soil sampling or ground water analysis, and we cannot be sure that the Phase I environmental audits did not fail to reveal a significant environmental liability or that a prior owner did not create a material environmental condition on our
properties or land which has not yet been discovered. We could also incur environmental liability as a result of future uses or conditions of such real estate or changes in applicable environmental laws.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

If we were to cease to qualify as a REIT, we and our shareholders would lose significant tax benefits.

We intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Qualification as a REIT provides
significant tax advantages to us and our shareholders. However, in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited
judicial and administrative interpretations. Satisfaction of these requirements also depends on various factual circumstances not entirely within our control. The fact that we hold our assets through an operating partnership and its subsidiaries
further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Although we believe that we can continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot offer any assurance
that we will continue to do so or that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the qualification requirements or the federal income tax consequences of qualification. If we were
to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would have the following effects:

•

We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders and would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax)
on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

•

Unless we were entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT;

•

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders would decrease due to the additional tax liability for the year or years involved; and

•

We would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders in order to qualify as a REIT.

As such, failure to qualify as a REIT would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities.

REIT distribution requirements limit the amount of cash we have available for other business purposes, including amounts that we need to fund our future capital
needs.

To maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must annually distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable
income, excluding net capital gains. We intend to continue to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the 90% distribution requirement. However, this requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital for use for other business
purposes. If we do not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements, we may have to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements. If we fail to make a required
distribution, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax developments could affect the desirability of investing in us for individual
taxpayers.

In May 2003, federal legislation was enacted that reduced the maximum tax rate for dividends payable to individual taxpayers generally from
38.6% to 15% (from January 1, 2003 through 2008). However, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for this treatment, except in limited circumstances. Although this legislation did not have a direct adverse effect on the taxation of REITs
or dividends paid by REITs, the more favorable treatment for non-REIT dividends could cause individual investors to consider investments in non-REIT corporations as more attractive relative to an investment in us as a REIT.

- 12 -


U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and investments in REITs may change, which may result in the loss of our
tax benefits of operating as a REIT.

The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of a REIT and an investment in a REIT may be modified by
legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time. Revisions in U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect us and the tax consequences of an investment in our common shares.

We are subject to certain provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, which may reduce the likelihood of our shareholders receiving a control
premium for their shares.

Indiana anti-takeover legislation and certain provisions in our governing documents, as we discuss below, may discourage
potential acquirers from pursuing a change-of-control transaction with us. As a result, our shareholders may be less likely to receive a control premium for their shares.

Unissued Preferred Stock.

Our charter permits our board of directors to classify unissued preferred stock by setting the rights and preferences of the shares at the time of issuance. This power enables our
board to adopt a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill. Although we have repealed our previously existing poison pill and our current board of directors has adopted a policy not to issue preferred stock as an anti-takeover measure,
our board can change this policy at any time. The adoption of a poison pill would discourage a potential bidder from acquiring a significant position in the company without the approval of our board.

Business-Combination Provisions of Indiana Law.

We have not opted out of the business-combination provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law. As a
result, potential bidders may have to negotiate with our board of directors before acquiring 10% of our stock. Without securing board approval of the proposed business combination before crossing the 10% ownership threshold, a bidder would not be
permitted to complete a business combination for five years after becoming a 10% shareholder. Even after the five-year period, a business combination with the significant shareholder would require a “fair price” as defined in the Indiana
Business Corporation Law or the approval of a majority of the disinterested shareholders.

Control-Share-Acquisition Provisions of Indiana
Law.

We have not opted out of the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law regarding acquisitions of control shares. Therefore, those who acquire a significant block (at least 20%) of our shares may only vote a portion of their
shares unless our other shareholders vote to accord full voting rights to the acquiring person. Moreover, if the other shareholders vote to give full voting rights with respect to the control shares and the acquiring person has acquired a majority
of our outstanding shares, the other shareholders would be entitled to special dissenters’ rights.

Supermajority Voting Provisions.

Our
charter prohibits business combinations or significant disposition transactions with a holder of 10% of our shares unless:

•

The holders of 80% of our outstanding shares of capital stock approve the transaction;

•

The transaction has been approved by three-fourths of those directors who served on the board before the shareholder became a 10% owner; or

•

The significant shareholder complies with the “fair price” provisions of our charter.

Among the transactions with large shareholders requiring the supermajority shareholder approval are dispositions of assets with a value greater than or equal to
$1,000,000 and business combinations.

- 13 -


Operating Partnership Provisions.

The limited partnership agreement of DRLP contains provisions that could
discourage change-of-control transactions, including a requirement that holders of at least 90% of the outstanding partnership units held by us and other unit holders approve:

•

Any voluntary sale, exchange, merger, consolidation or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of DRLP in one or more transactions other than a
disposition occurring upon a financing or refinancing of DRLP;

•

Our merger, consolidation or other business combination with another entity unless after the transaction substantially all of the assets of the surviving entity are
contributed to DRLP in exchange for units;

•

Our transfer of our interests in DRLP other than to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries; and

•

Any reclassification or recapitalization or change of outstanding shares of our common stock other than certain changes in par value, stock splits, stock dividends
or combinations.

We are dependent on key personnel.

Our executive officers and other senior officers have a significant role in the success of our Company. Our ability to retain our management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the
management group leave our Company is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely impact our financial condition
and cash flow. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

From time to time, we repurchase our securities under a repurchase program that initially was approved by the board of directors and publicly announced in October 2001 (the “Repurchase Program”). In October
2008, the board of directors adopted a resolution (the “October 2008 resolution”) that reaffirmed management’s authority to repurchase common shares under the Repurchase Program and also amended the Repurchase Program to permit the
repurchase of outstanding series of preferred shares, as well as any outstanding series of debt securities. The October 2008 resolution also limited management’s authority to repurchase a maximum of $75.0 million of common shares, $75.0 million
of debt securities and $25.0 million of preferred shares. The authority to repurchase such securities expires in October 2009. In December 2008, the board of directors granted management further authority, in addition to the previous $75.0 million
authorization, to repurchase any outstanding debt securities maturing through December 31, 2011. Under the Repurchase Program, we also execute share repurchases on an ongoing basis associated with certain employee elections under our
compensation and benefit programs.

There was no common share repurchase activity for any of the three months in the quarter ended December 31, 2008.

(1) Funds From Operations (“FFO”) is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating
performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) like Duke. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
(“NAREIT”). NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not
be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly
assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered the presentation of
operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses
from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the
investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes FFO is a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in conjunction with net
income which remains the primary measure of performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO provides a useful
comparison of the operating performance of our real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.

See reconciliation of FFO to GAAP net
income under the caption “Year in Review” under item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations through a related
entity in 1972. As of December 31, 2008, we:

•

Owned or jointly controlled 738 industrial, office, healthcare and retail properties (including properties under development and excluding all properties developed
with the intent to sell), consisting of approximately 128.6 million square feet; and

•

Owned or jointly controlled more than 7,200 acres of land with an estimated future development potential of more than 107 million square feet of industrial,
office, healthcare and retail properties.

We provide the following services for our properties and for certain properties owned by third
parties and joint ventures:

•

Property leasing;

•

Property management;

•

Asset management;

•

Construction;

•

Development; and

•

Other tenant-related services.

- 19 -


We also develop or acquire properties with the intent to sell (hereafter referred to as “Build-for-Sale”
properties). Build-for-Sale properties represent properties where our investment strategy results in a decision to sell the property within a relatively short time after it is placed in service. Build-for-Sale properties are generally identified as
such prior to construction commencement and may either be sold or contributed to an unconsolidated entity in which we have an ownership interest or sold outright to third parties.

Financial Strategy

Our financing strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure and
maintain investment grade ratings for our unsecured notes from our credit rating agencies. Additionally, to the extent that market conditions permit, we employ a capital recycling program that utilizes sales of operating real estate assets that no
longer fit our strategies to generate proceeds that can be recycled into new properties that better fit our current and long-term strategies.

We also seek
to maintain a balanced and flexible capital structure by: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt
less than 20%; (iii) pursuing current and future long-term debt financings; (iv) maintaining fixed charge coverage and other ratios at levels required to maintain investment grade ratings for our unsecured notes; (v) generating
proceeds from the sale of non-strategic properties and (vi) issuing perpetual preferred shares for 5-10% of our total capital structure. However, given the current state of the economy and capital markets, our near term focus is on improving
liquidity through capital preservation by substantially decreasing acquisitions and development, diligently managing our overhead expenses, reducing dividend payments and actively seeking new sources of capital, including secured indebtedness, to
refinance and extend our debt maturities. In order to strengthen our capital structure we intend to repurchase unsecured debt, on the open market, when favorable pricing is available. By focusing on strengthening our balance sheet, we expect to be
well-positioned for future growth as the economy improves.

Operational Objectives

Our primary operational objective is to maximize Funds From Operations (“FFO”) by (i) maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates
through the management of our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets when economic conditions improve; (iii) using our construction expertise
to act as a general contractor or construction manager in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis; and (iv) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.

Year in Review

Notwithstanding the overall state of the
economy, we were still able to execute several significant transactions throughout the year as discussed below. However, due to the volatile state of the credit markets, we were forced to limit our development activities. While the curtailment of
development activities, in the short-term, will allow us to preserve additional capital, it will also result in a short-term decrease in the rate of revenue growth, and proceeds from dispositions of Build-for-Sale properties, from what has been
achieved historically.

Net income available for common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $56.6 million, or $.38 per share
(diluted), compared to net income of $217.7 million, or $1.55 per share (diluted) for the year ended 2007. The decrease in net income available for common shareholders was driven largely by significant held-for-rental property sales that took place
during 2007 as part of our capital recycling program. Access to credit by potential buyers was limited during 2008; therefore, we were not able to continue our capital recycling

- 20 -


program in 2008 at the levels we achieved in 2007. FFO available to common shareholders totaled $375.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
compared to $384.0 million for the same period in 2007. Industry analysts and investors use FFO as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”). FFO is calculated in accordance with the
definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income (loss) determined in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation
and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in
accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have
considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical
cost depreciation, among other items, from GAAP net income. Management believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes
comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes FFO is a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating results and financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains
the primary measure of performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO provides a useful comparison of the operating
performance of our real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.

The following table summarizes the calculation of FFO for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively (in thousands):

During 2008, we continued to execute within our core areas of competency, while making adjustments due to the
general disruption in the U.S. economy. Highlights of our operating activities are as follows:

•

In December 2008, we sold 16 acres of land in Alexandria, VA, to the United States government for the development of an administrative office complex for the U.S.
Department of the Army. The land sale, for $105.1 million, is part of an overall $953.1 million development and construction agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that implements the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (the
“BRAC Construction Contract”) and will continue through 2011. The development will consist of facilities containing more than 1.7 million square feet, and includes two multi-story office towers, two parking garages and a public
transportation center. The total anticipated profit on the overall agreement will be recognized over the course of the contract using the percentage of completion method of accounting.

- 21 -


•

During 2008, we sold seven newly developed properties to unconsolidated joint ventures from which we received $251.6 million of sales and financing proceeds and
recognized pre-tax gains on sale of $23.3 million. We also sold seven Build-for-Sale properties to third parties for $120.5 million of gross proceeds and recognized pre-tax gains on sale of $18.8 million.

•

We disposed of eight wholly owned held-for-rental properties for $79.4 million of gross proceeds and also generated $47.4 million of gross proceeds, excluding the
government contract described above, from the divestiture of non-strategic land parcels.

•

The current state of the economy has limited our ability to access debt and equity capital markets. Management’s priorities with regard to uses of capital for
development of new properties, therefore, have been re-evaluated and new wholly owned development commitments have been significantly curtailed. As such, the total cost of our wholly owned properties under construction totaled $372.6 million at
December 31, 2008 with $142.5 million of such costs having been incurred through that date. Our total cost for joint venture properties under construction was $356.6 million at December 31, 2008 with $189.6 million of costs incurred
through that date.

•

The occupancy level for our in-service held-for-rental portfolio (including joint venture properties) decreased from 92.1% at December 31, 2007 to 89.5% at
December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of developments which were not fully leased being placed in service during 2008. However, occupancy of this portfolio did improve over the last two quarters of the year as we experienced
positive net leasing absorption for the year.

We engaged in a number of financing activities during 2008 to adapt to, as
well as to capitalize on, opportunities provided by the volatility in the credit markets. Highlights of our key financing activities in 2008 are as follows:

•

In January 2008, we repaid $125.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 3.36% on their scheduled maturity date.

•

In February 2008, we issued $300.0 million of 8.375% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares.

•

In May 2008, we repaid $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 6.76% on their scheduled maturity date.

•

In May 2008, we issued $325.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due in May 2013. After including the effect of forward starting swaps, which were designated
as cash flow hedges for this offering, the effective interest rate is 7.36%.

•

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we opportunistically repurchased preferred shares on the open market in order to take advantage of significant trading discounts.
In total, we repurchased preferred shares having a redemption value of approximately $27.4 million for $12.4 million, which resulted in an approximate $14.0 million gain on repurchase after considering the charge-off of offering costs from those
shares.

•

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we also repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes maturing in 2009 and 2010 on the open market. We
repurchased unsecured notes that had a face value of approximately $38.5 million, for approximately $36.5 million, and recognized a gain on extinguishment of these notes of approximately $2.0 million.

- 22 -


•

In order to strengthen our liquidity position going forward and to preserve cash for future debt maturities, the board of directors resolved in January 2009 to
reduce our annual dividend from $1.94 per share to $1.00 per share. When considering common shares and limited partnership units outstanding as of December 31, 2008, this dividend reduction will generate $145.2 million in additional available
cash annually, when compared to an annual dividend of $1.94 per share.

Key Performance Indicators

Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our industrial, office, healthcare and retail properties (“Rental Operations”). The following
discussion highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider critical drivers of future revenues. All square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect both wholly owned and joint venture properties.

Occupancy Analysis:

As discussed above, our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue
from continuing operations. The following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in-service portfolio of rental properties (including rental properties of unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding all in-service Build-for-Sale
properties) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

The decrease in occupancy at December 31, 2008, as compared to December 31, 2007, is primarily the
result of developments which were not fully leased being placed in service during 2008. Certain of these developments were built with the intention to sell shortly after completion but, due to economic conditions, were not sold and are being held as
rental properties for the foreseeable future. Our ongoing ability to maintain favorable occupancy levels may be adversely affected by the impact of workforce reductions triggered by the current economic downturn on current and prospective tenants
and such a reduction in the level of occupancy may have an adverse impact on revenues from rental operations. There are no significant differences in occupancy between wholly owned properties and properties held by unconsolidated subsidiaries.

Lease Expiration and Renewals:

Our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re-lease
expiring space. The following table reflects our in-service portfolio lease expiration schedule by property type as of December 31, 2008. The table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents (based on December 2008 rental
revenue) under expiring leases (in thousands, except percentage data):

Note: Includes all properties in unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes all Build-for-Sale properties.

We renewed 71.9% and 79.7% of our leases up for renewal totaling approximately 9.2 million and 9.8 million
square feet in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We attained 1.80% growth in net effective rents on these renewals during 2008. Excluding the effect of one significant 322,679 square foot early lease renewal in certain of our office properties, our
growth in net effective rents for 2008 would have been 4.90%, which is more consistent with our 2007 growth in net effective rent rate upon renewal of 5.81%. Our lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent
at a 70-80% success rate. The effects of current economic conditions upon our base of existing tenants may adversely affect our ability to continue to achieve this renewal rate.

Future Development:

Another source of our earnings growth is our wholly owned and joint venture development activities. We expect to generate future earnings through income upon the sale of these
development properties or from Rental Operations income as the development properties are placed in service and leased. Considering the current state of the economy and the risks presented by constraints on our ability to access capital on favorable
terms, if at all, we have reduced the level of our wholly owned new development activities pending improvements in the economy and capital markets and are focused on the lease-up of recently completed and under development projects.

We had 4.0 million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of $729.2 million at December 31, 2008, compared to
16.6 million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007. The square footage and estimated costs include both wholly owned and joint venture development activity at 100%.

The following table summarizes our properties under development as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands, except percentage data):

(1)

Includes total estimated project costs upon completion for wholly owned and joint venture properties, both at 100%.

(2)

Anticipated yield upon leasing 95% of the property.

Acquisition
and Disposition Activity:

Gross sales proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned held-for-rental properties were $79.4 million in 2008, compared to $336.7 million in 2007. Proceeds from 2007 included the disposition of a portfolio
of eight office properties in the Cleveland market and a portfolio of twelve industrial properties in the St. Louis market.

Dispositions of wholly owned
Build-for-Sale properties resulted in $346.8 million in proceeds in 2008, compared to $256.6 million in 2007. This increase was largely a result of $225.9 million in current year proceeds from seven buildings sold to a 20% owned unconsolidated joint
venture with which we have an agreement to sell up to $800.0 million in Build-for-Sale properties over a three-year period.

- 24 -


Our share of proceeds from sales of properties within unconsolidated joint ventures, in which we have less than a 100%
interest, totaled $35.1 million in 2008, compared to $25.9 million in 2007.

We intend to continue to identify properties for disposition in order to
recycle the proceeds into higher yielding assets and to reduce our debt maturities. We believe that the number of dispositions we execute in 2009 will be impacted by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain favorable financing given the current
state of the economy and credit markets in particular.

In 2008, we acquired $60.5 million of income producing properties and $42.7 million of undeveloped
land, compared to $117.0 million of income producing properties and $321.3 million of undeveloped land in 2007. In 2007, we also continued our expansion into the healthcare real estate market by completing the acquisition of Bremner Healthcare Real
Estate, a national healthcare development and management firm. The initial consideration paid to the sellers totaled $47.1 million and the sellers may be eligible for further contingent payments over the three years following the acquisition date.

Results of Operations

A summary of our
operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, is as follows (in thousands, except number of properties and per share data):

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2008 to Year Ended December 31, 2007

Rental Revenue from Continuing Operations

Overall, rental revenue
from continuing operations increased from $822.7 million in 2007 to $870.4 million in 2008. The following table reconciles rental revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment to our total reported rental revenue from continuing
operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):

The primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations, with specific references to a
particular segment when applicable, are summarized below:

•

In 2008, we acquired five new properties and placed 36 developments in service. These acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of $3.5 million
and $20.4 million, respectively.

- 25 -


•

Acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in 2007 provided $10.3 million and $37.7 million, respectively, of incremental revenue in 2008.

•

We sold eight properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in 2007, resulting in an $11.2 million reduction in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008,
as compared to the same period in 2007. Of these properties, seven were sold in the second quarter of 2007 and one was sold in the fourth quarter of 2007.

•

Rental revenue from continuing operations includes lease termination fees. Lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease
obligations before the end of the contractual lease term. Lease termination fees decreased from $24.2 million in 2007 to $9.4 million in 2008.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in
unconsolidated companies. These unconsolidated companies generally own and operate rental properties and develop properties. Equity in earnings decreased from $29.4 million in 2007 to $23.8 million in 2008 largely as the result of our $7.0 million
share of additional depreciation expense recognized when two properties owned by unconsolidated companies were removed from held-for-sale classification. The additional depreciation expense was partially offset by an increase in gain on building
sales in 2008 compared to 2007. During 2007, our joint ventures sold ten non-strategic buildings, with our share of the net gain recognized through equity in earnings totaling $8.0 million, compared to five joint venture building sales in 2008, with
$10.1 million recorded to equity in earnings for our share of the net gains.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations for the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):

Of the overall $15.9 million increase in rental expenses in 2008 compared to 2007, $11.5 million was attributable
to properties acquired and developments placed in service from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2008. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in rental expenses of $2.0 million resulting from the sale of eight properties to
an unconsolidated joint venture in 2007. Increases in utility costs and snow removal in our existing base of properties also contributed to the increase in rental expenses.

Of the overall $11.3 million increase in real estate taxes in 2008 compared to 2007, $7.0 million was attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from January 1, 2007 through
December 31, 2008. The remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in taxes on our existing properties.

- 26 -


Interest Expense

Interest expense from continuing operations increased from $172.0 million in 2007 to $195.1 million in 2008. The increase is primarily the result of interest costs related to development projects that were placed in service in late 2007 and
2008 where the costs to finance these projects were capitalized during construction. Overall, our weighted average interest rates remained fairly consistent from 2007 to 2008, as the weighted average interest rate on our unsecured notes increased
from 5.73% to 5.93%, while we experienced lower interest rates throughout 2008 on our LIBOR-based unsecured lines of credit.

Depreciation and
Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization increased from $272.8 million in 2007 to $311.3 million in 2008 due to increases in our
held-for-rental asset base from acquisitions and developments placed in service during 2007 and 2008 as well as the result of recording additional depreciation expense in the amount of $13.2 million for properties removed from held-for-sale
classification in 2008.

Service Operations

Service Operations primarily consist of sales of Build-for-Sale properties and the leasing, management, construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. These operations are heavily
influenced by the current state of the economy, as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners. Earnings from
Service Operations increased from $52.0 million in 2007 to $61.9 million in 2008. The increase in earnings from Service Operations was primarily the result of a $4.4 million increase in pre-tax gains on dispositions of Build-for-Sale properties and
lower income tax expense in our taxable REIT subsidiary.

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased from $37.7 million in 2007 to $39.5 million in 2008. General and administrative expenses consist of two components. The
first component is direct expenses that are not attributable to specific assets such as legal fees, audit fees, marketing costs, investor relations expenses and other corporate overhead. The second component is the unallocated indirect costs
determined to be unrelated to the operation of our owned properties and Service Operations. Those indirect costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative
expenses was largely driven by a $10.9 million decrease in overhead costs allocated to leasing and construction activity based on decreased volume in these areas. Offsetting the decreased allocation of general and administrative expenses to
operating activities was a $9.1 million decrease in total overhead costs in 2008 as we focused on overhead reduction opportunities.

Impairment Charges
and Other Expenses

Impairment charges and other expenses consist of impairment charges recognized on our long-lived assets as well as the write-off of
previously capitalized costs of potential projects that we determined are no longer likely to be pursued. The increase from $5.7 million in 2007 to $19.7 million in 2008 was largely the result of a re-assessment of our intended use of some of our
land holdings, as well as the negative effect of the overall economy on real estate values in certain of our markets. We recognized non-cash impairment charges in 2008 on seven of our tracts of undeveloped land totaling $8.6 million. Additionally,
as the result of the economy’s negative effect on real estate selling prices, we recognized $2.8 million of impairment charges on two of our Build-for-Sale properties that were under construction at December 31, 2008, as they were expected
to sell in 2009. The fair values of these assets were calculated either by discounting estimated future cash flows and sales proceeds or were based on comparable transactions.

The remaining $8.3 million and $5.7 million of activity in 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily pertained to costs previously capitalized for potential projects that we later determined would not be pursued.

- 27 -


Discontinued Operations

The results of operations for properties sold during the year to unrelated parties or classified as held-for-sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations. The property specific components of
earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes, allocated interest expense, depreciation expense and minority interest, as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of
properties.

The operations of 61 buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations. These 61 properties consist of 35 industrial and 26 office
properties. As a result, we classified net income from operations, net of minority interest, of $1.6 million, $4.1 million and $10.7 million in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Of these properties, eight were sold during 2008, 32 properties were sold during 2007 and 21 properties were sold during 2006. The gains on disposal of
these properties, net of minority interest, of $16.1 million, $113.6 million and $42.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are also reported in discontinued operations.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2007 to Year Ended December 31, 2006

Rental Revenue from Continuing Operations

Overall, rental revenue from continuing operations increased from $767.3
million in 2006 to $822.7 million in 2007. The following table reconciles rental revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment to our total reported rental revenue from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively (in thousands):

The primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations, with specific references to a
particular segment when applicable, are summarized below:

•

In 2007, we acquired six new properties and placed 38 development projects in service. These acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of $2.9
million and $16.6 million, respectively.

•

Acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in 2006 provided $12.4 million and $25.1 million, respectively, of incremental revenue in 2007.

•

We acquired an additional 31 properties in 2006 and later sold them to an unconsolidated joint venture, resulting in a $40.2 million reduction in revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the same period in 2006. Of these properties, 23 were sold in the fourth quarter of 2006, seven were sold in the second quarter of 2007 and one was sold in the fourth quarter of 2007.

•

Rental revenue includes lease termination fees. Lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end
of the contractual lease term. Lease termination fees increased from $16.1 million in 2006 to $24.2 million in 2007.

•

The remaining increase in rental revenues is primarily the result of an $18.2 million increase in revenues from reimbursable rental expenses. This increase is
largely offset by a corresponding increase in overall rental expenses.

- 28 -


Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies. These joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and develop properties. These earnings
decreased from $38.0 million in 2006 to $29.4 million in 2007. During 2006, our joint ventures sold 22 non-strategic buildings, with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling $18.8 million, compared to ten joint venture
building sales in 2007, with $8.0 million recorded to equity in earnings for our share of net gains.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively (in thousands):

Our rental expenses increased by $8.0 million in 2007 compared to 2006. A $9.9 million increase in rental expenses
attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007 was largely offset by a reduction in rental expenses of $7.6 million resulting from the contribution of 31 properties to
an unconsolidated joint venture in 2006 and 2007. Inclement weather conditions in the first quarter of 2007, an increase in utility rates and volume in the third quarter of 2007 due to unseasonably high temperatures and normal inflationary factors
triggered the remaining increase in rental expenses.

Of the overall $14.5 million increase in real estate taxes in 2007 compared to 2006, $7.7 million was
attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007. The remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in taxes on our existing properties.

Interest Expense

Interest expense from continuing operations
remained fairly consistent from 2006 to 2007 at $172.7 million in 2006, compared to $172.0 million in 2007. While we maintained higher outstanding borrowings in 2007 compared to 2006, these higher borrowings were used to fund our increase in
development activities and thus, the increased interest costs from these borrowings were capitalized into project costs rather than expensed.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization increased from $236.8 million in 2006 to $272.8 million in 2007 due to
increases in our held-for-rental asset base from acquisitions and developments placed in service during 2006 and 2007.

- 29 -


Service Operations

Earnings from Service Operations decreased slightly from $53.2 million in 2006 to $52.0 million in 2007. During 2007, we generated pre-tax gains of $34.7 million from the sale of 15 Build-for-Sale properties compared
to $44.6 million from the sale of nine such properties in 2006. Partially offsetting this decrease was a $2.9 million reduction in income taxes on these gains on sale, with the net effect of decreased gains on sale in 2007 resulting in a $7.0
million decrease in earnings from Service Operations. Increased net general contractor revenues drove a $9.7 million increase in earnings from Service Operations from 2006 as the result of increased volume and margins and favorable settlement of
previously existing warranty reserves.

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased from $35.8 million in 2006 to $37.7 million in 2007. There was a $31.7 million increase in total overhead costs in 2007 as the result of our overall growth. The majority of
this increase in the total overhead costs was a result of increased rental and service operations activity and thus, was allocated to rental operations, construction, development and leasing. Approximately $1.5 million of the increase in total
overhead costs was not allocated to operations, which was the primary reason for the overall $1.9 million increase to general and administrative expense.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience. Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our Audit Committee and
independent auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic
conditions:

Accounting for Joint Ventures:

We analyze our investments in joint ventures under Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation. To the extent that our joint ventures
do not qualify as variable interest entities, we further assess under the guidelines of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a
Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF 04-5”); Statement of Position 78-9,

Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures

(“SOP 78-9”); Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

; and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 94,

Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries,

to determine if the venture should be
consolidated. We have equity interests generally ranging from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated joint ventures that develop, own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. To the extent applicable, we consolidate those joint ventures
that are considered to be variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. For non-variable interest entities, we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing
entity and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day-to-day operations, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent
of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner. We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial policies. Under the equity method
of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

- 30 -


To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost
basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in
our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. In accordance with the provisions of SOP 78-9 and SFAS No. 66,

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate

, we recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures,
relating solely to the outside partner’s interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

Cost Capitalization:

Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with and incremental to the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete
and ready for its intended use. We believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry. The interest rate used
to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.

We also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs,
on vacant space during extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space
cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended
lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy. In addition, all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are
capitalized.

In assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department basis, among
activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction, development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate
functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs
are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.

To ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards consist of a
percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease. These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the
departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized.

Impairment of Real Estate Assets:

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted
cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is
based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our
properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of

- 31 -


our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy
changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset
group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value. The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective,
especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions.

Real estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the
lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

Acquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets:

In
accordance with SFAS 141,

Business Combinations

, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values.

The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management’s determination of the value of the property as if it were
vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to
execute similar leases. The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and the value of
customer relationships.

•

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using an interest rate which
reflects the risks associated with the lease) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using
current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the
balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

•

The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and to customer relationship values, based upon management’s assessment of
their respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as
applicable.

Valuation of Receivables:

We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of
outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform in-house credit reviews and analyses on major existing tenants and all significant prospective tenants before leases are executed. We have established the following procedures and
policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances:

•

We maintain a tenant “watch list” containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk. Various
factors such as late rent payments, lease or debt instrument defaults, and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list.

•

As a matter of policy, we reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90 days.

•

Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long-term risk, regardless of the status of rent
receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

- 32 -


Construction Contracts:

We recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on
the percentage of completion method. Using this method, profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts. A portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our
estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract. Cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract’s term. This revenue recognition
method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes.

With regard to
critical accounting policies, management has discussed the following with the Audit Committee:

•

Criteria for identifying and selecting our critical accounting policies;

•

Methodology in applying our critical accounting policies; and

•

Impact of the critical accounting policies on our financial statements.

The Audit Committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Sources of Liquidity

We expect to
meet our short-term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months, including payments of dividends and distributions, as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to maintaining our current real estate assets, primarily through working
capital and net cash provided by operating activities.

We expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt
maturities, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and other non-recurring capital improvements, primarily from the following sources:

•

undistributed cash provided by operating activities;

•

issuance of additional equity, including common and preferred shares;

•

issuance of additional debt securities, including secured debt;

•

proceeds received from real estate dispositions; and

•

transactions with unconsolidated entities.

Due to
the current disruption in the U.S. economy, we are constantly monitoring the state of the capital markets and actively managing our capital needs, such as development expenditures and commitments. We will continue to utilize the Duke Realty Limited
Partnership (“DRLP”) $1.3 billion unsecured revolving line of credit to complete development projects currently under construction. We have virtually halted all new development activity and are focused on the completion and lease-up of
under construction and recently completed projects. In January 2009, we announced a reduction in our annual dividend from $1.94 per share to $1.00 per share, which will result in approximately $145.2 million of additional undistributed cash on an
annual basis. We anticipate using multiple sources of capital, including issuances of secured debt in the near future, to meet our long-term capital needs.

Rental Operations

We believe our primary source of liquidity, cash flows from Rental Operations, provides a stable source of cash to
fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts
from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition.

- 33 -


We are subject to a number of risks as a result of the current economic downturn, including reduced occupancy, tenant
defaults and bankruptcies, and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, each of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations. These risks may be heightened as a result of the current economic
conditions. However, we believe that these risks may be mitigated by our relatively strong market presence in most of our markets and the fact that we perform in-house credit reviews and analyses on major tenants and all significant leases before
they are executed.

stated rate on the amounts outstanding on the DRLP unsecured line of credit as of December 31, 2008 was LIBOR plus .525% (ranging from 1.005% to 2.355% as of December 31, 2008). We may, at our sole discretion, exercise an option to extend
the maturity date to January 2011. This line of credit also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge, variable rate indebtedness, consolidated
net worth and debt-to-net asset value. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

Due to the
current volatile state of the credit markets, the borrowing cost of future secured or unsecured debt issuances may be higher, for the foreseeable future, than what has been historically available. We anticipate that additional issuances, in the near
term, will be in the form of secured debt offerings.

In February 2008, we issued $300.0 million of 8.375% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares.

In May 2008, we issued $325.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due in May 2013. After taking into account the effect of forward starting swaps,
which were designated as cash flow hedges for this offering, the notes had an effective interest rate of 7.36%.

The indentures (and related supplemental
indentures) governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants, as well as applicable covenants under our unsecured
line of credit, as of December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form
S-3, relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of DRLP’s debt securities (including guarantees thereof) and the Company’s common shares, preferred shares, depository shares, warrants, stock purchase
contracts and units comprised of one or more of these securities. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long-term debt
upon maturity.

Sale of Real Estate Assets

We
utilize sales of real estate assets as an additional source of liquidity. We pursue opportunities to sell real estate assets at favorable prices to capture value created by us as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio by recycling
sale proceeds into new properties with greater value creation opportunities.

In 2008, our capital recycling program was significantly reduced due to the
current state of the economy and the credit markets and it is likely that this trend will continue in 2009.

- 34 -


Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities

Transactions with unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity. From time to time we will sell properties to an unconsolidated entity, while retaining a continuing interest in that
entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to the interest that we do not own. Additionally, unconsolidated entities will from time to time obtain debt financing and will distribute to us, and our partners, all or a portion of the proceeds.

In May 2008, we entered into an unconsolidated joint venture that will acquire up to $800.0 million of our newly developed build-to-suit projects over a
three-year period. Properties will be sold to the joint venture upon completion, lease commencement and satisfaction of other customary conditions. We will retain a 20% equity interest in the joint venture. As of December 31, 2008, the joint
venture has acquired seven properties from us and we received year-to-date net sale proceeds and financing distributions of approximately $251.6 million.

In January 2008, we sold a tract of land to an unconsolidated joint venture in which we hold a 50% equity interest and received a distribution, commensurate to our partner’s 50% ownership interest, of approximately $38.3 million. In
November 2008, that unconsolidated joint venture entered a loan agreement with a consortium of banks and distributed a portion of the loan proceeds to us and our partner, with our share of the distribution totaling $20.4 million.

Uses of Liquidity

Our principal uses of liquidity include the
following:

•

property investment;

•

recurring leasing/capital costs;

•

dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;

•

long-term debt maturities;

•

opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt; and

•

other contractual obligations.

Property
Investment

We evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to
make future property investments is dependent upon our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity including the issuances of debt or equity securities as well as disposing of selected properties. In light of current economic
conditions, management continues to evaluate our investment priorities and we are limiting new development expenditures.

Recurring Expenditures

One of our principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the recurring leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments. The following is a
summary of our recurring capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively (in thousands):

- 35 -


Dividends and Distributions

In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must currently distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to shareholders. Because depreciation is a non-cash expense, cash flow will typically be
greater than operating income. We paid dividends per share of $1.93, $1.91 and $1.89 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect to continue to distribute taxable earnings to meet the requirements to maintain
our REIT status. However, distributions are declared at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our board of
directors deems relevant. In January 2009, our board of directors resolved to decrease our annual dividend from $1.94 per share to $1.00 per share in order to retain additional cash to help meet our capital needs. We anticipate retaining additional
cash of approximately $145.2 million per year, when compared to an annual dividend of $1.94 per share, as the result of this action.

At December 31,
2008 we had six series of preferred shares outstanding. The annual dividend rates on our preferred shares range between 6.5% and 8.375% and are paid in arrears quarterly.

Debt Maturities

Debt outstanding at December 31, 2008 totaled $4.3 billion with a weighted average
interest rate of 5.43% maturing at various dates through 2028. We had $3.3 billion of unsecured debt, $483.7 million outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit and $507.4 million of secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2008. Scheduled
principal amortization and maturities of such debt totaled $319.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

The following is a summary of the
scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at December 31, 2008 (in thousands, except percentage data):

(1)

The balance outstanding on the DRLP unsecured line of credit is included in debt maturities for 2010. This line of credit may be extended to 2011 at our option.

We anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from rental operations, which will
increase as the result of reducing our annual dividends and development expenditures, as well as through raising additional capital which, in the near term, is expected to occur mainly through the issuance of secured debt and through asset
dispositions.

Opportunistic Repurchases of Outstanding Debt

We intend to repurchase, when favorable pricing is available, outstanding unsecured debt maturing over the next three years.

- 36 -


Historical Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents were $22.5 million and $48.0 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in
millions):

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our Rental Operations and Service Operations activities. The receipt of rental income from Rental Operations
continues to provide the primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows. In addition, we develop buildings with the intent to sell them at or soon after completion, which provides another significant source of operating cash flow activity.
Highlights of such activity are as follows:

•

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred Build-for-Sale property development costs of $216.1 million, compared to $281.1 million and $281.7 million
for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease is a result of lower activity in our Build-for-Sale business. Build-for-Sale projects under construction as of December 31, 2008 had anticipated total costs upon
completion of $220.6 million, of which $138.5 million has not yet been incurred as of December 31, 2008.

•

We sold 14 Build-for-Sale properties in 2008 compared to 15 in 2007 and nine in 2006, receiving net proceeds of $343.0 million, $232.6 million and $181.8 million,
respectively. We recognized pre-tax gains of $39.1 million, $34.7 million and $49.0 million on these sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

•

Net cash flows from third party construction contracts increased by $151.7 million from 2007. The increase was largely driven by $105.1 million in cash proceeds
from the 2008 sale of a parcel of land to the U.S. Department of the Army in conjunction with the BRAC Construction Contract.

Investing Activities

Investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity. Development and acquisition activities
typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:

•

Sales of land and depreciated property provided $116.6 million in net proceeds in 2008, compared to $480.9 million in 2007 and $180.8 million in 2006. We sold
portfolios of eight suburban office properties in our Cleveland market and twelve industrial properties in our St. Louis market during 2007, which together provided $203.5 million of the net proceeds received in 2007.

•

We received capital distributions (as a result of the sale of properties or refinancing) from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $95.4 million in 2008, compared to
$235.8 million in 2007 and $296.6 million in 2006.

•

Development expenditures for our held-for-rental portfolio totaled $436.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $451.2 million and $385.5
million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

- 37 -


•

During 2008, we paid cash of $20.1 million for real estate acquisitions, compared to $117.4 million in 2007 and $735.3 million in 2006. In addition, we paid cash of
$40.9 million for undeveloped land in 2008, compared to $317.3 million in 2007 and $435.9 million in 2006. The cash paid for real estate acquisitions in 2007 included both $36.1 million for the Bremner acquisition (with the remaining $11.0 million
paid through the issuance of Units in Duke Realty Limited Partnership) and $55.4 million for a portfolio of industrial properties located in Seattle, Virginia and Houston. The most significant activity in 2006 consisted of the purchase of a
portfolio of suburban office and light industrial properties and undeveloped land in the Washington, D.C. area for $867.6 million (of which $713.5 million was paid in cash) and the purchase of a portfolio of industrial properties in Savannah,
Georgia for $196.2 million (of which $125.9 million was paid in cash).

Financing Activities

The following items highlight significant capital transactions:

•

In January 2008, we repaid $125.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 3.36% on their scheduled maturity date.

•

In February 2008, we received net proceeds of approximately $290.0 million from the issuance of our 8.375% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares; we
issued no preferred shares in 2007.

•

We decreased net borrowings on DRLP’s $1.3 billion line of credit by $69.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to an increase of $226.0
million for the same period in 2007.

•

In March 2008, we settled three forward-starting swaps and made a cash payment of $14.6 million to the counterparties.

•

In May 2008, we repaid $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 6.76% on their scheduled maturity date.

•

In May 2008, we issued $325.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due in May 2013. After including the effect of forward starting interest rate swaps, the
effective interest rate is 7.36%.

•

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we opportunistically repurchased preferred shares from all outstanding series in the open market in order to take advantage of
the significant discounts at which they were trading. In total, we repurchased preferred shares having a redemption value of approximately $27.4 million for $12.4 million, which resulted in an approximate $14.0 million gain on repurchase after
considering the charge-off of offering costs from those shares.

•

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we also repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes maturing in 2009 and 2010 on the open market. We
repurchased unsecured notes that had a face value of approximately $38.5 million, for approximately $36.5 million, and recognized a gain on extinguishment of these notes of approximately $2.0 million.

Credit Ratings

We are currently assigned investment grade corporate
credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group. Our senior unsecured notes have been assigned ratings of BBB and Baa2 by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and
Moody’s Investors Service, respectively.

Our preferred shares carry ratings of BB+ and Baa3 from Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and
Moody’s Investors Service, respectively.

The ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred shares could change based upon, among other things,
the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition.

- 38 -


Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in Unconsolidated Companies

We have equity interests
generally ranging from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. Our unconsolidated subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the operations and development of
Industrial, Office and Retail real estate properties. We hold interests both in joint ventures that operate real estate for long-term investment and rental income (“Operating Joint Ventures”) as well as joint ventures that develop
properties with the intent to sell within a relatively short period of time after completion and lease-up (“Development Joint Ventures”). The equity method of accounting (see Critical Accounting Policies) is used for these investments in
which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies. As a result, the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet. Total assets of our
unconsolidated subsidiaries were $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Our investments in and advances to
unconsolidated companies represents approximately 9% and 8% of our total assets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These investments provide several benefits to us, including increased market share, tenant and property
diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects.

The following table presents summarized financial information for
unconsolidated companies for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (“special purpose
entities”) that have been established solely for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.

- 39 -


Contractual Obligations

At December 31, 2008, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below:

(1)

Our long-term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest
rate at December 31, 2008.

(2)

Our unsecured lines of credit consist of an operating line of credit that matures January 2010 and the line of credit of a consolidated subsidiary that matures July 2011. We may, at
our option, extend the term of our operating line of credit by one year. Interest expense for our unsecured lines of credit was calculated using the most recent stated interest rates that were in effect.

(3)

Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at
December 31, 2008.

(4)

Represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of held-for-rental, Build-for-Sale and third-party construction projects.

(5)

These land acquisitions are subject to the completion of due diligence requirements, resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions. In most
cases, we may withdraw from land purchase contracts and the seller’s only recourse is earnest money deposits that we have already paid.

(6)

Represents other contractual obligations.

Related Party
Transactions

We provide property management, leasing, construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have
equity interests. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, we earned management fees of $7.8 million, $7.1 million and $4.4 million, leasing fees of $2.8 million, $4.2 million and $2.9 million and construction and
development fees of $12.7 million, $13.1 million and $19.1 million from these companies. We recorded these fees based on contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of
these fees in the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have guaranteed the repayment of $68.1 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We
will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make
any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

We also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of nine of our
unconsolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2008, the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately $255.1 million. Additionally, we guaranteed $29.0 million of secured indebtedness related to a property sold to a third party in
2006. Management believes that the value of the underlying real estate exceeds the associated loan balances and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees.

We have entered into agreements, subject to the completion of due diligence requirements, resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions, for the future acquisitions of land
totaling $8.0 million. In most cases, we may withdraw from land purchase contracts and the seller’s only recourse is earnest money deposits that we have already paid.

- 40 -


In October 2000, we sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair value of $487.0 million to
a joint venture (Dugan Realty LLC) in which we have a 50% interest and recognized a net gain of $35.2 million. In connection with this transaction, the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to a $50.0 million interest in the joint
venture to us in exchange for our common stock or cash (at our option), subject to certain timing and other restrictions. As a result of this put option, we deferred $10.2 million of gain on sale of depreciated property and recorded a $50.0 million
liability.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount
of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2008, the FASB ratified FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible
Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)

(“FSP APB 14-1”) that will require separate accounting for the debt and equity components of convertible instruments. FSP APB 14-1 will
require that the value assigned to the debt component would be the estimated fair value of a similar bond without the conversion feature, which would result in the debt being recorded at a discount. The resulting debt discount will be amortized over
the period during which the debt is expected to be outstanding (i.e., through the first optional redemption date) as additional non-cash interest expense. FSP APB 14-1 is effective January 1, 2009 and will be applied retrospectively. We
currently estimate that FSP APB 14-1 will result in us recognizing additional non-cash interest expense of between $5.5 million and $7.5 million per annum.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

We are exposed to interest
rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long-term debt borrowings. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To
achieve our objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do
not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. Our two outstanding swaps, that fixed the rates on two of our variable rate loans, were not significant to the Financial Statements in terms of notional amount or fair
value at December 31, 2008.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts (in
thousands) of the expected annual maturities, weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period, fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate
changes.

As the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2008, it does not consider those
exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and
interest rates.

- 41 -


At December 31, 2007 the redemption value of our unsecured notes was $3.2 billion and we estimated the fair value of
those unsecured notes to be $3.1 billion. Our unsecured notes are thinly traded and our estimate of the fair value of those notes, when compared to the redemption values of those notes, has declined significantly since December 31, 2007 largely
as the result of recent comparable trades at significant discounts as well as overall market conditions having the effect of increasing credit spreads.

Interest expense on our unsecured lines of credit will be affected by future fluctuations in the LIBOR indices. The interest rate at such point in the future as we may renew, extend or replace our unsecured lines of credit and other
long-term debt borrowings will be heavily dependent upon the state of the credit environment.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The financial statements and supplementary
data are included under Item 15 of this Report.

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on
Accounting and Financial Disclosure

There was no change or disagreement with our accountants related to our accounting and financial disclosures.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as of the end of the period covered by this Report. The controls evaluation was done
under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer.

Attached as
exhibits to this Report are certifications of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This Controls and Procedures section includes
the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) are controls and other
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on the disclosure controls and procedures evaluation referenced above, our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting and the audit report of our registered public accounting firm are included in Item 15 of Part IV under the headings
“Management’s Report on Internal Control” and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,” respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
controls over financial reporting.

Item 9B.  Other Information

There was no information required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of 2008 for which no Form 8-K was filed.

Management’s Report on Internal Control

We, as management of Duke Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Duke”), are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and
procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2008 based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control – Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on such
evaluation, we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.

The
independent registered public accounting firm of KPMG LLP, as auditors of Duke’s consolidated financial statements, has also issued an audit report on Duke’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Shareholders and Directors of

Duke Realty Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007
and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
also have audited the financial statement schedule III. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Duke Realty Corporation and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule III, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
Also in our opinion, Duke Realty Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)

The Company

Our Rental Operations (see
Note 8) are conducted through Duke Realty Limited Partnership (“DRLP”). We owned approximately 95.6% of the common partnership interests of DRLP (“Units”) at December 31, 2008. The remaining Units in DRLP are redeemable for
shares of our common stock on a one-to-one basis and earn dividends at the same rate as shares of our common stock. We conduct our Service Operations (see Note 8) through Duke Realty Services LLC and Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership, of
which we are the sole general partner and of which DRLP is the sole limited partner. We also conduct Service Operations through Duke Construction Limited Partnership, which is effectively 100% owned by DRLP. The consolidated financial statements
include our accounts and our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries, and the terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Duke Realty Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) and those entities owned or
controlled by the Company.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our controlled
subsidiaries. The equity interests in these controlled subsidiaries not owned by us are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements. Investments in entities that we do not control through majority voting interest or where the other owner has substantial participating rights are not consolidated and are reflected as investments in unconsolidated
companies under the equity method of reporting.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for 2007 and 2006 have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 consolidated
financial statement presentation.

Real Estate Investments

Rental real property, including land, land improvements, buildings and tenant improvements, are included in real estate investments and are generally
stated at cost. Construction in process and undeveloped land are included in real estate investments and are stated at cost. Real estate investments also include our equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental
properties and hold land for development.

Depreciation

Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated life not to exceed 40 and 15 years, respectively, and
tenant improvement costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the term of the related lease.

Cost Capitalization

Direct and certain indirect costs clearly associated with and incremental to the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real
estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. In addition, all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized. We capitalize a portion of our indirect costs associated with our
construction, development and leasing efforts. In assessing the amount of direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. We do not capitalize any costs
attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects.

- 62 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We capitalize direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a
property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In addition, we capitalize costs, including real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities, that have been allocated to vacant space based on the square
footage of the portion of the building not held available for immediate occupancy during the extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended
use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer
capitalized.

We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the
completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.

Impairment

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are
directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other
things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our
anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a
reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of
undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value. The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of
recent comparable transactions.

Real estate assets classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their
fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Once a property is designated as held-for-sale, no further depreciation expense is recorded.

Purchase Accounting

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets
based on their respective fair values, based on all pertinent information available and adjusted based on changes in that information in no event to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant
improvements and land) is based upon management’s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management include an
estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated among three categories of intangible assets
consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and the value of customer relationships.

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference
between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its

- 63 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

remaining term and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The
amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining
terms of the respective leases.

The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and to customer
relationship values based upon management’s assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of the existing lease,
or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable.

Joint Ventures

We analyze our investments in joint ventures under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation. To the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities, we
further assess under the guidelines of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited
Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF 04-5”); Statement of Position 78-9,

Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures

(“SOP 78-9”); Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial
Statements

; and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 94,

Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries,

to determine if the venture should be consolidated. We have equity interests generally ranging
from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated joint ventures that develop, own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. We consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be variable interest entities where we are the primary
beneficiary. For non-variable interest entities, we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing member and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is
further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day-to-day operations, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the
general partner. We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our
balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the
basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. In accordance with the provisions of SOP 78-9 and SFAS
No. 66,

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate

(“SFAS 66”), we recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner’s interest, to the extent the economic
substance of the transaction is a sale.

Cash Equivalents

Investments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Valuation of Receivables

We
reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90 days. Additional reserves are recorded for more current amounts, as applicable, where we have determined collectability to be
doubtful. Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant with long-term risk, regardless of the status of rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Deferred Costs

Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are amortized to interest expense on the straight-line method, which approximates a constant spread
over the term of the related loan. All direct and indirect costs, including estimated internal costs, associated with the leasing of real estate investments owned by us are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease. We include
lease incentive costs, which are payments made on behalf of a tenant to sign a lease, in deferred leasing costs and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms as a reduction of rental revenues. We include as lease
incentives amounts funded to construct tenant improvements owned by the tenant. Unamortized costs are charged to expense upon the early termination of the lease or upon early payment of the financing.

Minority Interest

Minority
interests relate to the minority ownership interests in DRLP and interests in consolidated property partnerships that are not wholly owned. Minority interest is subsequently adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to minority holders
and the minority holders’ proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity.

The value of each DRLP Unit
that is redeemed is measured on the date of its redemption and the difference between the aggregate book value and the purchase price of the Units increases the recorded value of our net assets.

Revenues

Rental
Operations

The timing of revenue recognition under an operating lease is determined based upon ownership of the tenant improvements.
If we are the owner of the tenant improvements, revenue recognition commences after the improvements are completed and the tenant takes possession or control of the space. In contrast, if we determine that the tenant allowances we are funding are
lease incentives, then we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant. Rental income from leases with free rental periods or scheduled rental increases during their terms is recognized on a
straight-line basis.

We record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the
payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us.

Service
Operations

Management fees are based on a percentage of rental receipts of properties managed and are recognized as the rental
receipts are collected. Maintenance fees are based upon established hourly rates and are recognized as the services are performed. Construction management and development fees represent fee-based third-party contracts and are recognized as earned
based on the terms of the contract, which approximates the percentage of completion method.

We recognize income on construction contracts
where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method. Using this method, profits are recorded based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under the
contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. Changes in job
performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

- 65 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Unbilled receivables on construction contracts totaled $22.7 million and $33.1 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Property Sales

Gains on sales of all properties are recognized in accordance with SFAS 66.

The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria
in SFAS 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance from the seller associated with the properties. We make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as
to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize considering factors such as continuing ownership interest we may have with the buyer (“partial sales”) and our level of future involvement with the property or the
buyer that acquires the assets. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the full
accrual sales criteria are met. Estimated future costs to be incurred after completion of each sale are included in the determination of the gain on sales.

Gains from sales of depreciated property are included in discontinued operations and the proceeds from the sale of these held-for-rental properties are classified in the investing activities section of the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Gains or losses from our sale of properties that were developed or repositioned with the intent to
sell and not for long-term rental (“Build-for-Sale” properties) are classified as gain on sale of Build-for-Sale properties in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All activities and proceeds received from the development and sale of
these buildings are classified in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Net Income Per
Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available for common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the sum of net income available for common shareholders and the minority interest in earnings allocable to Units not
owned by us, by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and minority Units outstanding, including any potential dilutive securities for the period.

The following table reconciles the components of basic and diluted net income per common share (in thousands):

(1)

Excludes (in thousands of shares) 7,731, 780 and 719 of anti-dilutive shares for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also excludes the 3.75%
Exchangeable Senior Notes due November 2011 (“Exchangeable Notes”) issued in 2006, that have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

A joint venture partner in one of our unconsolidated companies has the option to convert a portion of its ownership in the joint venture to our common
shares. The effect of this option on earnings per share was anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Federal Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To qualify as a
REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our adjusted taxable income to our stockholders. Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to
maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we are entitled to a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends we pay to shareholders. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we distribute an amount equal to or in
excess of our taxable income currently to shareholders. We are also generally subject to federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will
be subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.

REIT qualification reduces,
but does not eliminate, the amount of state and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a dividends paid deduction and are subject to corporate
federal, state and local income taxes. As a REIT, we may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes if we engage in certain types of transactions.

The following table reconciles our net income to taxable income before the dividends paid deduction for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands):

Our dividends paid deduction is summarized below (in thousands):

A summary of the tax characterization of the dividends paid for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 follows:

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We recorded federal and state income tax expense (benefit) of $(6.3 million), $9.0 million and $6.8
million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which were primarily attributable to the earnings (loss) of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We paid federal and state income taxes of $3.5 million, $10.1 million and $4.3 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The taxable REIT subsidiaries have no significant deferred income tax or unrecognized tax benefit items.

Stock Based
Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R),

Share Based Payment

, (“SFAS
123(R)”), using the modified prospective application method. Under this method, as of January 1, 2006, we applied the provisions of SFAS 123(R) to new and modified awards, as well as to the nonvested portion of awards granted before the
required effective date and outstanding at such time.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We periodically enter into certain interest rate protection agreements to effectively convert or cap floating rate debt to a fixed rate, and to hedge
anticipated future financing transactions, both of which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. Net amounts paid or received under these agreements are recognized as an adjustment to the interest expense of the corresponding debt. We do
not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

If a derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the
change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective, while the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value is recognized in earnings. Gains and losses on our
interest rate protection agreements are subsequently included in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same periods in which the related interest payments being hedged are recognized in earnings.

We estimate the fair value of derivative instruments using standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option
pricing models and termination cost at each balance sheet date. For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged
item, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of the financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The most significant estimates, as discussed within our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, pertain to the critical assumptions utilized in testing real estate
assets for impairment as well as in estimating the fair value of real estate assets when an impairment event has taken place. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Significant Acquisitions and Dispositions

Acquisitions

We acquired total income producing real estate related assets of $60.5 million, $219.9 million and $948.4
million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, in order to further establish our property positions around strategic port
locations, we purchased a portfolio of five industrial buildings in Seattle, Virginia and Houston, as well as approximately 161 acres of undeveloped land and a 12-acre container storage facility in Houston. The total price was $89.7 million and was
financed in part through assumption of secured debt that had a fair value of $34.3 million. Of the total purchase price, $64.1 million was allocated to in-service real estate assets, $20.0 million was allocated to undeveloped land and the container
storage facility, $5.4 million was allocated to lease related intangible assets, and the remaining amount was allocated to acquired working capital related assets and liabilities. The results of operations for the acquired properties since the date
of acquisition have been included in continuing rental operations in our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, we completed
the acquisition of Bremner Healthcare Real Estate (“Bremner”), a national health care development and management firm. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand our development capabilities within the health care real estate
market. The initial consideration paid to the sellers totaled $47.1 million, and the sellers may be eligible for further contingent payments over a three-year period following the acquisition. Approximately $39.0 million of the total purchase price
was allocated to goodwill, which is attributable to the value of Bremner’s overall development capabilities and its in-place workforce. The results of operations for Bremner since the date of acquisition have been included in continuing
operations in our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2006, we acquired the majority of a Washington, D.C. metropolitan area
portfolio of suburban office and light industrial properties (the “Mark Winkler Portfolio”). The assets acquired for a purchase price of approximately $867.6 million were comprised of 32 in-service properties with approximately
2.9 million square feet for rental, 166 acres of undeveloped land, as well as certain related assets of the Mark Winkler Company, a real estate management company. The acquisition was financed primarily through assumed mortgage loans and new
borrowings. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, as summarized below (in thousands):

In December 2006, we contributed 23 of these in-service properties acquired from the Mark Winkler
Portfolio with a basis of $381.6 million representing real estate investments and acquired lease related intangible assets to two new unconsolidated subsidiaries. Of the remaining nine in-service properties, eight were contributed to these two
unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2007 and one remains in continuing operations as of December 31, 2008. The eight properties contributed in 2007 had a basis of $298.4 million representing real estate investments and acquired lease related
intangible assets, and debt secured by these properties of $146.4 million was also assumed by the unconsolidated subsidiaries.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In the third quarter of 2006, we finalized the purchase of a portfolio of industrial real estate
properties in Savannah, Georgia. We completed a majority of the purchase in January 2006. The assets acquired for a purchase price of approximately $196.2 million were comprised of 18 buildings with approximately 5.1 million square feet for
rental as well as over 60 acres of undeveloped land. The acquisition was financed in part through assumed mortgage loans. The results of operations for the acquired properties since the date of acquisition have been included in continuing rental
operations in our consolidated financial statements.

Dispositions

In March 2007, as part of our capital recycling program, we sold a portfolio of eight suburban office properties totaling 894,000 square feet in the
Cleveland market. The sales price totaled $140.4 million, of which we received net proceeds of $139.3 million. We also sold a portfolio of twelve flex and light industrial properties in July 2007, totaling 865,000 square feet in the St. Louis
market, for a sales price of $65.0 million, of which we received net proceeds of $64.2 million.

Related Party Transactions

We provide
property management, leasing, construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, we earned management fees of $7.8
million, $7.1 million and $4.4 million, leasing fees of $2.8 million, $4.2 million and $2.9 million and construction and development fees of $12.7 million, $13.1 million and $19.1 million from these companies. We recorded these fees based on
contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements.

Investments in Unconsolidated Companies

We
have equity interests generally ranging from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated joint ventures that develop, own and operate rental properties and hold land for development.

Combined summarized financial information for the unconsolidated companies as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, are as follows (in thousands):

Discontinued Operations, Assets Held-for-Sale and Impairments

The operations of 61 buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. These 61 buildings consist of 35 industrial and 26 office properties. Of these
properties, eight were sold during 2008, 32 properties were sold during 2007 and 21 properties were sold during 2006.

We allocate interest
expense to discontinued operations and have included such interest expense in computing income from discontinued operations. Interest expense allocable to discontinued operations includes interest on any secured debt for properties included in
discontinued operations and an allocable share of our consolidated unsecured interest expense for unencumbered properties. The allocation of unsecured interest expense to discontinued operations was based upon the gross book value of the
unencumbered real estate assets included in discontinued operations as it related to the total gross book value of our unencumbered real estate assets.

The following table illustrates operations of the buildings reflected in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

At December 31, 2008, we have classified one in-service property as held-for-sale. The
following table illustrates the aggregate balance sheet information of this held-for-sale property at December 31, 2008 (in thousands):

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

As the result of disruptions in the U.S. economy and the difficulties of potential buyers in
obtaining financing in the volatile credit markets, we determined that 28 properties no longer met the criteria for held-for-sale classification. As the result of removing these properties from held-for-sale classification, we recognized $13.2
million of additional depreciation expense in 2008.

As the result of a re-assessment of our intended use, as well as the negative effect
of the overall economy on real estate values in certain of our markets, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $8.6 million in 2008 on seven of our tracts of undeveloped land. We also recognized $2.8 million of impairment charges on two of our
Build-for-Sale office rental properties that were under construction at December 31, 2008. The fair values of these assets were calculated either by discounting estimated future cash flows and sales proceeds or based on comparable transactions.
All of the non-cash impairment charges recognized in 2008 are included in income from continuing operations.

We recorded impairment
adjustments on depreciable properties of $266,000 in 2006. No impairment adjustments were recorded on depreciable properties in 2007.

Indebtedness

Indebtedness at
December 31, 2008 and 2007 consists of the following (in thousands):

Fixed Rate Secured Debt

As of December 31, 2008, the $507.4 million of secured debt was collateralized by rental properties with a carrying value of $710.5 million and by
letters of credit in the amount of $8.4 million.

The fair value of our fixed rate secured debt as of December 31, 2008 was $438.0
million. We utilized a discounted cash flow methodology in order to determine the fair value of our fixed rate secured debt. The net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on
our estimate of a current market rate represents the difference between the book value and the fair value. Our estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings when considering current
market conditions. The current market rates we utilized were internally estimated; therefore, we have concluded that our determination of fair value for our fixed rate secured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 (as described in Note 14) inputs.

Fixed Rate Unsecured Debt

We took the following actions during 2008 and 2007 as it pertains to our fixed rate unsecured indebtedness:

•

In January 2008, we repaid $125.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 3.36% on their scheduled maturity date.

•

In May 2008, we repaid $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 6.76% on their scheduled maturity date.

- 72 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

•

In May 2008, we issued $325.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due in May 2013. After including the effect of forward starting swaps (see Note 13), which
were designated as cash flow hedges for this offering, the effective interest rate is 7.36%.

•

In August 2007, we repaid $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes on their scheduled maturity date that had an effective interest rate of 7.47%.

•

In September 2007, we issued $300.0 million of 6.50% senior unsecured notes due in January 2018. This issuance was hedged with a forward starting interest rate swap
that was settled and reduced the effective interest rate to 6.16%.

•

In November 2007, we repaid $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes on their scheduled maturity date that had an effective interest rate of 3.63%.

The fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt as of December 31, 2008 was approximately $2.2 billion. We utilized
multiple broker estimates in estimating the fair value. Our unsecured notes are thinly traded and, in many cases, the broker estimates were not based upon comparable transactions. As such, we have determined that our estimation of the fair value of
our fixed rate unsecured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.

The indentures (and related supplemental indentures) governing our
outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2008.

Unsecured Lines of Credit

Our
unsecured lines of credit as of December 31, 2008 are described as follows (in thousands):

We use the DRLP unsecured line of credit to fund development activities, acquire additional rental
properties and provide working capital. This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line, at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain
restrictions. The stated rate on the amounts outstanding on the DRLP unsecured line of credit as of December 31, 2008 was LIBOR plus .525% (ranging from 1.005% to 2.355% as of December 31, 2008). We may, solely at our option, exercise an
option to extend the maturity date to January 2011. This line of credit also contains various financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge, variable rate
indebtedness, consolidated net worth and debt-to-net asset value. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

The consolidated subsidiary’s unsecured line of credit allows for borrowings up to $30.0 million at a rate of LIBOR plus .85% (equal to 1.32% for outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2008). This
unsecured line of credit is used to fund development activities within the consolidated subsidiary and matures in July 2011 with a 12-month extension option.

The fair value of our unsecured lines of credit as of December 31, 2008 was $477.1 million. We utilized a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value. The net present value of the
difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate represents the difference between the book value and the fair value. Our estimate of a current market rate is based
upon the rate, considering current market conditions and our specific credit profile, at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings. The current market rate we utilized was internally estimated; therefore, we have concluded that our
determination of fair value for our unsecured lines of credit was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.

Segment Reporting

We have three reportable
operating segments, the first two of which consist of the ownership and rental of office and industrial real estate investments. The operations of our office and industrial properties, along with our healthcare and retail properties, are
collectively referred to as “Rental Operations”. Our healthcare and retail properties, which do not meet the quantitative thresholds defined in SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

,
are not separately presented as a reportable segment. The third reportable segment consists of our Build-for-Sale operations and providing various real estate services such as property management, maintenance, leasing, development and construction
management to third-party property owners and joint ventures (and is collectively referred to as “Service Operations”). Our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires
different operating strategies and management expertise.

During the period between the completion of development, rehabilitation or
repositioning of a Build-for-Sale property and the date the property is contributed to an unconsolidated company or sold to a third party, the property and its associated rental income and rental expenses are included in the applicable Rental
Operations segment because the primary activity associated with the Build-for-Sale property during that period is rental activities. Upon contribution or sale, the resulting gain or loss is part of the income of the Service Operations business
segment.

Other revenue consists of equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies as well as other operating revenues not identified with
one of our operating segments. Segment FFO information (FFO is defined below) is calculated by subtracting operating expenses attributable to the applicable segment from segment revenues. Non-segment assets consist of corporate assets including
cash, deferred financing costs and investments in unconsolidated companies. Interest expense and other non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual segments in determining our performance measure.

We assess and measure segment operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Funds From Operations (“FFO”), which
management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by
the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from
net income determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other measures derived in accordance with
GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

- 74 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the
value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real
estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously
depreciated real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs
among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes FFO is a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in conjunction
with net income, which remains the primary measure of performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO provides a
useful comparison of the operating performance of our real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.

The following
table shows (i) the revenues and FFO for each of the reportable segments and (ii) a reconciliation of net income available for common shareholders to the calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in

Shareholders’ Equity

We periodically
use the public equity markets to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental properties or to pay down debt. The proceeds of these offerings are contributed to DRLP in exchange for an additional interest in DRLP.

Beginning in August 2007, we issued new shares of common stock under employee and non-employee stock purchase plans, as well as for dividend reinvestment
plans. We received $15.5 million and $6.9 million of proceeds from these share issuances during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In October 2007, we issued 7.0 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $232.7 million.

In February 2008, we issued $300.0 million of 8.375% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and used the net proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance on DRLP’s unsecured line of credit. Our Series O Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Shares have no stated maturity date although they may be redeemed, at our option, beginning in February 2013.

During the fourth
quarter of 2008, pursuant to the share repurchase plan approved by our board of directors, we repurchased 109,500 preferred shares from all of our outstanding series. The preferred shares repurchased had a total redemption value of approximately
$27.4 million, and were repurchased for $12.4 million. In conjunction with the repurchases, approximately $924,000 of offering costs, the ratable portion of total offering costs associated with the repurchased shares, were charged against income
available for common shareholders in the fourth quarter. A net gain of approximately $14.0 million was included in income available to common shareholders. All shares repurchased were retired prior to December 31, 2008.

In October 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7.99% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a liquidation amount of $132.3 million.
Offering costs of $3.5 million were charged against net income available to common shareholders in conjunction with the redemption of these shares.

The following series of preferred shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands, except percentage data):

All series of preferred shares require cumulative distributions and have no stated maturity date

Fixed Stock Option Plans

We had options outstanding under five fixed stock option plans as of December 31, 2008. Additional grants may be made under one of those plans.
Stock option awards granted under our stock based employee and non-employee compensation plans generally vest over five years at 20% per year and have contractual lives of ten years. The exercise price for stock option grants is set at the fair
value of our common stock on the day of grant.

The following table summarizes transactions under our stock option plans as of
December 31, 2008:

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the closing stock price of $10.96 at December 31, 2008, which would have been received by
the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. This amount changes continuously based on the market prices of the stock.

Options granted in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, had a weighted average fair value per option of $1.76, $2.89 and $3.60. As of December 31, 2008, there was $6.3 million of
total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options granted under the plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of 3.59 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively, was approximately $898,000, $5.6 million and $11.3 million. Compensation expense recognized for fixed stock option plans was $3.9 million, $2.3 million and $1.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $2.6 million, $1.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

The fair values of the options were determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the
term of our employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history of and our present expectation of future dividend payouts. Our computation of expected volatility for the valuation of stock options granted in the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is based on historic, and our present expectation of future volatility over a period of time equal to the expected term. The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the
stock options are expected to remain outstanding.

Performance Share Plan

Performance shares were granted under the 2000 Performance Share Plan, with each performance share economically equivalent to one share of our common
stock. The performance shares vest over a five-year period with the vesting percentage for a year dependent upon our attainment of certain predefined levels of earnings growth for such year. The performance shares have a contractual life of five
years. In April 2006, the 2000 Performance Share Plan was amended to provide that awards would be settled in shares of common stock rather than cash. The fair value of existing awards was fixed at the date of the amendment and the fair value of
subsequent awards will be fixed at the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant.

The following table summarizes transactions
for our performance shares for the year ended December 31, 2008:

Compensation expense recognized for Performance Share Plan units was $201,000, $1.3 million and
$1.2 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The total vest date fair value of shares vesting during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $991,000.

Shareholder Value Plan Awards

Our 2005 Shareholder Value Plan (“2005 SVP Plan”), a
sub-plan of our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, was approved by our shareholders in April 2005. Upon vesting, payout of the 2005 Shareholder Value Plan awards will be made in shares of our common stock. Under the 2005 SVP Plan, shareholder value
awards fully vest three years after the date of grant. The number of common shares to be issued may range from 0%-300% of the target shares awarded and will be based upon our total shareholder return for such three-year period as compared to the
S&P 500 Index and the NAREIT Real Estate 50 Index. Each index is weighted at 50%.

Awards made under the 2005 SVP Plan are measured at
fair value, which is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model that was developed to accommodate the unique features of the 2005 SVP Plan. Compensation cost recognized under the 2005 SVP Plan was $2.0 million, $1.5 million and $879,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

Under our
2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and our 2005 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan approved by our shareholders in April 2005, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) may be granted to non-employee directors, executive officers and selected
management employees. An RSU is economically equivalent to one share of our common stock. RSUs generally vest 20% per year over five years, have contractual lives of five years and are payable in shares of our common stock. However, RSUs
granted to existing non-employee directors vest 100% over one year, and have contractual lives of one year. We recognize the value of the granted RSUs over this vesting period as expense.

The following table summarizes transactions for our RSUs, excluding dividend equivalents, for 2008:

Compensation cost recognized for RSUs totaled $4.9 million, $3.0 million and $2.1 million for the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $4.8 million of total
unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs granted under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.7 years.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to
capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes.

In November 2007, we entered into forward starting interest swaps with notional amounts appropriate to hedge interest rates on
$300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2008. The forward starting swaps were appropriately designated and tested for effectiveness as cash flow hedges. In March 2008, we settled the forward starting swaps and made a cash payment of $14.6
million to the counterparties. An effectiveness test was performed as of the settlement date and it was concluded that a highly effective cash flow hedge was still in place for the expected debt offering. Of the amount paid in settlement,
approximately $700,000 was immediately reclassified to interest expense, as the result of partial ineffectiveness calculated at the settlement date. The net amount of $13.9 million was recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) and is
being recognized through interest expense over the life of the hedged debt offering, which took place in May 2008. The remaining unamortized amount included as a reduction to accumulated OCI as of December 31, 2008 is $12.0 million.

In August 2005, we entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward starting interest
rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2007. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any changes in fair value recorded in OCI. In conjunction with the September 2007 issuance of $300.0 million
of senior unsecured notes, we terminated these cash flow hedges as designated. The settlement amount received of $10.7 million is being recognized to earnings through a reduction of interest expense over the term of the hedged cash flows. The
remaining unamortized amount included as an increase to accumulated OCI as of December 31, 2008 is $9.3 million. The ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant.

In March 2005, we entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million
of anticipated debt offerings in 2006. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any changes in fair value recorded in OCI. In March 2006, we issued $150.0 million of 5.50% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and terminated a corresponding amount
of the cash flow hedges designated for this transaction. The settlement amount paid of approximately $800,000 is being recognized to earnings through interest expense ratably over the life of the senior unsecured notes and the ineffective portion of
the hedge was insignificant. In August 2006, we issued $450.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $250.0 million of 5.63% senior unsecured notes due 2011 and terminated the remaining $150.0 million of cash flow hedges. The
settlement amount received of approximately $1.6 million is being recognized to earnings through a reduction of interest expense ratably over the lives of the senior unsecured notes. The ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant. The net
remaining unamortized amount included as an increase to accumulated OCI related to these two swaps that were unwound in 2006 is approximately $599,000 as of December 31, 2008.

The effectiveness of our hedges is evaluated throughout their lives using the hypothetical derivative method under which the change in fair value of the
actual swap designated as the hedging instrument is compared to the change in fair value of a hypothetical swap. We had no material interest rate derivatives, when considering both fair value and notional amount, at December 31, 2008.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS
No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”) was effective for us on January 1, 2008. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157
applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements; accordingly, the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances. Based on the guidance
provided by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Position No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

(“FSP 157-2”), we have only partially implemented the guidance promulgated under SFAS
157 as of January 1, 2008, which in our circumstances only affects financial instruments. SFAS 157 was not applied during 2008 to nonfinancial long-lived asset groups measured for an impairment assessment, reporting units measured at fair value
in the first step of the goodwill impairment test, and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination. We will fully apply the provisions of SFAS 157 beginning January 1, 2009 and do
not expect there to be a material impact to the financial statements.

SFAS 157 emphasized that fair value is a market-based measurement,
not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in
fair value measurements, SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified
within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

- 81 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities to which we have access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from
different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our
assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”) and SFAS No.160,

Noncontrolling Interests
in the Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment to ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 require most identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business
combination to be recorded at “full fair value” and require noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity, which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling
interest holders. Both Statements are effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and earlier adoption is prohibited. SFAS 141R will be applied to business combinations after the effective date. SFAS 160 will be applied
prospectively to all noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 on our results of operations and financial position.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133

(“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities, specifically in regard to the purpose of the derivative and how the derivative and hedging activities affect
an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008 and early application is allowed. We will apply SFAS 161 beginning in 2009.

In May 2008, the FASB ratified FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in
Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)

(“FSP APB 14-1”) that will require separate accounting for the debt and equity components of convertible instruments. FSP APB 14-1 will require that the value assigned to the
debt component would be the estimated fair value of a similar bond without the conversion feature, which would result in the debt being recorded at a discount. The resulting debt discount will be amortized over the period during which the debt is
expected to be outstanding (i.e., through the first optional redemption date) as additional non-cash interest expense. FSP APB 14-1 is effective January 1, 2009 and will be applied retrospectively. We currently estimate that FSP APB 14-1 will
result in us recognizing additional non-cash interest expense of between $5.5 million and $7.5 million per annum.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have
guaranteed the repayment of $68.1 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental
taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of nine of our unconsolidated
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2008, the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately $255.1 million. Additionally, we guaranteed $29.0 million of secured indebtedness related to a property sold to a third party in 2006.
Management believes that the value of the underlying real estate exceeds the associated loan balances and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees.

We have entered into agreements, subject to the completion of due diligence requirements, resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions, for the future acquisitions of land
totaling $8.0 million. In most cases, we may withdraw from land purchase contracts and the seller’s only recourse is earnest money deposits that we have already paid.

In October 2000, we sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair value of $487.0 million to a joint venture (Dugan Realty
LLC) in which we have a 50% interest and recognized a net gain of $35.2 million. In connection with this transaction, the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to a $50.0 million interest in the joint venture to us in exchange for
our common stock or cash (at our option), subject to certain timing and other restrictions. As a result of this put option, we deferred $10.2 million of gain on sale of depreciated property and recorded a $50.0 million liability.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any
ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
