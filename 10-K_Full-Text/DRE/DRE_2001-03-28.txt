PART I

Item 1.  Business

Duke-Weeks Realty Corporation (the “Company”) is a
self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”). The
Company began operations upon completion of its initial public offering in
February 1986. In October 1993, the Company completed an additional common
stock offering and acquired the rental real estate and service businesses of
Duke Associates, whose operations began in 1972. As of December 31, 2000, the
Company’s diversified portfolio of 958 rental properties (including 45
properties totaling 8.1 million square feet under development) encompass 109.0
million rentable square feet and are leased by a diverse and stable base of
over 4,500 tenants whose businesses include manufacturing, retailing, wholesale
trade, distribution and professional services. The Company also owns more than
4,100 acres of unencumbered land ready for development.

The Company, through its Service Operations, also
provides, on a fee basis, leasing, property and asset management, development,
construction, landscaping, build-to-suit, and other tenant-related services for
approximately 500 tenants in over 6.3 million square feet of space at
properties owned by third-party clients. With 13 primary operating platforms,
the Company concentrates its activities in the Midwest and Southeast United
States. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” for financial information. The Company’s rental operations
are conducted through Duke-Weeks Realty Limited Partnership (“DWRLP”). In
addition, the Company conducts its service operations through Duke Realty
Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited Partnership, in
which the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Duke Services, Inc., is the sole
general partner. All references to the "Company" in this Form 10-K
Report include the Company and those entities owned or controlled by the
Company, unless the context indicates otherwise.

The Company’s headquarters and executive offices are
located in Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition, the Company has thirteen
regional offices located in Atlanta, Georgia; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio;
Cleveland, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North
Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri and Tampa, Florida. The Company had 1,411
employees as of December 31, 2000.

Business Strategy

The Company’s business objective is to increase its
Funds From Operations (“FFO”) by (i) maintaining and increasing property
occupancy and rental rates through the aggressive management of its portfolio
of existing properties; (ii) expanding existing properties; (iii) developing
and acquiring new properties; and (iv) providing a full line of real estate
services to the Company’s tenants and to third-parties. FFO is defined by the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as net income or loss,
excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciated
property, plus operating property depreciation and amortization and adjustments
for minority interest and unconsolidated companies on the same basis. While
management believes that FFO is a relevant measure of the Company’s operating
performance because it is widely used by industry analysts to measure the
operating performance of equity REITs, such amount does not represent cash flow
from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles, should
not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the
Company’s operating performance, and is not indicative of cash available to
fund all cash flow needs. As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm,
the Company believes that its in-house leasing, management, development and
construction services and the Company’s significant base of commercially zoned
and unencumbered land in existing business parks should give the Company a
competitive advantage in its future development activities.

The Company believes that the analysis of real estate
opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or local
levels. As a result, the Company intends to continue its emphasis on increasing
its market share and effective rents in its primary markets where it owns
properties. The Company also expects to utilize its more than 4,100 acres of
unencumbered land and its many business relationships with nearly 5,000
commercial tenants to expand its build-to-suit business (development projects
substantially pre-leased to a single tenant) and to pursue other development
and acquisition opportunities in its primary markets. The Company believes that
this regional focus will allow it to assess market supply and demand for real
estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on its strong relationships
with its tenant base.

The Company’s policy is to seek to develop and acquire
Class A commercial properties located in markets with high growth potential for
Fortune 500 companies and other quality regional and local firms. The Company’s
industrial and suburban office development focuses on business parks and
mixed-use developments  suitable for
development of multiple projects on a single site where the Company can create and
control the business environment. These business parks and mixed-use
developments generally include restaurants and other amenities which the
Company believes will create an atmosphere that is particularly efficient and
desirable. The Company’s retail development focuses on community, power and
neighborhood centers in its existing markets. As a fully integrated real estate
company, the Company is able to arrange for or provide to its industrial,
office and retail tenants not only well located and well maintained facilities,
but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish
construction, expansion flexibility and advertising and marketing services.

All of the Company’s properties are located in areas
that include competitive properties. Such properties are generally owned by
institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators; however,
no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in the Company’s
current markets. The supply and demand of similar available rental properties
may affect the rental rates the Company will receive on its properties. Based
upon the current occupancy rates in Company and competitive properties, the
Company believes there will not be significant competitive pressure to lower
rental rates in the near future.

Financing Strategy

The Company seeks to maintain a well-balanced,
conservative and flexible capital structure by: (i) currently targeting a ratio
of long-term debt to total market capitalization in the range of 25% to 40%;
(ii) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of its debt; (iii) borrowing
primarily at fixed rates; (iv) generally pursuing current and future long-term
debt financings and refinancings on an unsecured basis; and (v) maintaining
conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios. Management believes
that these strategies have enabled and should continue to enable the Company to
access the debt and equity capital markets for their long-term requirements
such as debt refinancings and financing development and acquisitions of additional
rental properties. In addition, as discussed under Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the
Company has $750 million in unsecured lines of credit and a $150 million
secured line of credit available for short-term fundings of development and
acquisition of additional rental properties. In addition to debt and equity
capital markets, the Company has developed a strategy to pursue favorable
opportunities to dispose of assets that no longer meet the Company’s long-term
investment criteria and re-deploy the proceeds into new investments with
excellent long-term growth prospects. See additional discussion under Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” The Company’s debt to total market capitalization ratio (total
market capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding
Common and Preferred Shares and units of limited partnership interest (“Units”)
in DWRLP plus outstanding indebtedness) at December 31, 2000 was 31.4%. The
Company’s ratio of earnings to debt service and ratio of earnings to fixed
charges for the year ended December 31, 2000 were 2.32x and 1.71x,
respectively. In computing the ratio of earnings to debt service, earnings have
been calculated by adding debt service to income before gains or losses on
property sales and minority interest in earnings of DWRLP. Debt service
consists of interest expense and recurring principal amortization (excluding
maturities) and excludes amortization of debt issuance costs. In computing the
ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings have been calculated by adding
fixed charges, excluding capitalized interest, to income before gains or losses
on property sales and minority interest in earnings of DWRLP. Fixed charges
consist of interest costs, whether expensed or capitalized, the interest
component of rental expense, amortization of debt issuance costs and preferred
stock dividend requirements. Management believes these measures to be
consistent with its financing strategy.

Merger With Weeks Corporation

In July 1999, Weeks Corporation
(“Weeks”), a self-administered, self-managed geographically focused Real Estate
Investment Trust (“REIT”) which operated primarily in the southeastern United
States, was merged with and into Duke Realty Investments, Inc. (“Duke”). The
combined company has continued under the name Duke-Weeks Realty Corporation
(“the Company”). The total purchase price of Weeks aggregated approximately
$1.9 billion, which included the assumption of the outstanding debt and
liabilities of Weeks of approximately $775 million. The transaction was
structured as a tax-free merger and was accounted for under the purchase
method.

The following summarized pro forma
unaudited information represents the combined historical operating results of
Weeks and Duke with the appropriate purchase accounting adjustments, assuming
the merger had occurred on January 1, 1998. The pro forma financial information
presented is not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s actual operating
results would have been had Weeks and Duke constituted a single entity during
such periods (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Other

The Company’s operations are not dependent on a single
or few customers as no single customer accounts for more than 1.7% of the
Company’s total revenue. The Company’s operations are not subject to any
significant seasonal fluctuations. The Company believes it is in compliance
with environmental regulations and does not anticipate material effects of
continued compliance.

Item 7.  Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations

Overview

The Company’s income from rental operations is
substantially influenced by the supply and demand for the Company’s rental
space in its primary markets, its ability to maintain occupancy rates and
increase rental rates on its in-service portfolio and to continue development
and acquisition of additional rental properties.

The Company’s primary markets have continued to offer
strong and stable local economies and have provided attractive new development
opportunities because of their central location, established manufacturing
base, skilled work force and moderate labor costs. The Company’s occupancy rate
of its in-service portfolio was 93.6% at December 31, 2000. The Company expects
to continue to maintain its overall occupancy levels and also expects to be
able to increase rental rates as leases are renewed or new leases are executed.
This combination should improve the Company’s results of operations from its
in-service properties. The Company’s strategy for continued growth includes
developing and acquiring additional rental properties in its primary markets.

The Company tracks same property performance which
compares those properties that were in-service for all of a two-year period. In
2000, net operating income from the same property portfolio increased 4.2% over
1999, compared to 3.2% growth in 1999 over 1998.

The following table sets forth information regarding the
Company’s in-service portfolio of rental properties as of December 31, 2000
(square feet in thousands):

The following
table reflects the Company’s in-service lease expiration schedule as of
December 31, 2000, by product type indicating square footage and annualized net
effective rents under expiring leases (in thousands, except per square foot
amounts):

The Company also expects to realize
growth in earnings from rental operations through the development and
acquisition of additional rental properties in its primary markets and the
completion of the 8.1 million square feet of properties under development by
the Company at December 31, 2000, over the next three quarters and thereafter.
These properties under development should provide future earnings through
Service Operations income upon sale or from rental operations growth as they
are placed in service as follows (in thousands, except percent leased and
stabilized returns):

Merger With Weeks Corporation

In July 1999, Weeks Corporation
(“Weeks”), a self-administered, self-managed geographically focused Real Estate
Investment Trust (“REIT”) which operated primarily in the southeastern United
States, was merged with and into Duke Realty Investments, Inc. (“Duke”). The
combined company has continued under the name Duke-Weeks Realty Corporation
(“the Company”). The total purchase price of Weeks aggregated approximately
$1.9 billion, which included the assumption of the outstanding debt and
liabilities of Weeks of approximately $775 million. The transaction was
structured as a tax-free merger and was accounted for under the purchase
method.

The following summarized pro forma
unaudited information represents the combined historical operating results of
Weeks and Duke with the appropriate purchase accounting adjustments, assuming
the merger had occurred on January 1, 1998. The pro forma financial information
presented is not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s actual operating
results would have been had Weeks and Duke constituted a single entity during
such periods (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Results
of Operations

A summary of the Company’s
operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2000, is as follows (in thousands, except
number of properties and per share amounts):

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2000 to Year Ended
December 31, 1999

Rental Operations

Rental Operations revenue increased to
$711.8 million from $535.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000,
compared to the same period in 1999. 
This increase is primarily due to the increase in the number of
in-service properties during the respective periods.  As of December 31, 2000, the Company had 913 properties in
service compared to 865 properties at December 31, 1999.  The following is a summary of the Company's
acquisition and development activity since January 1, 1999:

Rental
property, real estate tax and depreciation and amortization expenses increased
for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to the same period in 1999, due
to the increase in the number of in-service properties during the respective
periods.

The
$47.2 million increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to higher
outstanding debt balances associated with the financing of the Company's
investment activities. The increased balances include $450 million of unsecured
debt issued in 1999, the assumption of $185 million of secured debt and $287
million of unsecured debt in the merger with Weeks Corporation in July 1999,
and increased borrowings on the Company's lines of credit.  These higher borrowing costs were partially
offset by the capitalization of interest on increased property development
activities.

As
a result of the above-mentioned items, earnings from Rental Operations
increased $31.5 million from $197.5 million for the year ended December 31,
1999, to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

Service
Operations

Service
Operations revenues increased by $28.8 million from $54.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999, to $82.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000,
primarily as a result of increases in construction and development income from
increased third-party construction and revenues from the development and sale
profits of build-to-suit properties.

Service
Operations operating expenses increased from $36.2 million in 1999 to $50.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2000, due to the overall growth of the
Company and the increased portfolio of buildings associated with this growth,
and the significant increase in construction and development activity in 2000.

As
a result, earnings from Service Operations increased from $17.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999, to $32.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2000.

General
and Administrative Expense

General
and Administrative Expense increased from $16.6 million in 1999 to $21.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2000, due to an increase in corporate
expenses associated with overall growth of the Company and effects of a full
year's operations resulting from the merger with Weeks Corporation in July
1999.

Other
Income and Expenses

Interest
income increased from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, to
$6.9 million for the same period in 2000 primarily through earnings on funds
deposited in tax deferred exchange escrows of $3.6 million.

The
Company has a disposition strategy to pursue favorable opportunities to dispose
of real estate assets that no longer meet long-term investment objectives of
the Company, which resulted in net sales proceeds of $413.8 million and a net
gain of $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

In
conjunction with this disposition strategy, included in net real estate
investments are 28 buildings with a net book value of $112.0 million which were
classified as held for sale by the Company at December 31, 2000. The Company
expects to complete these and other dispositions and use the proceeds to fund
future investments in real estate assets.

Net Income Available for Common Shareholders

Net income available for common shareholders for the
year ended December 31, 2000 was $213.0 million compared to $139.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase results primarily from the
operating result fluctuations in rental and service operations and earnings
from sales of real estate assets explained above.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 1999 to Year Ended
December 31, 1998

Rental Operations

The Company increased its in-service portfolio of rental
properties from 453 properties comprising 52.0 million square feet at December
31, 1998 to 865 properties comprising 92.5 million square feet at December 31,
1999 through the acquisition of 365 properties totaling 31.4 million square
feet and the placement in service of 68 properties and four building expansions
totaling 10.9 million square feet. Of these additional acquisition properties,
335 properties totaling 28.6 million square feet relate to the Weeks Merger.

The Company also disposed of 21 properties totaling 1.9
million square feet. These 412 net additional rental properties primarily
account for the $186.9 million increase in revenues from Rental Operations from
1998 to 1999. The increase from 1998 to 1999 in rental expenses, real estate
taxes and depreciation and amortization expense is also a result of the additional
412 in-service rental properties.

The $26.5 million increase in interest expense is
primarily attributed to higher outstanding debt balances associated with the
financing of the Company’s investment activities. The increased balances
include $450 million of unsecured debt issued in 1999, the assumption of $185
million of secured debt and $287 million of unsecured debt in the Weeks Merger,
and increased borrowings on the Company’s unsecured lines of credit. These
higher borrowing costs were partially offset by the capitalization of interest
on increased property development activities which increased in 1999 compared
to 1998.

As a result of the above-mentioned items, earnings from
Rental Operations increased $71.5 million from $126.0 million for 1998 to $197.5
million for 1999.

Service Operations

Service Operations revenues increased from $24.7 million
to $54.0 million for the year ended 1999 as compared to 1998 primarily as a
result of increases in construction management fee revenue because of an
increase in third-party construction volume. Service Operations expenses
increased from $17.5 million to $36.1 million for the year ended 1999, as
compared to 1998, as a result of (i) payroll increasing from $12.5 million in
1998 to $17.2 million in 1999 due to the Weeks Merger and additional personnel
added to existing regional offices due to the overall growth of the Company;
(ii) income tax expenses increasing by $5.2 million as a result of increased
activity in properties constructed for sale; and (iii) maintenance expenses
increasing from $2.5 million in 1998 to $9.7 million in 1999 through the
addition of substantial landscape operations in the Weeks Merger and the growth
of the Company in Midwest markets.

As a result of the above-mentioned items, earnings from
Service Operations increased $10.7 million from $7.2 million in 1998 to $17.9
million for the year ended 1999.

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased from $11.6
million for the year ended 1998 to $16.6 million for 1999 primarily due to an
overall increase in corporate expenses associated with the Weeks Merger and the
overall growth of the Company.

Other Income and
Expenses

During 1999, the Company developed a disposition
strategy to pursue favorable opportunities to dispose of real estate assets
that no longer meet long-term investment objectives of the Company, which
resulted in net sales proceeds of $76.4 million and a net gain of $10.0 million
in 1999.

Net Income Available for Common Shareholders

Net income available for common shareholders for the
year ended December 31, 1999, was $139.6 million compared to $90.9 million for
1998.  This increase results primarily
from the increases in the operating results of rental and service operations
explained above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Financial Flexibility

During 1999 and continuing into 2000, the real estate
industry experienced a reduced supply of favorably priced equity and debt
capital, which generally decreased the level of new investment activity by real
estate companies. While the Company has been subject to the same capital market
conditions as other real estate companies, management believes the Company’s
financial and liquidity position are relatively strong. Over the years, the
Company has carefully managed its balance sheet in an effort to avoid liquidity
issues in any given quarter or year. In management’s view, this should provide
a competitive advantage in the current capital constrained market over many of
its competitors. Following are three key indicators that demonstrate the
overall strength of the Company’s financial position. First, the Company
believes that its strong balance sheet and expected real estate asset
disposition proceeds will provide the Company with sufficient capital to fund its
investment activities. Second, the Company has maintained a conservative
balance sheet with a debt-to-market capitalization of 31.4% at December 31,
2000. Third, as of December 31, 2000, the Company has a total of $627.3 million
of undrawn capacity on its existing lines of credit to meet its short-term
obligations.

Management believes that these key factors will provide
the Company with substantial financial flexibility to capitalize on investment
opportunities which may not be available to other real estate companies with
more limited financial resources.

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased
by $133.5 million in 2000 as compared to 1999 and by $94.4 million in 1999 as
compared to 1998. These increases are due primarily to the Weeks Merger in July
1999, the development and acquisition of additional rental properties, and cash
flow from existing real estate assets.

Investing and Financing
Activities

During 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company invested net
cash of $97.8 million, $740.3 million, and $703.8 million, respectively, into
real estate investing activities. In 2000, the Company used the proceeds
received from the disposal of real estate assets identified as result of its
capital disposition strategy to fund its future development.  During 2000, the Company received
approximately $413.8 million of proceeds from land and depreciated property
sales and a $158.4 million capital distribution from an unconsolidated company
which were used to fund development activities and reduce amounts outstanding
on the Company's line of credit.

The $740.3 million invested in real estate in 1999 was
financed primarily from the borrowings under the Company’s unsecured lines of
credit. These unsecured lines of credit were partially repaid with proceeds
from the issuance of $450.0 million of long-term unsecured debt, $214.8 million
in net proceeds from the sale of common shares, and $96.5 million of net
proceeds from the sale of preferred shares. The $703.8 million invested in real
estate during 1998 was financed primarily from borrowings under the Company’s
line of credit. These borrowings were partially repaid with proceeds from the
issuance of $250.0 million of long-term unsecured debt, $211.5 million in net
proceeds from the sale of common shares, and $129.5 million of net proceeds
from the sale of preferred shares.

Other significant financing activity included the
payment of $256.9 million, $196.7 million, and $123.1 million in common and
preferred share distributions in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
increases are primarily attributable to (i) an increase in the overall number
of common shares and Series F Preferred Shares outstanding resulting from the
Weeks Merger in 1999; and (ii) annual increases in the cash distributions paid
per common share.

The
Company currently has on file a Form S-3 Registration Statement (the “Shelf
Registration”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission which has remaining
availability as of December 31, 2000, of $792.9 million to issue additional common
stock, preferred stock and unsecured debt securities. The Company intends to
issue additional securities under this Shelf Registration to fund the
development and acquisition of additional rental properties. The Company also
has a Shelf Registration on file for at-the-market offerings of 1.5 million
shares of common stock.  The Company
completed a $75.0 million preferred stock offering in February 2001.

The
recurring capital needs of the Company are funded primarily through the
undistributed net cash provided by operating activities. A summary of the
Company’s recurring capital expenditures is as follows (in thousands):

The
Company has the following lines of credit available (in thousands):

The lines of credit are used to fund
development and acquisition of additional rental properties and to provide
working capital.

The $450 million line of credit allows
the Company an option to obtain borrowings from the financial institutions that
participate in the line of credit at rates lower than the stated interest rate,
subject to certain restrictions. Amounts outstanding on the line of credit at
December 31, 2000 are at LIBOR + .55% to .70%. In February 2001, the Company
renewed the $450 million line of credit. The borrowing capacity was increased
to $500 million, the interest rate was lowered to LIBOR + .65% and the maturity
date was extended to March 1, 2004.

The debt outstanding at December 31, 2000
totals $2.0 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 7.32% maturing at
various dates through 2028. The Company has $1.5 billion of unsecured debt and
$466.6 million of secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2000. Scheduled
principal amortization of such debt totaled $10.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000.

Following is a summary of the scheduled
future amortization and maturities of the Company’s indebtedness at December
31, 2000 (in thousands):

Shareholder Dividend/Distribution Requirements

The
Company intends to pay regular quarterly dividends from net cash provided by
operating activities. A quarterly dividend of $.43 per common share was
declared on January 31, 2001, which represents an annualized dividend of $1.72
per share.

Funds From Operations

Management believes that Funds From Operations (“FFO”),
which is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
as net income or loss, excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and
sales of depreciated property, plus operating property depreciation and
amortization and adjustments for minority interest and unconsolidated companies
on the same basis, is the industry standard for reporting the operations of
real estate investment trusts.

The following reflects the calculation of the Company’s
FFO for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

The increase in FFO during the three-year period results
primarily from the increased in-service rental property portfolio as discussed
above under “Results of Operations.”

While management believes that FFO is the most relevant
and widely used measure of the Company’s operating performance, such amount
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted
accounting principles, should not be considered as an alternative to net income
as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, and is not indicative
of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.

Accounting
Changes

In
June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging Activities,"
as amended by Statement No. 138, effective for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2000. These statements will require the Company to recognize all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges
must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge,
then depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value will
either be offset through earnings, against the change in fair value of hedged
assets, liabilities or firm commitments or recognized in other comprehensive
income until the hedged item is recognized in income. The ineffective portion
of a hedge's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in income. The
adoption of these statements will not have a material impact on the Company's
financial statements.

Item
7a.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure About Market Risks

The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily
as a result of its line of credit and long-term debt used to maintain liquidity
and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company’s real estate
investment portfolio and operations. The Company’s interest rate risk
management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on
earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve
its objectives the Company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into
derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury
locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial
instrument. The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate
transactions for speculative purposes.

The Company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a
variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts (in
thousands) of the expected annual maturities, weighted average interest rates
for the average debt outstanding in the specified period, fair values and other
terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest
rate changes. The fair values of the Company’s debt instruments are calculated
as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate
commensurate with the risks involved.

The Company has four interest rate swap agreements
outstanding which have an aggregate fair market value of $397,761 at December
31, 2000. Three of the swap agreements mature on December 31, 2001, in
conjunction with the maturity of an $85 million unsecured syndicated bank term
loan. The fourth swap agreement is in conjunction with a $40 million mortgage
loan which matures January 2003, along with the swap agreement.

As the table incorporates only those exposures that
exist as of December 31, 2000, it does not consider those exposures or
positions which could arise after that date. As a result, the Company’s
ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will
depend on the exposures that arise during the period, the Company’s hedging
strategies at that time, and interest rates.

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Duke-Weeks Realty
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)

The
Company

The
Company’s rental operations are conducted through Duke-Weeks Realty Limited
Partnership (“DWRLP”), of which the Company owns 86.9% at December 31, 2000.
The remaining interests in DWRLP are exchangeable for shares of the Company's
common stock on a one-for-one basis. The Company conducts service operations
through Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited
Partnership, in which the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Duke Services,
Inc., is the sole general partner. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned or controlled
subsidiaries. The equity interests in these majority-owned or controlled
subsidiaries not owned by the Company are reflected as minority interests in
the consolidated financial statements.

(2)

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Principles
of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. The
equity interests in these majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries not owned
by the Company are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated
financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain 1998 and 1999 balances have been reclassified to
conform to 2000 presentation.

Real
Estate Investments

Real estate investments to be held and used are stated
at the lower of cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value if impairment
is identified. Real estate investments to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Buildings and
land improvements are depreciated on the straight-line method over their
estimated life not to exceed 40 and 15 years, respectively, and tenant
improvement costs are depreciated on the straight-line method over the term of
the related lease.

All direct and indirect costs, including interest and
real estate taxes clearly associated with the development, construction or
expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the
property.  All external costs associated
with the acquisition of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of
the property.

The Company evaluates its real estate investments to be
held and used upon occurrence of significant changes in the operations, but not
less than annually, to assess whether any impairment indications are present,
including recurring operating losses and significant adverse changes in legal
factors or business climate that affect the recovery of the recorded value. If
any real estate investment is considered impaired, a loss is provided to reduce
the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value.

The acquisitions of minority interests for the Company’s
common shares are recorded under the purchase method with assets acquired
reflected at the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
acquisition, net of the retirement of any minority interest liabilities. The
acquisition amounts are allocated to rental property based on their estimated
fair values.

The Company has equity interests in unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures which own and operate rental properties and
hold land for development. The equity method of accounting is used for these
investments in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant
influence over operating and financial policies. Any difference between the
carrying amount of these investments and the underlying equity in net assets is
amortized to equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies over the
depreciable life of the property, generally 40 years.

Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased are classified as cash equivalents.

Deferred
Costs

Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing
are amortized to interest expense on the straight-line method over the term of
the related loan. All direct and indirect costs associated with the rental of
real estate investments owned by the Company are amortized over the term of the
related lease. Unamortized costs are charged to expense upon the early
termination of the lease or upon early payment of the financing.

Revenues

Rental Operations

Rental income from leases with scheduled rental
increases during their terms is recognized on a straightline basis.

Service Operations

Management fees are based on a percentage of rental
receipts of properties managed and are recognized as the rental receipts are
collected. Maintenance fees are based upon established hourly rates and are
recognized as the services are performed. Construction management and
development fees for third party contracts are generally based on a percentage
of costs and are recognized based upon percentage of completion.

Duke
Construction Limited Partnership (“DCLP”) provides traditional construction
services to third parties and develops and constructs properties intended for
resale with profits recognized as additional service operation income at time
of sale. Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership (“DRSLP”) is the sole general
partner of DCLP and the operations of DCLP are included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. The sole limited partner of DCLP is Duke Realty
Construction, Inc. (“DRCI”), of which DWRLP owns 100% of the preferred stock
and realizes substantially all economic benefits of its activities.

DRCI
is not a qualified Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") subsidiary
of the Company. Accordingly, provisions for federal income taxes are recognized
as appropriate.

Net Income Per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by
dividing net income available for common shares by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is
computed by dividing the sum of net income available for common shares and
minority interest in earnings of unitholders, by the sum of the weighted
average number of common shares and units outstanding and dilutive potential
common shares for the period.

The following table reconciles the components of basic
and diluted net income per share:

All convertible preferred stock, convertible preferred
limited partner units and put options (see Footnote 5)  were anti-dilutive in 2000 and 1999;
therefore, no conversion to common shares is assumed in weighted dilutive
potential common shares at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Federal
Income Taxes

As a REIT, the Company is allowed to reduce taxable
income by all or a portion of its distributions to shareholders. As deductible
distributions have exceeded taxable income, no provision for federal income
taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of
dividends to shareholders, differ from reported net income primarily because of
different depreciable lives and bases of rental properties and differences in
the timing of recognition of earnings upon disposition of properties.

A summary of the taxable nature of the Company’s
dividends for the three years ended December 31 is as follows:

Dividends per share of $1.26, $1.23 and $1.09 were required for the Company to
maintain its REIT status in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Federal income tax expense of $8.0 million, $5.4 million
and $170,000 was recorded in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, related to
DRCI. There were no significant deferred income tax items.

Fair
Value Of Financial Instruments

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are
generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using
a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved and approximate their
carrying or contract values.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

The Company may enter into derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks in order to mitigate
its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. These derivative
financial instruments are designated as hedges and deferral accounting is
applied as the derivative financial instrument reduces exposure to interest
rate risk. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are amortized
to interest expense over the term of the hedged instrument.  Amounts paid or received on interest rate
swaps are included in interest expense.

Use Of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(3)

Merger With Weeks Corporation

In
July 1999, Weeks Corporation (“Weeks”), a self-administered, self-managed
geographically focused Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) which operated
primarily in the southeastern United States, was merged with and into Duke
Realty Investments, Inc. (“Duke”). The combined company has continued under the
name Duke-Weeks Realty Corporation (“the Company”). The total purchase price of
Weeks aggregated approximately $1.9 billion, which included the assumption of
the outstanding debt and liabilities of Weeks of approximately $775 million.
The transaction was structured as a tax-free merger and was accounted for under
the purchase method.

The
following summarized pro forma unaudited information represents the combined
historical operating results of Weeks and Duke with the appropriate purchase
accounting adjustments, assuming the merger had occurred on January 1, 1998.
The pro forma financial information presented is not necessarily indicative of
what the Company’s actual operating results would have been had Weeks and Duke
constituted a single entity during such periods (in thousands, except per share
amounts):

(4)

Related Party Transactions

The Company provides management, leasing, construction
and other tenant related services to partnerships in which certain executive
officers have continuing ownership interests. The Company was paid fees
totaling $1.9 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million for such services in 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively. Management believes the terms for such services
are equivalent to those available in the market. The Company has an option to
purchase the executive officers’ interest in each of these properties which
expires October 2003. The option price of each property was established at the
date the options were granted.

At December 31, 2000, other assets included outstanding
loan advances totaling $2.4 million due from a related party, under a $5.7 million
demand loan agreement. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.10% and is
secured by real estate assets held by the related entity, for which the Company
has arrangements to acquire in future periods. Interest earned under the
agreement and included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations totaled $226,853 in the year ended December 31, 2000.

(5)

Investments in Unconsolidated Companies

In October 2000, the Company sold or contributed $469
million of industrial properties and $18 million of undeveloped land to a joint
venture (Dugan Realty LLC) in which the Company has a 50% interest. This
transaction expands an existing joint venture with an institutional real estate
investor. Upon completion of the transaction, the joint venture owns 129
buildings totaling more than 21 million square feet with a value of
approximately $800 million at December 31, 2000. The venture properties are
secured by $383 million of first mortgage debt. The Company received $363.9
million of proceeds and recorded a net gain of $35.2 million as a result of the
transaction. In connection with this transaction, the joint venture partners
were given an option to put up to $50 million interest in the joint venture to
the Company in exchange for common stock of the Company or cash, subject to
timing and other restrictions. As a result of this put option, the Company
deferred $10.2 million of gain on sale of property to the joint venture and
recorded a $50 million liability. The Company provides real estate related services
to the venture through its Service Operations.

In December 2000, the Company contributed 14 industrial
properties, including five under development, totaling approximately three
million square feet to a joint venture (Dugan Texas LLC) in which the Company
has a 50% interest. The Company also contributed 145 acres of undeveloped land.
Following the Company's contribution and that of the other joint venture
partner, the joint venture owns 29 buildings totaling 4.6 million square feet
and approximately 165 acres of undeveloped land. The Company received $33.1
million of proceeds and recorded a net gain of $686,000 as a result of the
transaction. The Company provides real estate related services to the venture
through its Service Operations.

Combined summarized financial information of the
companies which are accounted for by the equity method as of December 31, 2000
and 1999, and for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, are as
follows (in thousands):

(6)

Real Estate Held for Sale

The Company has a capital recycling program through
which it is continually pursuing favorable opportunities to dispose of real
estate assets that no longer meet long-term investment objectives of the
Company in order to redeploy capital. At December 31, 2000, the Company had 15
office, 12 industrial and one retail property comprising approximately 3.3
million square feet held for sale. Of these properties, four build-to-suit
office, seven build-to-suit industrial and one build-to-suit retail property
were under development at December 31, 2000. Net operating income (defined as
total property revenues, less property expenses, which include real estate
taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management, utilities, insurance and
other expenses) of the properties held for sale for the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 is approximately $5.8 million, $5.5 million, and $5.3
million, respectively. Net book value of the properties held for sale at
December 31, 2000 is approximately $112.0 million. There can be no assurance
that such properties held for sale will be sold.

(7)

Indebtedness

Indebtedness at December 31 consists of the
following (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2000,
the $466.6 million of secured debt is collateralized by rental properties with
a net carrying value of $782.0 million.

The Company has the following lines of credit available (in thousands):

The
lines of credit are used to fund development and acquisition of additional
rental properties and to provide working capital.

The
$450 million line of credit allows the Company an option to obtain borrowings
from the financial institutions that participate in the line of credit at rates
lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions. Amounts
outstanding on the line of credit at December 31, 2000 are at LIBOR +.55%
to.70%.

In July 1999 in conjunction with the Weeks Merger, the
Company assumed an $85 million unsecured syndicated bank term loan (the “Term
Loan”). Interest accrues on the Term Loan at LIBOR + 1.10% and the Term Loan
matures on December 31, 2001. The Company also assumed three interest rate swap
agreements with three commercial banks that effectively changes the interest
costs on the entire $85 million Term Loan from its variable rate to a fixed
rate. The interest rate swap agreements, with notational principal amounts of
$35 million, $25 million and $25 million, mature on December 31, 2001, and
effectively convert interest costs on the Term Loan to a fixed rate of
approximately 6.1% through maturity. The estimated fair market value of the
swap agreements was $780,904 at December 31, 2000.

The Company has an interest rate swap agreement (the
"Agreement") on $40.0 million of the Company's outstanding mortgage
debt to effectively fix the interest rate. Under the Agreement, the Company
pays or receives the difference between a fixed rate of 5.99% and a floating
rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 1.75% based on the notational principal amount of
$40.0 million. The amount paid or received under the Agreement is included in
interest expense on a monthly basis. The Agreement matures along with the
related mortgage loan in January 2003. The Agreement will stay in place until
maturity unless the 30-day LIBOR rate on the date of monthly repricing exceeds
6.51% which will cause a termination of the Agreement until such time the
monthly repricing is lower than 6.51%. The 30-day LIBOR rate at December 31,
2000, was 6.56%. The estimated fair value of the Agreement at December 31,
2000, was ($383,143). The Company also has an interest rate cap on the same $40
million of mortgage debt which limits the Company's floating interest rate
expense to no more than 10.16% for the term of the loan.

At December 31, 2000, scheduled amortization and
maturities of all indebtedness for the next five years and thereafter are as
follows  (in thousands):

Cash paid for interest in 2000, 1999, and 1998 was
$156.5 million, $100.3 million and $63.6 million, respectively. Total interest
capitalized in 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $33.0 million, $26.0 million and $8.5
million, respectively.

(8)

Segment Reporting

The Company is engaged in four operating segments, the
ownership and rental of office, industrial, and retail real estate investments
and the providing of various real estate services such as property management,
maintenance, landscaping, leasing, and construction management to third-party
property owners (“Service Operations). The Company’s reportable segments offer
different products or services and are managed separately because each requires
different operating strategies and management expertise. There are no material
intersegment sales or transfers.

Non-segment revenue to reconcile to total revenue
consists mainly of equity in earnings of joint ventures. Non-segment assets to
reconcile to total assets consists of corporate assets including cash, deferred
financing costs and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as
those described in Note 2.

The Company assesses and measures segment operating
results based on a performance measure referred to as Funds From Operations
(“FFO”). The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts defines FFO
as net income or loss, excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings and
sales of depreciated property, plus operating property depreciation and
amortization and adjustments for minority interest and unconsolidated companies
on the same basis. FFO is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from
operating activities as measured by generally accepted accounting principles,
is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should
not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Interest
expense and other non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated
to individual segments in determining the Company’s performance measure.

The revenues and FFO for each of the reportable segments
are summarized as follows for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and
1998, and the assets of each reportable segment as of December 31, 2000 and
1999 (in thousands):

(9)

Leasing
Activity

Future minimum rents due to the Company under
non-cancelable operating leases at December 31, 2000 are as follows (in
thousands):

In addition to minimum rents, certain leases require
reimbursements of specified operating expenses which amounted to $114.2
million, $85.1 million, and $56.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Employee
Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a 401(k) plan for the benefit of
its full-time employees. The Company matches the employees' contributions up to
three percent of the employees' salary and may also make annual discretionary
contributions. Total expense recognized by the Company was $3.2 million, $2.3
million and $1.5 million for the years ended 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

The Company makes contributions to a contributory health
and welfare plan as necessary to fund claims not covered by employee
contributions. Total expense recognized by the Company related to this plan was
$6.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million for 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Included in total expense is an estimate based on historical experience
of the effect of claims incurred but not reported as of year-end.

Shareholders'
Equity

The Company periodically accesses the public equity
markets to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental
properties. The proceeds of these offerings are contributed to DWRLP in
exchange for additional interest in the partnership.

The following series of preferred stock are outstanding
as of December 31, 2000 (in thousands, except percentages):

All
series of preferred shares require cumulative distributions, have no stated
maturity date, and the redemption price of each series may only be paid from
the proceeds of other capital shares of the Company, which may include other
classes or series of preferred shares.

The
Preferred Series D shares are convertible at a conversion rate of 9.3677 common
shares for each preferred share outstanding.

The
dividend rate on the Preferred B Series shares increases to 9.99% after
September 12, 2012.

Under
a shareholder rights plan (“Rights Agreement”), each common shareholder has one
right for each share of common stock prior to the occurrence of certain triggering
events which would in effect execute the Rights Agreement. Upon the occurrence
of such events, each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Junior Preferred Stock which
has substantially the same economic attributes and carries substantially the
same voting rights as one share of common stock. As of December 31, 2000, no
events have triggered execution of the Rights Agreement.

In
August 1998, members of management and unaffiliated members of the Company’s
Board of Directors purchased approximately $37 million of common stock of the
Company. In November 1999, an additional $32 million of common stock was
purchased by management and members of the Board of Directors. Both purchases
were financed by five-year personal loans at market interest rates from a
financial institution. Participants are personally responsible for repaying the
interest, principal balance, and other obligations as defined in the Executive
and Senior Officer Stock Purchase Plan. As a condition of the financing
agreement with the financial institution, the Company has guaranteed repayment
of principal, interest and other obligations for each participant, but is fully
indemnified by the participants. In the opinion of management, it is not
probable that the Company will be required to satisfy this guarantee.

Stock Based Compensation

The
Company has eight stock based compensation plans, including fixed stock option
plans and performance based stock plans, which are described below. The Company
is authorized to issue up to 12,084,000 shares of Company stock under these
plans.  The Company applies APB Opinion
No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock option plans as the
exercise price of each option equals the market price of the Company’s stock on
the date of grant. The Company charges compensation costs against its income
for its performance based stock plans. If compensation cost for the Company’s
fixed stock option plans had been determined consistent with SFAS Statement No.
123, the Company’s net income and net income per share for the years ended
December 31 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below (in
thousands, except earnings per share amounts):

Because
the Statement does not apply to awards prior to 1995, and the options have up
to a 5-year vesting period, the pro forma effect was not fully reflected until
2000.

The
fair values of the options were determined using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

Fixed
Stock Option Plans

The
Company had options outstanding under six fixed stock option plans as of
December 31, 2000. Additional grants may be made under three of those
plans.  In 1999, upon the merger of
Weeks Corporation into the Company, the Company assumed all obligations under
two Weeks Corporation stock incentive plans.

A
summary of the status of the Company’s fixed stock option plans as of December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 and changes during the years ended on those dates
follows:

The
options outstanding at December 31, 2000, under the fixed stock option plans
have a range of exercise prices from $11.87 to $24.44 with a weighted average
exercise price of $19.52 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.72
years. The options exercisable at December 31, 2000 have a weighted average
exercise price of $18.39.

Each
option’s maximum term is ten years. 
Excluding the Weeks Corporation plans and with other limited exceptions,
options vest at 20% per year, or, if earlier, upon the death, retirement or
disability of the optionee or a change in control of the Company.  The vesting period of the Weeks Corporation
plans was generally 33 1/3% per year.

Performance
Based Stock Plans

The Company has three
types of performance based equity compensation plans: Dividend Increase Unit
Plans (“DIU Plans”), a Shareholder Value Plan and a Performance Share Plan.
Under the Company’s DIU Plans, Dividend Increase Units (“DIUs”) are granted to
key employees and directors. The value of DIUs exercised by participants is
payable in Company stock.  The maximum
term of all DIUs granted is ten years.

The
value of each DIU when exercised is equal to the increase in the Company’s
annualized dividend per share from the date of grant to the date of exercise,
divided by the “dividend yield.” Dividend yield is the annualized dividend per
share divided by the market price per share of the Company’s common stock at
the date of grant. DIUs are generally subject to a 20% per year vesting
schedule.

Under
the 1995 Shareholder Value Plan (the “SV Plan”), the Company may grant awards
in specified dollar amounts to key employees. The award is payable to the
employee on the third anniversary of the date of grant. One-half of the award
is payable in common stock of the Company, and one-half is payable in cash. The
initial dollar amount of each award granted under the SV Plan is adjusted
upward or downward based on a comparison of the Company’s cumulative total
shareholder return for the three year period as compared to the cumulative
total return of the S&P 500 and the NAREIT Equity REIT Total Return
indices. The award is not payable upon the employee’s termination of employment
for any reason other than retirement, death, disability or a change in control
of the Company.

Awards made under the 2000 Performance Share Plan vest
20% per year if the Company attains a certain predefined levels of earnings
growth for such vesting period. The payments are made in the form of
“performance shares”, with each performance share economically equivalent to
one share of Company common stock. 
Performance shares will ultimately be paid to the participants in the
form of cash or Company common stock upon the retirement or termination of
employment of the participant.  At December
31, 2000, plan participants had the right to receive up to 90,571 performance
shares, contingent upon earnings achievement.

The
Company believes that it is not possible to reasonably estimate the fair value
of the awards to be paid under these performance compensation plans and,
therefore, computes compensation cost for these plans based on the intrinsic
value of the awards as if they were exercised at the end of each applicable
reporting period. The compensation cost that has been charged against income
for these plans was $7.7 million, $5.9 million and $4.1 million for 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies

The
Company has guaranteed $382.4 million of mortgage loans of unconsolidated
companies of which the Company is a 50% partner. The mortgage loans are
collateralized by rental properties of joint ventures which have a net carrying
value substantially in excess of the mortgage loans. The Company does not
anticipate that it will be required to satisfy these guarantees.

The
Company has entered into agreements, subject to the completion of due diligence
requirements, resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary
closing conditions, for the future acquisition of land totaling $40.3 million.
The acquisitions are scheduled to close periodically through 2008 and will be
paid for through a combination of cash and DWRLP Limited Partner Unit issuance.
