PART I

Item 1.  Business

Background

We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon
completion of our initial public offering in February 1986. In October 1993, we completed an additional common stock offering and acquired the rental real estate and service businesses of Duke Associates, whose operations began in 1972. As of
December 31, 2009, our diversified portfolio of 762 rental properties (including 211 jointly controlled in-service properties with more than 43.2 million square feet, four consolidated properties under development with approximately
663,000 square feet and three jointly controlled properties under development with more than 957,000 square feet) encompasses approximately 135.4 million rentable square feet and is leased by a diverse base of approximately 3,500 tenants whose
businesses include manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, distribution, healthcare and professional services. We also own, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures, approximately 5,000 acres of land and control an
additional 1,900 acres through purchase options.

We refined our business strategy in 2009, which includes planned reductions in undeveloped
land inventory in light of lower anticipated development volume and the targeting of non-strategic property dispositions. These decisions further align our focus on markets that we believe offer the best long-term prospects for rental rate growth
and overall demand with an emphasis on industrial and medical office properties. Additionally, we no longer plan to develop properties with the intent to sell them at or near completion.

Through our Service Operations reportable segment, we have historically developed or acquired properties with the intent to sell (hereafter referred to as “Build-for-Sale” properties).
Build-for-Sale properties were generally identified as such prior to construction commencement and were sold within a relatively short time after being placed in service. Build-for-Sale properties, which are no longer part of our operating strategy,
did not represent a significant component of our operations in 2009.

Our Service Operations also provide, on a fee basis, leasing, property
and asset management, development, construction, build-to-suit and other tenant-related services. We conduct our Service Operations through Duke Realty Services LLC, Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited Partnership.
Our Rental Operations are conducted through Duke Realty Limited Partnership. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” for financial information related to our reportable segments.

Our headquarters and executive offices are located in
Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition, we have 17 regional offices located in Alexandria, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Nashville, Tennessee; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Raleigh, North Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Weston, Florida. We had approximately 1,000 employees as of December 31, 2009.

Operational Objectives

Our primary operational objective is to drive operational efficiencies, by maximizing cash from operations and Funds From Operations (“FFO”), through (i) maintaining and increasing property
occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets when economic conditions improve or when accretive
returns are present; (iii) using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction manager in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis; and (iv) providing a full line of real estate services to
our tenants and to third parties. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT like Duke. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO
as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. Consolidated basic FFO attributable to common shareholders should not be considered as a substitute
for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that
was adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results
for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of
previously depreciated real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of FFO attributable to common shareholders, combined with net income (which remains the required primary measure of
performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously
depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, investors and analysts are able to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity and assist
in comparing these operating results between periods or as compared to different companies.

As a fully integrated commercial real estate
firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage both as a
real estate operator and in future development activities.

We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done
most effectively at regional or local levels. As a result, we intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market share and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to
assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on strong customer relationships to provide third-party
construction services across the United States. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our industrial, office and medical office customers not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also
additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.

All of our properties are
located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets.
The supply and demand of similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant
services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator. In addition, our Service Operations face competition from a considerable number of other real estate companies that provide comparable services, some of whom may have greater marketing
and financial resources than are available to us.

Capital Strategy

Our strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure, in conjunction with the execution of our overall operating strategy, while continuing to maintain investment grade ratings from
our credit rating agencies and to ultimately improve the key metrics that drive these credit ratings.

In support of our capital strategy, as
well as our overall business strategy, we employ an asset disposition program to sell non-strategic real estate assets, which generates proceeds that can be recycled into new properties that better fit our growth objectives in industrial and medical
office properties or can be utilized to reduce our leverage.

We seek to reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet by maintaining a
balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less
than 20%; (iii) issuing common equity from time-to-time to maintain appropriate leverage parameters; and (iv) generating proceeds from the sale of non-strategic properties. By focusing on strengthening our balance sheet, we expect to be
well-positioned for future growth.

In addition, as discussed under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” we have an $850.0 million unsecured line of credit available for our capital needs.

Corporate
Governance

Since our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer operationally, but also to lead in issues important to
investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. Our system of governance reinforces this commitment. Summarized below are the highlights of our Corporate Governance initiatives.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this Report, you should carefully consider, in consultation with your legal, financial and other professional advisors, the risks described below, as well
as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption “Risk Factors” in evaluating us and our business before making a decision regarding an investment in our securities.

The risks contained in this Report are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem to be
immaterial, also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. The trading price of our securities could decline due to the materialization of any of these risks, and our shareholders
may lose all or part of their investment.

This Report also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of certain
factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section in this Report entitled “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for additional
information regarding forward-looking statements.

Risks Related to Our Business

Our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required principal
and interest payments and the long-term risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness, or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to
refinance borrowings at our unconsolidated subsidiaries on favorable terms or at all. If our debt cannot be paid, refinanced or extended, we may not be able to make distributions to shareholders at expected levels. Further, if prevailing interest
rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher interest rates or other restrictive financial covenants upon the refinancing, then such refinancing would adversely affect our cash flow and funds available for operation,
development and distribution.

We are also subject to financial covenants under our existing debt instruments. Should we fail to comply with
the covenants in our existing debt instruments, then we would not only be in breach under the applicable debt instruments but we would also likely be unable to borrow any further amounts under our other debt instruments, which could adversely affect
our ability to fund operations. We also have incurred, and may incur in the future, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Thus, if market interest rates increase, so will our debt expense, which could reduce our cash flow and our
ability to make distributions to shareholders at expected levels.

Debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be
dilutive to our shareholders.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt
financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. Debt financing may not be available over a longer period of time in sufficient amounts, on
favorable terms or at all. If we issue additional equity securities, instead of debt, to manage capital needs, the interests of our existing shareholders could be diluted.

Financial and other covenants under existing credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.

The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as
maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the
applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow would be adversely affected.

If we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity, then we may be unable to pursue future development projects and other
strategic initiatives.

To complete our ongoing and planned development projects, and to pursue our other strategic initiatives, we must
continue to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to fund those activities. To generate that capital and liquidity, we rely upon funds from our existing operations, as well as funds that we raise through our capital raising activities. In the
event that we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our long-term needs, or if we are unable to generate capital and liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, then we may not be able to pursue development projects,
acquisitions, or our other long-term strategic initiatives.

- 6 -


Our stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to our
shareholders.

The market price of our common and preferred stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our
industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price, or
result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock, include recent uncertainty in the markets, general market and economic conditions, as well as those factors described in these “Risk Factors” and in other reports
that we file with the SEC.

Many of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our
common and preferred stock. If the market prices of our common and preferred stock decline, then our shareholders may be unable to resell their shares upon terms that are attractive to them. We cannot assure that the market price of our common and
preferred stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the securities markets in general may experience considerable unexpected price and volume fluctuations.

We may issue debt and equity securities which are senior to our common stock and preferred stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could
negatively affect the value of our common and preferred stock.

In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by
entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by certain of our assets, or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes,
subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock and
preferred stock. Our preferred stock has a preference over our common stock with respect to distributions and upon liquidation, which could further limit our ability to make distributions to our common shareholders. Any additional preferred stock
that we may issue may have a preference over our common stock and existing series of preferred stock with respect to distributions and upon liquidation.

We may be required to seek commercial credit and issue debt securities to manage our capital needs. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market
conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of
our securities in the future. Thus, our shareholders will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of their shares of common stock and diluting their interest in us.

Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.

We
currently have joint ventures that are not consolidated with our financial statements. We may develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation
in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:

•

We could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property;

•

Our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of
properties;

•

Our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues; and

•

Maturities of debt encumbering our jointly owned investments may not be able to be refinanced at all or on terms that are as favorable as the current
terms.

- 7 -


Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders could decrease as a result of factors related to the ownership and operation of
commercial real estate that are outside of our control.

Our business is subject to the risks incident to the ownership and operation of
commercial real estate, many of which involve circumstances not within our control. Such risks include the following:

•

Changes in the general economic climate;

•

The availability of capital on favorable terms, or at all;

•

Increases in interest rates;

•

Local conditions such as oversupply of property or a reduction in demand;

•

Competition for tenants;

•

Changes in market rental rates;

•

Oversupply or reduced demand for space in the areas where our properties are located;

•

Delay or inability to collect rent from tenants who are bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise unwilling or unable to pay;

•

Difficulty in leasing or re-leasing space quickly or on favorable terms;

•

Costs associated with periodically renovating, repairing and reletting rental space;

•

Our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance on our properties;

•

Our ability to control variable operating costs;

•

Changes in government regulations; and

•

Potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, tax and other laws.

Further, a significant portion of our costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs and our debt service payments, are generally not
reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in cash flow from our properties. Any one or more of these factors could result in a reduction in our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders.

Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from properties decreases.

Our financial results depend on leasing space in our real estate to tenants on terms favorable to us. Our income and funds available for distribution to our shareholders will decrease if a significant
number of our tenants cannot meet their lease obligations to us or we are unable to lease properties on favorable terms. In addition, if a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and we may
incur substantial legal costs. Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment.

- 8 -


Our real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to development.

Although we have significantly reduced our development activities, we may still pursue select opportunities and have previously started developments that
are currently in various stages of completion. These development activities generally require various government and other approvals, which we may not receive. In addition, we also are subject to the following risks associated with development
activities:

•

Unsuccessful development opportunities could result in direct expenses to us;

•

Construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated, or possibly
unprofitable;

•

Time required to complete the construction of a project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby
adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity;

•

Occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable;

•

Our ability to dispose of properties developed with the intent to sell or other properties we identify for sale could be impacted by the ability of
prospective buyers to obtain financing given the current state of the credit markets; and

•

Favorable sources to fund our development activities may not be available.

We may be unsuccessful in operating completed real estate projects.

We face the risk that the real estate projects we develop or acquire will not perform in accordance with our expectations. This risk exists because of factors such as the following:

•

Prices paid for acquired facilities are based upon a series of market judgments; and

•

Costs of any improvements required to bring an acquired facility up to standards to establish the market position intended for that facility might
exceed budgeted costs.

Further, we can give no assurance that acquisition targets meeting our guidelines for quality and
yield will be available, should we seek them.

We are exposed to the risks of defaults by tenants.

Any of our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken their financial condition. In the event of default or the insolvency of a
significant number of our tenants, we may experience a substantial loss of rental revenue and/or delays in collecting rent and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection, a court could
allow the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants became unable to meet their obligations to us, became insolvent or declared
bankruptcy.

We may be unable to renew leases or relet space.

When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if our tenants do renew or we are able to relet the space, the terms of renewal or
reletting (including the cost of renovations, if necessary) may be less favorable than current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space, or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly
lower than current rates, then our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected, especially if we were unable to lease a significant amount of the space vacated by tenants in our properties.

- 9 -


Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our facilities, including property, liability, fire, flood and extended coverage. We believe this coverage is
of the type and amount customarily obtained for real property. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not
economically insurable. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance
coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and
other factors also may make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive may not be adequate to restore our economic position in a
property. If an insured loss occurred, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property, and we would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property.
Although we believe our insurance is with highly rated providers, we are also subject to the risk that such providers may be unwilling or unable to pay our claims when made.

Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.

From time to time, we may acquire
properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay
substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:

•

liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

•

claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;

•

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

We could be exposed to significant environmental liabilities as a result of conditions of which we currently are not
aware.

As an owner and operator of real property, we may be liable under various federal, state and local laws for the costs of removal
or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. In addition, we
could have greater difficulty in selling real estate on which hazardous substances were present or in obtaining borrowings using such real estate as collateral. It is our general policy to have Phase I environmental audits performed for all of our
properties and land by qualified environmental consultants. These Phase I environmental audits have not revealed any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on our business. However, a Phase I environmental audit does not
involve invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, and we cannot be sure that the Phase I environmental audits did not fail to reveal a significant environmental liability or that a prior owner did not create a material
environmental condition on our properties or land which has not yet been discovered. We could also incur environmental liability as a result of future uses or conditions of such real estate or changes in applicable environmental laws.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

If we were to cease to qualify as a REIT, we and our shareholders would lose significant tax benefits.

We intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Qualification as a
REIT provides significant tax advantages to us and our shareholders. However, in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are
only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. Satisfaction of these requirements also depends on various factual circumstances not entirely within our control. The fact that we hold our assets through an operating partnership and its
subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Although we believe that we can continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot offer any
assurance that we will continue to do so or that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the qualification requirements or the federal income tax consequences of qualification. If
we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would have the following effects:

•

We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders and would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative
minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

•

Unless we were entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT;

•

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders would decrease due to the additional tax liability for the year or years
involved; and

•

We would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders in order to qualify as a REIT.

As such, failure to qualify as a REIT would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities.

REIT distribution requirements limit the amount of cash we have available for other business purposes, including amounts that we need to fund our future
capital needs.

To maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must annually distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of
our ordinary taxable income, excluding net capital gains. We intend to continue to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the 90% distribution requirement. However, this requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital for use for
other business purposes. If we do not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements, we may have to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements. If we fail to
make a required distribution, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and investments in REITs may
change, which may result in the loss of our tax benefits of operating as a REIT.

The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of a REIT
and an investment in a REIT may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time. Revisions in U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect us and the tax consequences of an
investment in our common shares.

We are subject to certain provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, which may
reduce the likelihood of our shareholders receiving a control premium for their shares.

Indiana anti-takeover legislation and certain
provisions in our governing documents, as we discuss below, may discourage potential acquirers from pursuing a change-of-control transaction with us. As a result, our shareholders may be less likely to receive a control premium for their shares.

Unissued Preferred Stock.

Our charter permits our board of directors to classify unissued preferred stock by setting the rights
and preferences of the shares at the time of issuance. This power enables our board to adopt a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill. Although we have repealed our previously existing poison pill and our current board of directors has
adopted a policy not to issue preferred stock as an anti-takeover measure, our board can change this policy at any time. The adoption of a poison pill would discourage a potential bidder from acquiring a significant position in the company without
the approval of our board.

Business-Combination Provisions of Indiana Law.

We have not opted out of the business-combination
provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law. As a result, potential bidders may have to negotiate with our board of directors before acquiring 10% of our stock. Without securing board approval of the proposed business combination before
crossing the 10% ownership threshold, a bidder would not be permitted to complete a business combination for five years after becoming a 10% shareholder. Even after the five-year period, a business combination with the significant shareholder would
require a “fair price” as defined in the Indiana Business Corporation Law or the approval of a majority of the disinterested shareholders.

Control-Share-Acquisition Provisions of Indiana Law.

We have not opted out of the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law regarding acquisitions of control shares. Therefore, those who acquire a significant block (at
least 20%) of our shares may only vote a portion of their shares unless our other shareholders vote to accord full voting rights to the acquiring person. Moreover, if the other shareholders vote to give full voting rights with respect to the control
shares and the acquiring person has acquired a majority of our outstanding shares, the other shareholders would be entitled to special dissenters’ rights.

Supermajority Voting Provisions.

Our charter prohibits business combinations or significant disposition transactions with a holder of 10% of our shares unless:

•

The holders of 80% of our outstanding shares of capital stock approve the transaction;

•

The transaction has been approved by three-fourths of those directors who served on the board before the shareholder became a 10% owner; or

•

The significant shareholder complies with the “fair price” provisions of our charter.

Among the transactions with large shareholders requiring the supermajority shareholder approval are dispositions of assets with a value greater than or
equal to $1,000,000 and business combinations.

Operating Partnership Provisions.

The limited partnership agreement of DRLP
contains provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, including a requirement that holders of at least 90% of the outstanding partnership units held by us and other unit holders approve:

•

Any voluntary sale, exchange, merger, consolidation or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of DRLP in one or more transactions
other than a disposition occurring upon a financing or refinancing of DRLP;

•

Our merger, consolidation or other business combination with another entity unless after the transaction substantially all of the assets of the
surviving entity are contributed to DRLP in exchange for units;

- 12 -


•

Our transfer of our interests in DRLP other than to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries; and

•

Any reclassification or recapitalization or change of outstanding shares of our common stock other than certain changes in par value, stock splits,
stock dividends or combinations.

We are dependent on key personnel.

Our executive officers and other senior officers have a significant role in the success of our Company. Our ability to retain our management group or to
attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave our Company is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their
availability could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments

Sales of Unregistered Securities

We did not sell any of our securities during the year ended December 31, 2009 that were not registered under the Securities Act.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

From time to time, we repurchase our securities under a repurchase program that initially was approved by the board of directors and publicly announced in October 2001 (the “Repurchase Program”). In October 2008, the board of
directors adopted a resolution (the “October 2008 resolution”) that reaffirmed management’s authority to repurchase common shares under the Repurchase Program and also amended the Repurchase Program to permit the repurchase of
outstanding series of preferred shares, as well as any outstanding series of debt securities. The October 2008 resolution, which expired in October 2009, also limited management’s authority to repurchase a maximum of $75.0 million of common
shares, $75.0 million of debt securities and $25.0 million of preferred shares. In December 2008, the board of directors granted management further authority (the “December 2008 resolution”), in addition to the previous $75.0 million
authorization, to repurchase any outstanding debt securities maturing through December 31, 2011. The December 2008 resolution expires on March 17, 2010. Under the Repurchase Program, we also execute share repurchases on an ongoing basis
associated with certain employee elections under our compensation and benefit programs.

The following table shows the share repurchase
activity for each of the three months in the quarter ended December 31, 2009:

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data

The following sets forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for each of the years in the five-year period ended
December 31, 2009. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” included in this Form 10-K (in thousands, except per share amounts):

(1) Funds From Operations
(“FFO”) is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) like Duke. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
(“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted United
States of America (“GAAP”). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. Consolidated basic FFO attributable to common shareholders should not be considered
as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the
definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP
implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of
operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses
from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of consolidated basic FFO attributable to common shareholders, combined with net income (which remains the primary measure
of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of
previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, investors and analysts are able to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity
and assist in comparing these operating results between periods or as compared to different companies.

See reconciliation of FFO to GAAP net
income (loss) attributable to common shareholders under the caption “Year in Review” under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations through a related entity in 1972. As of December 31, 2009, we:

•

Owned or jointly controlled 762 industrial, office, medical office and other properties, of which 755 properties with more than 133.8 million
square feet are in service and seven properties with more than 1.6 million square feet are under development. The 755 in-service properties are comprised of 544 consolidated properties with approximately 90.6 million square feet and 211
jointly controlled properties with more than 43.2 million square feet. The seven properties under development consist of four consolidated properties with approximately 663,000 square feet and three jointly controlled properties with more than
957,000 square feet.

•

Owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures, approximately 5,000 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,900
acres through purchase options.

We refined our business strategy in 2009, which includes planned reductions in undeveloped
land inventory in light of lower anticipated development volume and the targeting of non-strategic property dispositions. These decisions further align our focus on markets that we believe offer the best long-term prospects for rental rate growth
and overall demand with an emphasis on industrial and medical office properties. Additionally, we no longer plan to develop properties with the intent to sell them at or near completion.

Through our Service Operations reportable segment, we have historically developed or acquired properties with the intent to sell (hereafter referred to as “Build-for-Sale” properties).
Build-for-Sale properties were generally identified as such prior to construction commencement and were sold within a relatively short time after being placed in service. Build-for-Sale properties, which are no longer part of our operating strategy,
did not represent a significant component of our operations in 2009.

Our Service Operations reportable segment, which includes our taxable
REIT subsidiary, also provides the following services for our properties and for certain properties owned by third parties and joint ventures:

•

Property leasing;

•

Property management;

•

Asset management;

•

Construction;

•

Development; and

•

Other tenant-related services.

Capital Strategy

Our strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure, in conjunction with the
execution of our overall operating strategy, while continuing to maintain investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies and to ultimately improve the key metrics that drive these credit ratings.

In support of our capital strategy, as well as our overall business strategy, we employ an asset disposition program to sell non-strategic real estate
assets, which generates proceeds that can be recycled into new properties that better fit our growth objectives in industrial and medical office properties or can be utilized to reduce our leverage.

We seek to reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet by maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and
sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than 20%; (iii) issuing common equity from time-to-time to maintain
appropriate leverage parameters; and (iv) generating proceeds from the sale of non-strategic properties. By focusing on strengthening our balance sheet, we expect to be well-positioned for future growth.

- 18 -


Operational Objectives

Our primary operational objective is to drive operational efficiencies, by maximizing cash from operations and Funds From Operations (“FFO”), through (i) maintaining and increasing property
occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets when economic conditions improve or when accretive
returns are present; (iii) using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction manager in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis; and (iv) providing a full line of real estate services to
our tenants and to third parties.

Year in Review

Overall, the economy and business fundamentals experienced substantial deterioration in 2009, especially in the first six months of the year. The most significant factor driving operating decisions and
results was the lack of available capital in the marketplace.

With a focus on securing our future liquidity position to withstand the
continuing challenges in the economy, and to be positioned for future growth, we demonstrated our ability to access multiple capital sources and completed several major financing transactions in 2009. These financing transactions, along with asset
dispositions completed during the year, generated over $1.6 billion of new capital in 2009. Major financing transactions included a common equity issuance that generated $575.0 million of proceeds, the issuance of $500.0 million of unsecured notes,
$290.4 million of additional borrowings on secured loans and the renewal of our unsecured line of credit at a borrowing capacity of $850.0 million through February 2013.

The refinement of our business strategy, as well as the deep recession and financial market instability that adversely affected real estate values, caused us to recognize asset impairment charges of
$303.6 million in 2009 and $19.7 million in 2008. Despite the recessionary climate and lack of available capital for buyers, we were able to successfully execute several land and building disposition transactions in 2009 that generated $300.9
million in gross proceeds.

The economic recession and general turmoil in the financial markets that began in late 2007 continued to
negatively impact the real estate industry throughout 2009. There continues to be a tremendous oversupply of space across all product types and in all markets in the commercial real estate industry. As a result, many owners are willing to offer
significant concessions to compete for potential tenants, which is driving down rental rates and resulting in large capital expenditures in many cases. Leasing activity has been slower than anticipated, a reflection of the broader economy, which led
to a slight decline in our total occupancy.

Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2009, was
$333.6 million, or $1.67 per share (diluted), compared to net income of $50.4 million, or $0.33 per share (diluted) for the year ended 2008. The loss attributable to common shareholders was driven primarily by $303.6 million of non-cash asset
impairment charges recognized during the year and a $49.2 million decrease in total gains on land and building sales. Additionally, we incurred a $21.8 million increase in interest expense that was driven by a decrease in interest costs capitalized
to development projects. FFO attributable to common shareholders totaled $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $369.7 million for 2008, with the decrease resulting from the same factors that drove the loss attributable
to common shareholders in 2009.

Industry analysts and investors use FFO as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real
estate investment trust (“REIT”). The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other
items, from net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) attributable
to common shareholders. Consolidated basic FFO attributable to common shareholders should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not
be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value
of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate
companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously
depreciated real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of consolidated basic FFO attributable to common shareholders, combined with net income (which remains the primary measure
of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of
previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, investors and analysts are able to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity
and assist in comparing these operating results between periods or as compared to different companies. The following table shows a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to the calculation of consolidated basic FFO
attributable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):

During 2009, we continued to execute within our core areas of competency, while planning for the longer term effects of the
economic recession. Highlights of our operating activities are as follows:

•

We made outright sales, or completed partial sales to unconsolidated joint ventures, of 15 wholly owned buildings for $267.0 million of gross proceeds
and also generated $33.9 million of gross proceeds from the divestiture of non-strategic land parcels.

•

As a result of refinements to our strategy, combined to a lesser extent with a market-wide decline in asset values due to the economic downturn, we
recognized $303.6 million of impairment charges on land, buildings, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other real estate related assets during 2009.

•

We have continued to limit our new development starts to selected projects in markets or product types expected to have strong future rent growth and
demand or projects that have significant pre-leasing. The total estimated cost of our consolidated properties under construction was $122.2 million at December 31, 2009 with $91.9 million of such costs incurred through that date. Our total
estimated cost for jointly controlled properties under construction was $318.4 million at December 31, 2009 with $126.5 million of costs incurred through that date.

- 20 -


•

The occupancy level for our in-service portfolio of consolidated properties decreased from 88.1% at December 31, 2008 to 87.6% at
December 31, 2009. The decrease was due to the continuation of the 2008 trend of recently completed speculative buildings being placed in service and not being fully leased, as well as the impact of the economy on users of office and bulk
industrial space.

•

Despite the continued challenges presented by the overall economy, total leasing activity for our consolidated properties totaled 15.3 million
square feet in 2009 compared to 14.7 million square feet in 2008.

•

Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties in 2009 totaled 8.8 million square feet of renewals, which represented an 82.0% success
rate and attained a 2.2% growth in net effective rents.

We engaged in a number of financing activities
during 2009 to adapt to conditions in the credit markets. Highlights of our key financing activities in 2009 are as follows:

•

In February 2009, we repaid $124.0 million of 6.83% corporate unsecured debt at its scheduled maturity date.

•

In April 2009, we issued 75.2 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $551.4 million.

•

During 2009, we borrowed a total of $290.4 million from six secured debt financings that are secured by 35 rental properties. The secured debt bears
interest at a weighted average rate of 7.5%. The composition of these properties as far as product type, geographic location, and overall operating metrics are diverse and similar to our overall portfolio of unsecured properties.

•

In August 2009, we issued $500.0 million of unsecured notes in two equal tranches. The first $250.0 million of the unsecured notes will mature in
February 2015 and bear interest at an effective rate of 7.50% while the other $250.0 million of the notes mature in August 2019 and bear interest at an effective rate of 8.38%.

•

During 2009, we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in 2009 through 2011. In total, we paid $500.9
million for unsecured notes that had a face value of $542.9 million, recognizing a net gain on extinguishment of approximately $27.5 million after considering the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts and other accounting
adjustments. Partially offsetting the aforementioned gains was a $6.8 million charge to write-off fees paid for a cancelled secured transaction.

•

In order to strengthen our liquidity position going forward and to preserve cash for future debt maturities, in January 2009 the board of directors
reduced our annual dividend from $1.94 per share to $1.00 per share. Our dividend was further reduced in the second quarter of 2009 to $0.68 per share on an annualized basis which, as a result of the issuance of additional shares in the April 2009
common stock offering, was necessary for us to maintain our planned level of aggregate dividend payments for 2009.

Key Performance Indicators

Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our industrial, office, medical office and retail properties (collectively referred to as “Rental Operations”). The following
discussion highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider critical drivers of future revenues.

Occupancy Analysis:

As discussed above, our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue from continuing operations. The following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in-service portfolio
of consolidated rental properties as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

The decrease in occupancy at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 is primarily the result of
developments that were not fully leased being placed in service during 2008 and 2009, as well as the effect of the economic downturn on our tenant base. Certain of the developments placed in service during 2008 and 2009 were built with the intention
to sell shortly after completion but, due to the deterioration in economic conditions, were not sold and are being held as rental properties for the foreseeable future. Our ongoing ability to maintain favorable occupancy levels may be adversely
affected by the continued effects of the economic recession on current and prospective tenants and such a reduction in the level of occupancy may have an adverse impact on revenues from rental operations.

Lease Expiration and Renewals:

Our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re-lease
expiring space. The following table reflects our consolidated in-service portfolio lease expiration schedule by property type as of December 31, 2009. The table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents (based on December 2009
rental revenue) under expiring leases (in thousands, except percentage data):

We renewed 82.0% and 71.3% of our leases up for renewal totaling approximately 8.8 million and
5.5 million square feet in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We attained 2.2% growth in net effective rents on these renewals during 2009, compared to 1.4% in 2008. Growth in net effective rent in 2008 was negatively affected by one significant
early lease renewal and would have been 5.7% if that renewal were excluded. Our lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent at a 70-80% success rate. The effects of current economic conditions upon our
base of existing tenants may adversely affect our ability to continue to achieve this renewal rate.

- 22 -


Future Development:

Another source of our earnings growth is our wholly owned and joint
venture development activities. We expect to generate future earnings from Rental Operations income as the development properties are placed in service and leased. Considering the current state of the economy and the risks presented by constraints
on our ability to access capital on favorable terms, we have reduced the level of our new development activities pending improvements in the economy and capital markets and are focused on the lease-up of recently completed and under development
projects.

We had 1.6 million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of $440.6 million at
December 31, 2009, compared to 4.0 million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of $729.2 million at December 31, 2008. The square footage and estimated costs include both wholly owned and joint venture
development activity at 100%.

Acquisition and Disposition Activity:

Gross sales
proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned undeveloped land and buildings totaled $300.9 million in 2009, compared to $473.6 million in 2008. Our share of proceeds from sales of properties within unconsolidated joint ventures in which we
have less than a 100% interest totaled $35.1 million in 2008, and we had no such dispositions in 2009.

We intend to continue to pursue
disposition opportunities for non-strategic properties and land in accordance with our strategy. We believe that the number of dispositions we execute in 2010 will be impacted by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain favorable financing or pay
cash, given the current state of the economy and credit markets in particular.

In 2009, we acquired $32.1 million of income producing
properties comprised of three industrial real estate properties in Savannah, Georgia, compared to acquisitions of $60.5 million of income producing properties in the same market in 2008. We also acquired $6.2 million of undeveloped land in 2009,
compared to $42.7 million in 2008.

Results of Operations

A summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, is as follows (in thousands, except number of properties and per
share data):

Comparison of Year Ended
December 31, 2009 to Year Ended December 31, 2008

Rental and Related Revenue

Overall, rental and related revenue from continuing operations increased from $857.6 million in 2008 to $894.6 million in 2009. The following table sets
forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands):

The primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing
operations, with specific references to a particular segment when applicable, are summarized below:

•

In 2009, we acquired three properties, consolidated two retail properties in which we previously had a partial ownership interest, and placed 15
developments in service. The acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of $1.4 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The two retail properties that were consolidated in 2009 provided $16.3 million of incremental revenues. Of the
development properties placed in service in 2009, ten were medical office properties accounting for $4.1 million of the $7.2 million incremental revenues.

•

Acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in 2008 provided $422,000 and $31.9 million, respectively, of incremental revenue in 2009.

•

Rental revenue from continuing operations includes lease termination fees. Lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate
their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term. Lease termination fees increased from $9.4 million in 2008 to $14.2 million in 2009.

- 24 -


•

We contributed five properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in 2008, resulting in a $2.2 million reduction in revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008.

•

The increase in rental revenues was partially offset by a $6.8 million increase in expense related to doubtful receivables, including both contractual
and straight-line receivables, as a result of economic conditions during 2009.

•

Decreases in rental rates and occupancy in certain of our existing properties, resulting from the economy’s impact on the leasing environment,
partially offset the above-mentioned items.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations for
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands):

Of the overall $12.3 million increase in rental expenses in 2009
compared to 2008, $10.2 million was attributable to properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009.

Of the overall $15.3 million increase in real estate taxes in 2009 compared to 2008, $9.8 million was attributable to properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service from
January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. The remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in tax rates and assessed values on our existing properties.

Service Operations

The following table sets forth the components of the Service
Operations reportable segment (excluding Build-for-Sale Properties) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands):

Service Operations primarily consist of the leasing, management, development, construction management and general contractor
services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. Service Operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and
development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners and joint venture partners. Earnings from Service Operations increased from $15.9 million in 2008 to $21.8 million in 2009. The increase in earnings
from Service Operations was primarily a result of general contractor expenses being higher than usual in 2008 as a result of increases in our total cost estimates for two third-party fixed price construction contracts, which reduced the margins on
the contracts.

- 25 -


Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $308.1 million in 2008 to $339.0 million in 2009 due to increases in our real estate asset base from properties acquired or consolidated and
developments placed in service during 2008 and 2009.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income or loss from investments in unconsolidated companies that generally own and operate rental
properties and develop properties for sale. Equity in earnings decreased from $23.8 million in 2008 to $9.9 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily a result of our share of the gain on sale of five properties from unconsolidated subsidiaries in
2008 totaling $10.1 million, compared to no such sales in 2009. The decreased gains on property sales were partially offset as the result of consolidating two retail joint ventures in April 2009, for which our share of net loss was $3.5 million in
2008. The remaining decrease in equity in earnings is primarily due to a decrease in operating income within certain of our joint ventures due to decreased occupancy in the underlying rental properties.

Gain on Sale of Properties

Gains on sales
of properties decreased from $39.1 million in 2008 to $12.3 million in 2009. We sold 14 properties in 2008 compared to nine properties in 2009. The properties sold in 2008 were part of our Build-for-Sale program, which is no longer a significant
part of our Service Operations. Because the properties sold in 2008 and 2009 either had insignificant operations prior to sale or because we maintained varying forms of continuing involvement after sale, they are not classified within discontinued
operations.

Earnings from Sales of Land

Earnings from sales of land decreased from $12.7 million in 2008 to $357,000 in 2009. The decrease in earnings was the result of the current state of the real estate market, as fewer developers are
willing to make speculative purchases of land for future development.

Impairment Charges

Impairment charges classified in continuing operations include the impairment of undeveloped land and buildings, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries
and other real estate related assets. The increase from $18.5 million in 2008 to $302.8 million in 2009 is primarily due to a refinement of our business strategy coupled with decreases in real estate values and is comprised of the following
activity:

•

A result of the refinement of our business strategy was the decision to dispose of approximately 1,800 acres of land, which had a total cost basis of
$385.3 million, rather than holding it for future development. Our change in strategy for this land triggered the requirement to conduct an impairment analysis, which resulted in a determination that a significant portion of the land was impaired.
We recognized impairment charges on land of $136.6 million in 2009, primarily as the result of writing down to fair value the land that was identified for disposition and determined to be impaired.

- 26 -


•

Additionally, an impairment charge of $78.1 million was recognized in 2009 for 28 office, industrial and retail buildings. One of these properties met
the criteria for discontinued operations upon sale and the $772,000 impairment charge related to this property is accordingly reflected in discontinued operations. An impairment analysis of certain of our buildings was triggered either as the result
of changes in management’s strategy, resulting in certain buildings being identified as non-strategic, or changes in market conditions.

•

We have an investment in an unconsolidated entity (the “3630 Peachtree joint venture”) whose sole activity is the development and operation
of the office component of a multi-use office and residential high-rise building located in the Buckhead sub-market of Atlanta. We recognized an impairment charge in 2009 to write off our $14.4 million investment in the 3630 Peachtree joint venture
as the result of the other-than-temporary decline in value. As a result of the joint venture’s obligations to the lender in its construction loan agreement, the likelihood that our partner will be unable to contribute their share of the
additional equity to fund the joint venture’s future capital costs, and ultimately from our contingent obligation stemming from our joint and several guarantee of the joint venture’s loan, we recorded an additional liability of $36.3
million for our probable future obligation to the lender.

•

In 2009, we recognized a $5.8 million charge on our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (the “Park Creek joint venture”).

•

We recognized $32.5 million of impairment charges on other real estate related assets in 2009 compared to $8.3 million of charges in 2008. The
impairment charges in 2009 related primarily to reserving loans receivable from other real estate entities, as well as writing off previously deferred development costs. Impairment charges recognized on other real estate related assets during 2008
were the result of writing off previously deferred development costs.

•

In 2008, as the result of a re-assessment of our intended use of some of our land holdings, we recognized non-cash impairment charges on seven of our
tracts of undeveloped land totaling $8.6 million. Additionally, as the result of the economy’s negative effect on real estate selling prices, we recognized $2.8 million of impairment charges on two of our Build-for-Sale properties that were
under construction at December 31, 2008, as they were expected to sell in 2009. One of these properties met the criteria for discontinued operations upon sale and the $1.3 million impairment charge related to this property is accordingly
reflected in discontinued operations.

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased from $39.5 million in 2008 to $47.9 million in 2009. General and administrative expenses consist of two
components. The first component includes general corporate expenses and the second component includes the indirect operating costs not allocated to the development or operations of our owned properties and Service Operations. Those indirect costs
not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of a $4.8 million increase in severance pay. Other than this expense item, we reduced
our total overhead costs by $22.7 million to compensate for the reduction in the volume of leasing and construction activity. However, the absorption of actual overhead costs by an allocation to leasing, construction and other areas decreased by
$26.3 million, which, when netted with the $22.7 million reduction in costs, resulted in the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses.

- 27 -


Interest Expense

Interest expense from continuing operations increased from $198.4 million in 2008 to $220.2 million in 2009, primarily as a result of a $26.6 million decrease in capitalization of interest costs, due to
properties previously undergoing significant development activities being placed in service or otherwise not meeting the criteria for the capitalization of interest. Additionally, as the result of the conditions in the credit markets driving up
interest rates on new borrowings in 2009, the weighted average interest rate on our total outstanding borrowings increased from 5.43% at December 31, 2008 to 6.36% at December 31, 2009.

Gain on Debt Transactions

During 2009, we
repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in 2009 through 2011. The majority of our debt repurchases during 2009 were of our 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Exchangeable Notes”). In total, we
paid $500.9 million for unsecured notes that had a face value of $542.9 million, recognizing a net gain on extinguishment of approximately $27.5 million after considering the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts and other
accounting adjustments. Partially offsetting these gains, we recognized $6.8 million of expense in 2009 for the write-off of fees paid for a pending secured financing that we cancelled in the third quarter of 2009.

Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax
benefit of $6.1 million and $7.0 million, respectively, in 2009 and 2008.

We recorded a net valuation allowance of $7.3 million against our
deferred tax assets during 2009. The valuation allowance was recorded as the result of changes to our projections for future taxable income within our taxable REIT subsidiary. The decreased projection of taxable income was the result of a revision
in strategy, whereby we determined that we would indefinitely discontinue the development of Build-for-Sale properties, necessitating the revision of our taxable income projections.

Notwithstanding the valuation allowance recorded during 2009, our taxable REIT subsidiary recognized significantly higher taxable losses in 2009 than in 2008 as the result of the timing and profitability
of land and building sales.

Discontinued Operations

The results of operations for properties sold during the year to unrelated parties or classified as held-for-sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations. The
property specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes, allocated interest expense and depreciation expense, as well as the net gain or loss on the
disposition of properties.

The operations of 45 buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations. These 45 properties consist of
20 industrial and 25 office properties. As a result, we classified income (loss), before gain on sales, of $(439,000), $3.2 million and $5.6 million in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Of these properties, five were sold during 2009, eight properties were sold during 2008 and 32 properties were sold during 2007. The gains on
disposal of these properties of $6.8 million, $17.0 million and $121.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are also reported in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations also includes impairment
charges of $772,000 and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, recognized on properties that were subsequently sold.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2008 to Year Ended December 31, 2007

Rental and Related Revenue

Overall, rental revenue from continuing operations increased from $810.5 million in 2007 to $857.6 million in 2008. The following table reconciles rental revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment to our total reported rental
revenue from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):

The primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing
operations, with specific references to a particular segment when applicable, are summarized below:

•

In 2008, we acquired five new properties and placed 36 developments in service. These acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of
$3.5 million and $20.4 million, respectively.

•

Acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in 2007 provided $10.3 million and $37.7 million, respectively, of incremental revenue in
2008.

•

We sold eight properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in 2007, resulting in an $11.2 million reduction in revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2008, as compared to the same period in 2007. Of these properties, seven were sold in the second quarter of 2007 and one was sold in the fourth quarter of 2007.

•

Rental revenue from continuing operations includes lease termination fees. Lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate
their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term. Lease termination fees decreased from $24.2 million in 2007 to $9.4 million in 2008.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table reconciles rental expenses and
real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):

- 29 -


Of the overall $15.2 million increase in rental expenses in 2008 compared to 2007, $11.5 million was
attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2008. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in rental expenses of $2.0 million resulting from the sale of eight
properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in 2007. Increases in utility costs and snow removal in our existing base of properties also contributed to the overall increase in rental expenses.

Of the overall $10.1 million increase in real estate taxes in 2008 compared to 2007, $7.0 million was attributable to properties acquired and developments
placed in service from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2008. The remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in tax rates and assessed values on our existing properties.

Service Operations

The following table
sets forth the components of the Service Operations reportable segment (excluding Build-for-Sale Properties) for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):

The decrease in earnings from Service Operations was primarily due to general contractor expenses being higher than usual in
2008 as a result of increases in our total cost estimates for two third-party fixed price construction contracts, which reduced the margins on the contracts.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization increased from $269.7
million in 2007 to $308.1 million in 2008 due to increases in our real estate asset base from acquisitions and developments placed in service during 2007 and 2008 as well as the result of recording additional depreciation expense in the amount of
$13.2 million for properties removed from held-for-sale classification in 2008.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies

Equity in earnings decreased from $29.4 million in 2007 to $23.8 million in 2008 largely as the result of our $7.0 million share of
additional depreciation expense recognized when two properties owned by unconsolidated retail joint ventures were removed from held-for-sale classification. The additional depreciation expense was partially offset by an increase in gain on building
sales in 2008 compared to 2007. During 2007, our joint ventures sold ten non-strategic buildings, with our share of the net gain recognized through equity in earnings totaling $8.0 million, compared to five joint venture building sales in 2008, with
$10.1 million recorded to equity in earnings for our share of the net gains.

Gain on Sale of Properties

Gains on sales of properties increased from $34.7 million in 2007 to $39.1 million in 2008. We sold 15 properties in 2007 compared to 14 properties in 2008.
The properties sold in 2007 and 2008 were part of our Build-for-Sale program, which is no longer a significant part of our Service Operations.

Earnings from Sales of Land

Earnings from sales of land decreased from $34.0 million in 2007 to $12.7 million in 2008. The
decrease in earnings was the result of several significant and high margin land sales during 2007 compared to decreased activity in 2008 as the result of the downturn in the real estate market and in the overall economy.

- 30 -


Impairment Charges

Impairment charges consisted of impairment charges recognized on our long-lived assets as well as the write-off of previously capitalized costs of potential projects that we determined are no longer
likely to be pursued. The increase from $5.7 million in 2007 to $18.5 million in 2008 was largely the result of a re-assessment of our intended use of some of our land holdings, as well as the negative effect of the overall economy on real estate
values in certain of our markets. We recognized non-cash impairment charges in 2008 on seven of our tracts of undeveloped land totaling $8.6 million. Additionally, as the result of the economy’s negative effect on real estate selling prices, we
recognized $2.8 million of impairment charges on two of our properties that were under construction at December 31, 2008, as they were expected to sell in 2009. One of these properties met the criteria for discontinued operations upon sale and
the $1.3 million impairment charge related to this property is accordingly reflected in discontinued operations.

The remaining $8.3 million
and $5.7 million of activity in 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily pertained to costs previously capitalized for potential projects that we later determined would not be pursued.

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased from
$37.7 million in 2007 to $39.5 million in 2008. The increase in general and administrative expenses was largely driven by a $10.9 million decrease in overhead costs allocated to leasing and construction activity based on decreased volume in these
areas. Offsetting the decreased allocation of general and administrative expenses to operating activities was a $9.1 million decrease in total overhead costs in 2008 as we focused on overhead reduction opportunities.

Interest Expense

Interest expense from
continuing operations increased from $175.0 million in 2007 to $198.4 million in 2008. The increase is primarily the result of interest costs related to development projects that were placed in service in late 2007 and 2008 where the costs to
finance these projects were capitalized during construction. Overall, our weighted average interest rates remained fairly consistent from 2007 to 2008, as the weighted average interest rate on our unsecured notes increased from 5.73% to 5.93%, while
we experienced lower interest rates throughout 2008 on our LIBOR-based unsecured lines of credit.

Income Taxes

We recognized an income tax expense of $6.3 million and an income tax benefit of $7.0 million, respectively, in 2007 and 2008. Our taxable REIT subsidiary
recognized taxable losses in 2008, compared to taxable income in 2007, as the result of the timing of land and building sales.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our
estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our Audit Committee and independent
auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:

Accounting for Joint Ventures:

We analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is a variable interest
entity (a “VIE”) and would require consolidation. We (a) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity at risk, (b) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group, and whether
there are any guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (c) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in
making this VIE determination. We would consolidate a venture that is determined to be a VIE if we were the primary beneficiary. Beginning January 1, 2010, a new accounting standard will be effective and will change the method by which the
primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to a primarily qualitative approach whereby the variable interest holder, if any, that controls a VIE’s most significant activities is the primary beneficiary. To the extent that our joint ventures do
not qualify as VIEs, we further assess each partner’s substantive participating rights to determine if the venture should be consolidated.

- 31 -


We have equity interests generally ranging from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and
operate rental properties and hold land for development. To the extent applicable, we consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be VIE’s where we are the primary beneficiary. For non-variable interest entities, we consolidate
those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing entity and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to
manage day-to-day operations, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner. We use the equity method of accounting for those
joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint
ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint
venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis
difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. We recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside
partner’s interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

Cost Capitalization:

Direct and certain
indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with and incremental to the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry.
The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.

We also capitalize direct and
indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and
activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease
capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy. In addition, all leasing commissions paid to third parties
for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized.

- 32 -


In assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a
department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction, development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions and
dispositions and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in
each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.

To ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to
amounts using standards we developed. These standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease. These standards are derived after considering
the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not
capitalized.

Impairment of Real Estate Assets:

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as
held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset
group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows
used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding
the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our
strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset,
or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach
to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to
estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset’s undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of
the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.

To the extent applicable
marketplace data is available, we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired.

Real estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

Acquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets:

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified
intangible assets based on their respective fair values. Beginning January 1, 2009, we record assets acquired in step acquisitions at their full fair value and record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value and the carrying
value of our existing equity interest. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2009, contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.

- 33 -


The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management’s
determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up
periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place
leases, the value of in-place leases and the value of customer relationships.

•

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using an interest
rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would be paid
using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the
balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

•

The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and to customer relationship values, based upon management’s
assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer
relationship, as applicable.

Valuation of Receivables:

We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could
affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform in-house credit reviews and analyses on major existing tenants and all significant prospective tenants before leases are executed. We have established the
following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables and record allowances:

•

We maintain a tenant “watch list” containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at
risk. Various factors such as late rent payments, lease or debt instrument defaults, and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list.

•

As a matter of policy, we reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90 days.

•

Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long-term risk, regardless of the status
of rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

Construction Contracts:

We recognize income on
construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method. Using this method, profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts. A
portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract. To the extent that a fixed-price contract is estimated to result in a loss, the loss is recorded immediately.
Cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract’s term. This revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with
those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes.

With regard to critical accounting policies, management has discussed the
following with the Audit Committee:

•

Criteria for identifying and selecting our critical accounting policies;

•

Methodology in applying our critical accounting policies; and

•

Impact of the critical accounting policies on our financial statements.

The Audit Committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

As the result of generating capital in excess of $1.6 billion
through a common equity issuance, secured and unsecured borrowings, and property dispositions, we have repaid the entire balance on DRLP’s unsecured line of credit and created capacity, through cash and availability on the line, to meet our
short-term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months.

We expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage
and unsecured debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and other non-recurring capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow and accessing the public debt and equity
markets.

Rental Operations

We believe our primary source of liquidity, cash flows from Rental Operations, provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition
(except for periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue
recognition.

We are subject to a number of risks as a result of current economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and
bankruptcies, and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, each of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations. In 2009, we recognized $12.0 million of expense related to reserving doubtful
receivables, including reserves on straight-line rent, compared to $5.2 million in 2008.

Unsecured Debt and Equity Securities

Our unsecured lines of credit as of December 31, 2009 are described as follows (in thousands):

On November 20, 2009, the
Company and DRLP renewed its unsecured line of credit. Under terms of the renewal, the DRLP unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of $850.0 million with an interest rate on borrowings of 275 basis points over the applicable LIBOR rate,
and matures in February 2013. Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, for a total of up to $1.05 billion. This line of credit provides us with an option to
obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line, at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage and debt-to-asset
value (with asset value being defined in the DRLP unsecured line of credit agreement). As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

In April 2009, we received $551.4 million of net proceeds from the issuance of approximately 75.2 million shares of common stock. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding
borrowings under the DRLP unsecured revolving line of credit as well as for general corporate purposes.

- 35 -


In August 2009, we issued $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes in two equal tranches. The first $250.0
million of the senior unsecured notes mature in February 2015 and bear interest at an effective rate of 7.50%, while the other $250.0 million of the senior unsecured notes mature in August 2019 and bear interest at an effective rate of 8.38%. The
net proceeds from the issuance were primarily used to repurchase outstanding unsecured notes, both on the open market and through cash tender offers, maturing through December 2011.

The indentures (and related supplemental indentures) governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in
compliance with all such covenants, as well as applicable covenants under our unsecured line of credit, as of December 31, 2009.

At
December 31, 2009, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of DRLP’s debt securities (including guarantees thereof)
and the Company’s common shares, preferred shares, depository shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and units comprised of one or more of these securities. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic
shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long-term debt upon maturity.

Sale of Real Estate
Assets

We pursue opportunities to sell non-strategic real estate assets in order to generate additional liquidity. Our ability to
dispose of such properties is dependent on the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. In light of recent market and economic conditions, including, without limitation, the
availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, and condition of the equity and real estate markets, we may be unable to dispose of such properties quickly, or on favorable terms.

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities

Transactions with unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity. From time to time we will sell properties to an unconsolidated entity, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive
proceeds commensurate to the interest that we do not own. Additionally, unconsolidated entities will from time to time obtain debt financing and will distribute to us, and our partners, all or a portion of the proceeds.

We have a 20% equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that may acquire up to $800.0 million of our newly developed build-to-suit projects over a
three-year period from its formation in May 2008. Properties are sold to the joint venture upon completion, lease commencement and satisfaction of other customary conditions. We received net sale and financing proceeds of approximately $251.6
million, during the year ended December 31, 2008, related to the joint venture’s acquisition of seven of our properties. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the joint venture acquired five additional properties from us and we
received net sale proceeds, commensurate to our partner’s ownership interest, of approximately $82.5 million.

Uses of Liquidity

Our principal uses of liquidity include the following:

•

accretive property investment;

•

recurring leasing/capital costs;

•

dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;

•

long-term debt maturities;

•

opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt; and

•

other contractual obligations.

- 36 -


Property Investment

We evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon our continued
access to our longer-term sources of liquidity including the issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties. In light of current economic conditions, management continues to evaluate our
investment priorities and is focused on accretive growth.

We have continued to operate at a substantially reduced level of new development
activity, as compared to recent years, and are focused on the core operations of our existing base of properties.

Recurring
Expenditures

One of our principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the recurring leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate
investments. The following is a summary of our recurring capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):

Dividends and Distributions

We are required to meet the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), in order to maintain our REIT
status. Because depreciation and impairments are non-cash expenses, cash flow will typically be greater than operating income. We paid dividends per share of $0.76, $1.93 and $1.91 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. We expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings, to meet the requirements to maintain our REIT status, and additional amounts as determined by our board of directors. Distributions are declared at
the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.

At December 31, 2009 we had six series of preferred shares outstanding. The annual dividend rates on our preferred shares range between 6.5% and 8.375%
and are paid in arrears quarterly.

Debt Maturities

Debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 had a face value totaling $3.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 6.36% maturing at various dates through 2028. We had $3.1 billion of unsecured
debt, $15.8 million outstanding on a consolidated subsidiary’s unsecured line of credit and $784.7 million of secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2009. We made scheduled and unscheduled principal payments of $1.2 billion on
outstanding debt (including repurchases of outstanding debt discussed below) during the year ended December 31, 2009.

The following is a
summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at December 31, 2009 (in thousands, except percentage data):

- 37 -


We anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from
rental operations and property dispositions, as well as by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions.

Repurchases of Outstanding Debt

During 2009, through a cash tender offer as well as open market transactions, we paid
$500.9 million to repurchase outstanding unsecured notes with a face value of $542.9 million. We expect to use a portion of the cash we have on hand at December 31, 2009 to repay unsecured notes maturing in 2010.

Guarantee Obligations

We are
subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments.

We are, however, subject to a joint and several guarantee of the construction loan agreement of the 3630 Peachtree joint venture. A contingent liability in the amount of $36.3 million was established
in 2009 based on the probability of us being required to pay this obligation to the lender.

Historical Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents were $147.3 million and $22.5 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following highlights significant
changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in millions):

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our Rental Operations and Service
Operations activities. The receipt of rental income from Rental Operations continues to provide the primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows. In addition, we have historically developed Build-for-Sale properties with the intent to
sell them at or soon after completion. As part of a refinement to our strategy, we have ceased new Build-for-Sale development activity to focus on completion of existing projects. Highlights of operating cash changes are as follows:

•

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred Build-for-Sale property development costs of $16.9 million, compared to $216.1 million and
$281.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease is a result of the planned elimination of our Build-for-Sale program.

•

We sold three Build-for-Sale properties in 2009 compared to 14 in 2008 and 15 in 2007, receiving net proceeds of $31.9 million, $343.0 million and
$232.6 million, respectively. The 2009 sales were nearly break-even, while the 2008 and 2007 sales resulted in pre-tax gains of $39.1 million and $34.7 million, respectively.

•

Net cash flows from third-party construction contracts totaled a net outflow of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to a
net inflow of $125.9 million and a net outflow of $25.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in 2008 was largely driven by $105.1 million in cash proceeds from the 2008 sale of a parcel of land that
was completed in conjunction with a significant third-party construction project.

- 38 -


Investing Activities

Investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity. Development and acquisition activities typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements.
Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:

•

Development expenditures for our held-for-rental portfolio totaled $268.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $436.3 million
and $451.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease is in line with our planned reduction in new development activity.

•

During 2009, we paid cash of $31.7 million for real estate acquisitions, compared to $20.1 million in 2008 and $117.4 million in 2007. In addition, we
paid cash of $5.5 million for undeveloped land in 2009, compared to $40.9 million in 2008 and $317.3 million in 2007. The cash paid for real estate acquisitions in 2007 included $55.4 million for a portfolio of industrial properties located in
Seattle, Virginia and Houston.

•

Sales of land and depreciated property provided $256.3 million in net proceeds in 2009, compared to $116.6 million in 2008 and $480.9 million in 2007.
We sold portfolios of eight suburban office properties in our Cleveland market and twelve industrial properties in our St. Louis market during 2007, which together provided $203.5 million of the net proceeds received in 2007.

•

During 2009, we contributed or advanced $23.5 million to fund development activities within unconsolidated companies, compared to $132.2 million in
2008 and $142.3 million in 2007. The decrease was largely as the result of a planned reduction in new development.

•

We received capital distributions (as a result of the sale of properties or refinancing) from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $95.4 million in 2008 and
$235.8 million in 2007. We received no such distributions from unconsolidated companies in 2009.

Financing Activities

The following items highlight significant capital transactions:

•

In order to retain additional cash to help meet our capital needs, we reduced our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2009. We paid
cash dividends of $0.76 per common share in 2009, compared to cash dividends of $1.93 per common share in 2008 and $1.91 per common share in 2007.

•

In November 2009, we repaid $82.1 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 7.86% on their scheduled maturity date. In
February 2009, we repaid $124.0 million of corporate unsecured debt with an effective interest rate of 6.83% on its scheduled maturity date. This compares to repayments of $125.0 million and $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes with effective
interest rates of 3.36% and 6.76% on their scheduled maturity dates in January 2008 and May 2008, respectively. We also repaid $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 7.47% on their scheduled maturity date in
August 2007 and $100.0 million of corporate unsecured debt with an effective interest rate of 3.63% on their scheduled maturity date in November 2007.

•

We decreased net borrowings on DRLP’s $850.0 million line of credit by $474.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, completely
repaying the outstanding balance, compared to a decrease of $69.0 million in 2008 and an increase of $226.0 million in 2007.

•

In August 2009, we issued $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2015 bearing interest at an effective rate of 7.50% and $250.0 million of
senior unsecured notes due in 2019 bearing interest at an effective rate of 8.38%. This compares to issuances of senior unsecured notes in May 2008 and September 2007, respectively, of $325.0 million with an effective interest rate of 7.36% due in
2013 and $300.0 million with an effective interest rate of 6.16% due in 2018.

•

Throughout 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes maturing in 2009 through 2011. In
2009, cash payments of $500.9 million were made to repurchase notes with a face value of $542.9 million, compared to cash payments of $36.5 million made in the fourth quarter of 2008 for notes with a face value of $38.5 million.

- 39 -


•

In February, March and July 2009, we received cash proceeds of $270.0 million from three 10-year secured debt financings that are secured by 32 rental
properties. The secured debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.69% and matures at various points in 2019.

•

In April 2009, we issued 75.2 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $551.4 million. The proceeds from this offering were contributed
to DRLP in exchange for additional units in DRLP and were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the DRLP unsecured revolving line of credit and for other general corporate purposes. We had no common stock issuances in 2008, but we issued
7.0 million shares of our common stock in October 2007 for net proceeds of $232.7 million.

•

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we opportunistically repurchased a portion of all outstanding series of preferred shares in the open market in order
to take advantage of the significant discounts at which they were trading. In total, we repurchased preferred shares having a redemption value of approximately $27.4 million for $12.4 million, which resulted in an approximate $14.0 million gain on
repurchase after considering the charge-off of offering costs from those shares.

•

In March 2008, we settled three forward-starting swaps and made a cash payment of $14.6 million to the counterparties.

•

In February 2008, we received net proceeds of approximately $290.0 million from the issuance of shares of our Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock; we had no new preferred equity issuances in 2009.

•

In October 2007, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our 7.990% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at the liquidation amount of
$132.3 million.

Credit Ratings

We are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group. Our senior unsecured notes
have been assigned ratings of BBB- and Baa2 by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s Investors Service, respectively.

Our
preferred shares carry ratings of BB+ and Baa3 from Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s Investors Service, respectively.

The ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred shares could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to
capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in Unconsolidated Companies

We have equity interests generally ranging from
10% to 50% in unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. Our unconsolidated subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the operations and development of Industrial, Office and
Medical Office real estate properties. We hold interests both in joint ventures that operate real estate for long-term investment and rental income (“Operating Joint Ventures”) as well as joint ventures that develop properties with the
intent to sell within a relatively short period of time after completion and lease-up (“Development Joint Ventures”). The equity method of accounting (see Critical Accounting Policies) is used for these investments in which we have the
ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies. As a result, the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet. Total assets of our unconsolidated subsidiaries
were $2.6 billion as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008.

- 40 -


Our investments in and advances to unconsolidated companies represent approximately 7% and 9% of our total
assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These investments provide several benefits to us, including increased market share, tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects.

The following table presents summarized financial information for unconsolidated companies for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (“special purpose
entities”) that have been established solely for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual
Obligations

At December 31, 2009, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below:

(1)

Our long-term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using
the interest rates as of December 31, 2009.

(2)

Our unsecured lines of credit consist of an operating line of credit that matures February 2013 and the line of credit of a consolidated subsidiary that matures July
2011. Interest expense for our unsecured lines of credit was calculated using the most recent stated interest rates that were in effect.

(3)

Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at
December 31, 2009.

(4)

Represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of owned development projects and third-party construction projects.

(5)

Represents other contractual obligations.

- 41 -


Related Party Transactions

We provide property management, leasing, construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively, we earned management fees of $8.4 million, $7.8 million and $7.1 million, leasing fees of $4.2 million, $2.8 million and $4.2 million and construction and development fees of $10.2 million, $12.7 million and $13.1 million from
these companies. We recorded these fees based on contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services, and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

We
have guaranteed the repayment of $82.1 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that
incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

We also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of eight of our unconsolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, the maximum
guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately $346.9 million. With the exception of the guarantee of the debt of 3630 Peachtree joint venture, for which we have recorded a contingent liability, management believes that the value of the
underlying real estate exceeds the associated loan balances and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees.

In October 2000, we
sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair value of $487.0 million to a joint venture (Dugan Realty LLC) in which we have a 50% interest and recognized a net gain of $35.2 million. In connection with this transaction,
the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to a $50.0 million interest in the joint venture to us in exchange for our common stock or cash (at our option), subject to certain timing and other restrictions. As a result of this put
option, we deferred $10.2 million of gain on sale of depreciated property and recorded a $50.0 million liability.

We lease certain land
positions with terms extending to May 2070, with a total obligation of $84.4 million. No payments on these ground leases are material in any individual year.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will
not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2009, we adopted a newly effective accounting standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in
cash upon conversion. The new standard requires separate accounting for the debt and equity components of certain convertible instruments. Our Exchangeable Notes issued in November 2006 have an exchange rate of 20.47 common shares per $1,000
principal amount of the notes, representing an exchange price of $48.85 per share of our common stock. The Exchangeable Notes were subject to the accounting changes required by the new standard, which required that the value assigned to the debt
component equal the estimated fair value of debt with similar contractual cash flows, but without the conversion feature, resulting in the debt being recorded at a discount. The resulting debt discount will be amortized over the period from its
issuance through November 2011, the first optional redemption date, as additional non-cash interest expense.

- 42 -


At December 31, 2009, the Exchangeable Notes had $235.4 million of principal outstanding, an
unamortized discount of $6.0 million and a net carrying amount of $229.4 million. The carrying amount of the equity component was $34.7 million at December 31, 2009. Subsequent to the implementation of the new standard, interest expense is
recognized on the Exchangeable Notes at an effective rate of 5.6%. The increase to interest expense (in thousands) on the Exchangeable Notes, which led to a corresponding decrease to net income, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007 is summarized as follows:

In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that will be
effective on January 1, 2010. This accounting standard is a revision to a previous FASB interpretation and changes how a reporting entity evaluates whether an entity is a VIE and which entity is considered the primary beneficiary of a VIE and
is therefore required to consolidate such VIE. This accounting standard will also require assessments at each reporting period of which party within the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and will require a number of new disclosures related
to VIE’s. We do not anticipate this new accounting standard to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long-term borrowings. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on
earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed rates. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. Our two outstanding swaps, that
fixed the rates on two of our variable rate loans, were not significant to the Financial Statements in terms of notional amount or fair value at December 31, 2009.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts (in thousands) of the expected annual maturities, weighted average interest rates for the
average debt outstanding in the specified period, fair values (in thousands) and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.

As the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2009, it does not consider those
exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time to the
extent we are party to interest rate derivatives, and interest rates. Interest expense on our unsecured lines of credit will be affected by fluctuations in LIBOR indices as well as changes in our credit rating.

- 43 -


At December 31, 2009 the redemption value of our unsecured notes was $3.1 billion and we estimated the
fair value of those unsecured notes to be $3.0 billion, whereas at December 31, 2008 the redemption value of our unsecured notes was $3.3 billion and our estimate of the fair value was $2.2 billion. Our unsecured notes are thinly traded and our
estimate of the fair value of those notes, when compared to their redemption value, has increased significantly since December 31, 2008 largely as the result of recent comparable trades being completed at significantly lower, or no, discounts.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The financial statements and supplementary data are included under Item 15 of this Report.

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

There was no change or disagreement with our accountants related to our accounting and financial disclosures.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as of the end of the period covered by this Report. The controls
evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.

Attached as exhibits to this Report are certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This Controls and Procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics
presented.

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”) are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on the disclosure
controls and procedures evaluation referenced above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting and the audit report of our registered public accounting firm are included
in Item 15 of Part IV under the headings “Management’s Report on Internal Control” and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,” respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009, that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control

We, as management of Duke Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Duke”), are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the
company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control – Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.

The independent registered public accounting firm of KPMG LLP, as auditors of Duke’s consolidated financial statements, has also issued an audit report on Duke’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Shareholders and Directors of

Duke Realty
Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. In connection with our
audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule III. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s report on internal
control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits
of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009,
in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule III, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, Duke Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The Company

Substantially all of our Rental Operations (see Note 9) are conducted through Duke Realty Limited Partnership (“DRLP”). We owned approximately 97.1% of the common partnership interests of DRLP (“Units”) at
December 31, 2009. At the option of the holders, subject to certain restrictions, the remaining Units are redeemable for shares of our common stock on a one-to-one basis and earn dividends at the same rate as shares of our common stock. If
determined to be necessary in order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we may elect to purchase the Units for an equivalent amount of cash rather than issuing shares of common stock upon redemption. We conduct our Service Operations (see Note 9)
through Duke Realty Services LLC and Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner and of which DRLP is the sole limited partner. We also conduct Service Operations through Duke Construction Limited Partnership,
which is owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary and is effectively 100% owned by DRLP. The terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Duke Realty Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) and those entities owned
or controlled by the Company.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

FASB Codification

On July 1, 2009, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC” or the “Codification”) that establishes the exclusive authoritative reference for accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“GAAP”) for use in financial statements, except for SEC rules and interpretive releases, which are also authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting
standards but did not impact any of our existing accounting policies.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. The equity
interests in these controlled subsidiaries not owned by us are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements. Investments in entities that we do not control through majority voting interest or where the other owner has substantial participating rights are not consolidated and are reflected as investments in unconsolidated companies under the
equity method of reporting.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for 2008 and 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the 2009
consolidated financial statement presentation.

Real Estate Investments

Rental real property, including land, land improvements, buildings and tenant improvements, are included in real estate investments and are
generally stated at cost. Construction in process and undeveloped land are included in real estate investments and are stated at cost. Real estate investments also include our equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate
rental properties and hold land for development.

- 61 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Depreciation

Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on the
straight-line method over their estimated life not to exceed 40 and 15 years, respectively, and tenant improvement costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the term of the related lease.

Cost Capitalization

Direct and certain indirect costs clearly associated with and incremental to the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. In
addition, all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized. We capitalize a portion of our indirect costs associated with our construction, development and leasing efforts. In assessing the amount of
direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. We do not capitalize any costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects.

We capitalize direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In addition, we capitalize costs, including real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities, that have been allocated to vacant space based on the square footage of the portion of the building not
held available for immediate occupancy during the extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to
ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized.

We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods when significant activities have ceased, which does not exceed the
shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.

Impairment

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as
held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset
group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows
used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding
the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our
strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset,
or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

- 62 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective,
especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing
long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash
flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset’s undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.

Real estate assets classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs
to sell. Once a property is designated as held-for-sale, no further depreciation expense is recorded.

Purchase Accounting

On January 1, 2009, we adopted the new accounting standard (ASC 805) on purchase accounting, which requires
acquisition related costs to be expensed immediately as period costs. This new standard also requires that (i) 100% of the assets and liabilities of an acquired entity, as opposed to the amount proportional to the portion acquired, must be
recorded at fair value upon an acquisition and (ii) a gain or loss must be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of any existing ownership interests in acquired entities. Finally, this new standard requires
that contingencies arising from a business combination be recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, based on all pertinent information available and adjusted
based on changes in that information in no event to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management’s determination of the value of the property
as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market
conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place
leases and the value of customer relationships.

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired
in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its
remaining term and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in
the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and to customer relationship values based upon
management’s assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the
customer relationship, as applicable.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Joint Ventures

We analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity (a “VIE”)
and would require consolidation. We (a) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity investment at risk, (b) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group, and whether there are any
guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (c) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this VIE
determination. We would consolidate a venture that is determined to be a VIE if we were the primary beneficiary. To the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities, we further assess each partner’s substantive
participating rights to determine if the venture should be consolidated.

In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting
standard that will be effective on January 1, 2010. This accounting standard is a revision to a previous FASB interpretation and changes how a reporting entity evaluates whether an entity is a VIE and which entity is considered the primary
beneficiary of a VIE and is therefore required to consolidate such VIE. This accounting standard will also require assessments at each reporting period of which party within the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and will require a number of
new disclosures related to VIE’s. We do not anticipate this new accounting standard to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption.

We have equity interests generally ranging from 10% to 50% in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold
land for development. We consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. For non-variable interest entities, we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through
majority ownership interests or where we are the managing member and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day-to-day operations, refinance debt
and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner. We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control
over operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not
included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint
venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of
the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. We recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner’s interest, to the extent the
economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

Cash Equivalents

Investments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Valuation of Receivables

We reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight-line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90 days. Additional reserves are recorded for more current amounts, as applicable,
where we have determined collectability to be doubtful. Straight-line rent receivables for any tenant with long-term risk, regardless of the status of rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary.

- 64 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Deferred Costs

Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related loan. All direct and
indirect costs, including estimated internal costs, associated with the leasing of real estate investments owned by us are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease. We include lease incentive costs, which are payments made on
behalf of a tenant to sign a lease, in deferred leasing costs and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms as a reduction of rental revenues. We include as lease incentives amounts funded to construct tenant
improvements owned by the tenant. Unamortized costs are charged to expense upon the early termination of the lease or upon early payment of the financing.

Convertible Debt Accounting

On January 1, 2009, we adopted a
new accounting standard (FASB ASC 470) for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion. This new standard requires separate accounting for the debt and equity components of certain convertible instruments. Our 3.75%
Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Exchangeable Notes”), issued in November 2006, have an exchange rate of 20.47 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, representing an exchange price of $48.85 per share of our common stock. The
Exchangeable Notes were subject to the accounting changes required by this new standard, which required that the value assigned to the debt component equal the estimated fair value of debt with similar contractual cash flows, but without the
conversion feature, resulting in the debt being recorded at a discount. The resulting debt discount will be amortized over the period from its issuance through November 2011, the first optional redemption date, as additional non-cash interest
expense. We were required to apply this new accounting standard retrospectively to prior periods.

At December 31, 2009,
the Exchangeable Notes had $235.4 million of principal outstanding, an unamortized discount of $6.0 million and a net carrying amount of $229.4 million. The carrying amount of the equity component was $34.7 million at December 31, 2009.
Subsequent to the implementation of the new standard, interest expense is recognized on the Exchangeable Notes at an effective rate of 5.6%. The increase to interest expense (in thousands) on the Exchangeable Notes, which led to a corresponding
decrease to net income, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is summarized as follows:

Noncontrolling Interests

On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard (FASB ASC 810) on noncontrolling interests, which required noncontrolling
interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of total equity, resulting in retroactive changes to the presentation of the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of
operations. This new standard also modified the accounting for changes in the level of ownership in consolidated subsidiaries.

- 65 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Noncontrolling interests relate to the minority ownership interests in DRLP and
interests in consolidated property partnerships that are not wholly owned. Noncontrolling interests are subsequently adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to noncontrolling holders and the noncontrolling holders’ proportionate
share of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity.

Prior to January 1, 2009, when a Unit was redeemed (Note
1), the difference between the aggregate book value and the purchase price of the Unit increased the recorded value of our net assets. For redemptions of Units subsequent to January 1, 2009, the change in ownership is treated as an equity
transaction and there is no effect on our earnings or net assets.

Revenue Recognition

Rental and Related Revenue

The timing of revenue recognition under an operating lease is determined based upon ownership of the tenant improvements. If we are the owner of the tenant improvements, revenue recognition commences
after the improvements are completed and the tenant takes possession or control of the space. In contrast, if we determine that the tenant allowances we are funding are lease incentives, then we commence revenue recognition when possession or
control of the space is turned over to the tenant. Rental income from leases with free rental periods or scheduled rental increases during their terms is recognized on a straight-line basis.

We record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination
fee is not subject to any material conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us.

General Contractor
and Service Fee Revenue

Management fees are based on a percentage of rental receipts of properties managed and are
recognized as the rental receipts are collected. Maintenance fees are based upon established hourly rates and are recognized as the services are performed. Construction management and development fees represent fee-based third-party contracts and
are recognized as earned based on the terms of the contract, which approximates the percentage of completion method.

We
recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method. Using this method, profits are recorded based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts,
commencing when the work performed under the contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the
estimated final costs. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

Property Sales

Gains on sales of all properties are recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 360-20.

The specific timing of the sale of a building is
measured against various criteria in FASB ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance from the seller associated with the properties. We make judgments based on
the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize considering factors such as continuing ownership interest we may have with the buyer (“partial sales”) and our level of
future involvement with the property or the buyer that acquires the assets. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery
methods, as appropriate, until the full accrual sales criteria are met. Estimated future costs to be incurred after completion of each sale are included in the determination of the gain on sales.

To the extent that a property has had operations prior to sale, and that we do not have continuing involvement with the property, gains from
sales of depreciated property are included in discontinued operations and the proceeds from the sale of these held-for-rental properties are classified in the investing activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Gains or losses from our sale of properties that were developed or repositioned with the intent to sell and not for long-term rental
(“Build-for-Sale” properties) are classified as gain on sale of properties in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Other rental properties that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations are also classified
as gain on sale of properties in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share

Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, less
dividends on share-based awards expected to vest, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the sum of basic net income (loss) attributable to
common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in earnings allocable to Units not owned by us (to the extent the Units are dilutive), by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, to the extent they are dilutive,
limited partnership Units outstanding, as well as any potential dilutive securities for the period.

During the first quarter
of 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard (FASB ASC 260-10) on participating securities, which we have applied retrospectively to prior period calculations of basic and diluted earnings per common share. Pursuant to this new standard, certain of
our share-based awards are considered participating securities because they earn dividend equivalents that are not forfeited even if the underlying award does not vest.

Federal Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To
qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our adjusted taxable income to our stockholders. Management intends to continue to adhere to these
requirements and to maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we are entitled to a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends we pay to shareholders. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we distribute an
amount equal to or in excess of our taxable income currently to shareholders. We are also generally subject to federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any
taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.

REIT qualification reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of state and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a dividends paid
deduction and are subject to corporate federal, state and local income taxes. As a REIT, we may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes if we engage in certain types of transactions.

The following table reconciles our net income (loss) to taxable income (loss) before the dividends paid deduction for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Our dividends paid deduction is summarized below (in thousands):

A summary of the tax characterization of the dividends
paid for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 follows:

Refinements to our operating strategy in 2009 caused us to reduce our projections of taxable income in our
taxable REIT subsidiary. As the result of these changes in our projections, we determined that it was more likely than not that the taxable REIT subsidiary would not generate sufficient taxable income to realize any of its deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, we recognized a $12.3 million charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of 2009 in order to establish a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. Changes to federal income tax legislation in the fourth quarter of
2009, which extended the period that net operating losses may be carried back from two to five years, resulted in the reversal of approximately $5.0 million of the valuation allowance that was initially established. Income taxes, with the exception
of this non-recurring charge, are not material to our operating results or financial position.

We paid federal and state
income taxes of $800,000, $3.5 million and $10.1 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The taxable REIT subsidiaries have no significant net deferred income tax or unrecognized tax benefit items.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We periodically enter into certain interest rate protection agreements to effectively convert or cap floating rate debt to a fixed rate, and to hedge anticipated future financing transactions, both of
which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. Net amounts paid or received under these agreements are recognized as an adjustment to the interest expense of the corresponding debt. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.

If a derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative
is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective, while the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value is recognized in earnings. Gains and losses on our interest rate protection agreements are
subsequently included in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same periods in which the related interest payments being hedged are recognized in earnings.

- 69 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We estimate the fair value of derivative instruments using standard market conventions
and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and termination cost at each balance sheet date. For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk-management objective and strategy
for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a
description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.

Fair Value Measurements

On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard (ASC 820) that establishes a framework for measuring fair value of
non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis but only in certain circumstances, such as a business combination.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation
techniques as follows:

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities to which we have access.

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted
prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.

Level 3 inputs are
unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair
value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment
and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The most significant estimates, as discussed within
our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, pertain to the critical assumptions utilized in testing real estate assets for impairment as well as in estimating the fair value of real estate assets when an impairment event has taken place. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Significant Acquisitions and Dispositions

Consolidation of Retail Joint Ventures

Through March 31, 2009, we
were a member in two retail real estate joint ventures with a retail developer. Both entities were jointly controlled by us and our partner, through equal voting interests, and were accounted for as unconsolidated subsidiaries under the equity
method. As of April 1, 2009, we had made combined equity contributions of $37.9 million to the two entities and we also had combined outstanding principal and accrued interest of $173.0 million on advances to the two entities.

We advanced $2.0 million to the two entities, who then distributed the $2.0 million to our partner in exchange for the redemption of our
partner’s membership interests, effective April 1, 2009, at which time we obtained 100% control of the voting interests of both entities. We entered these transactions to gain control of these two entities because it will allow us to
operate or dispose of the entities in a manner that best serves our capital needs.

In conjunction with the redemption of our
partner’s membership interests, we entered a profits interest agreement that entitles our former partner to additional payments should the combined sale of the two acquired entities, as well as the sale of another retail real estate joint
venture that we and our partner still jointly control, result in an aggregate profit. Aggregate profit on the sale of these three projects will be calculated by using a formula defined in the profits interest agreement. We have estimated that the
fair value of the potential additional payment to our partner is insignificant.

A summary of the fair value of amounts
recognized for each major class of assets and liabilities acquired is as follows (in thousands):

The fair values recognized from the real estate and
related assets acquired were primarily determined using the income approach. The most significant assumptions in the fair value estimates were the discount rates and the exit capitalization rates. The estimates of fair value were determined to have
primarily relied upon Level 3 inputs.

We recognized a loss of $1.1 million upon acquisition, which represents the difference
between the fair value of the recognized assets and the carrying value of our pre-existing equity interest. The acquisition date fair value of the net recognized assets as compared to the acquisition date carrying value of our outstanding advances
and accrued interest, as well as the acquisition date carrying value of our pre-existing equity interests, is shown as follows (in thousands):

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Since April 1, 2009, the results of operations for both acquired entities have been
included in continuing operations in our consolidated financial statements. Due to our significant pre-existing ownership and financing positions in the two acquired entities, the inclusion of their results of operations did not have a material
effect on our operating income.

Acquisitions

We acquired income producing real estate related assets of $32.1 million, $60.5 million and $219.9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

In December 2007, in order to further establish our property positions around strategic port locations, we
purchased a portfolio of five industrial buildings in Seattle, Virginia and Houston, as well as approximately 161 acres of undeveloped land and a 12-acre container storage facility in Houston. The total price was $89.7 million and was financed in
part through assumption of secured debt that had a fair value of $34.3 million. Of the total purchase price, $64.1 million was allocated to in-service real estate assets, $20.0 million was allocated to undeveloped land and the container storage
facility, $5.4 million was allocated to lease related intangible assets, and the remaining amount was allocated to acquired working capital related assets and liabilities. The results of operations for the acquired properties since the date of
acquisition have been included in continuing rental operations in our consolidated financial statements.

All other
acquisitions were not individually material.

Dispositions

We disposed of income producing real estate related assets with gross proceeds of $267.0 million, $426.2 million and $590.4 million in 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

We sold five properties in 2009 and seven properties in 2008 to an unconsolidated joint venture.
The gross proceeds totaled $84.3 million and $226.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In March 2007, as part of our capital recycling program, we sold a portfolio of eight suburban office properties totaling 894,000 square feet in the Cleveland market. The sales price totaled $140.4 million, of which we received net proceeds
of $139.3 million. We also sold a portfolio of twelve flex and light industrial properties in July 2007, totaling 865,000 square feet in the St. Louis market, for a sales price of $65.0 million, of which we received net proceeds of $64.2 million.

All other dispositions were not individually material.

Related Party Transactions

We provide property management, leasing, construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively, we earned management fees of $8.4 million, $7.8 million and $7.1 million, leasing fees of $4.2 million, $2.8 million and $4.2 million and construction and development fees of $10.2 million, $12.7 million and $13.1 million from
these companies. We recorded these fees based on contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services, and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements.

We allocate interest
expense to discontinued operations and have included such interest expense in computing income from discontinued operations. Interest expense allocable to discontinued operations includes interest on any secured debt for properties included in
discontinued operations and an allocable share of our consolidated unsecured interest expense for unencumbered properties. The allocation of unsecured interest expense to discontinued operations was based upon the gross book value of the
unencumbered real estate assets included in discontinued operations as it related to the total gross book value of our unencumbered real estate assets.

Impairments and Other Charges

The following table illustrates impairment and other charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands):

Land and Buildings

During 2009, we refined our operating strategy and one result of this change in strategy was the decision to dispose of approximately 1,800
acres of land, which had a total cost basis of $385.3 million, rather than holding them for future development. Our change in strategy for this land triggered the requirement to conduct an impairment analysis, which resulted in a determination that
a significant portion of the land was impaired. We recognized impairment charges on land of $136.6 million in 2009, primarily as the result of writing down the land that was identified for disposition, and determined to be impaired, to fair
value. We utilized a market approach to determine fair value and, to the extent current comparable sales values were unavailable, made adjustments to historical comparable sales based on the Company’s understanding of current market conditions
and the experience of our management team. Actual sales of our undeveloped land targeted for disposition could be at prices that differ significantly from our estimates and additional impairments may be necessary in the future in the event
market conditions deteriorate further. Our valuation estimates primarily relied upon Level 3 inputs, as previously defined.

- 74 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

During 2009, we also reviewed our existing portfolio of buildings and determined that
several buildings, which had previously not been actively marketed for disposal, were not strategic and would not be held as long-term investments. Additionally, at various times throughout the year, we determined it appropriate to re-evaluate
certain other buildings that were in various stages of the disposition process for impairment because new information was available that triggered further analysis. Impairment charges of $78.1 million were recognized for 28 office, industrial and
retail buildings that were determined to be impaired, either as the result of a refinement in management’s strategy or changes in market conditions. In calculating the impairment charges for the aforementioned 28 buildings, we determined fair
value using either the income approach or the market approach. The most significant assumptions, when using the income approach, included the discount rate as well as future exit capitalization rates, occupancy levels, rental rates and capital
expenditures. Fair value measurements for the buildings that were determined to be impaired relied primarily upon Level 3 inputs, as defined earlier in this report.

Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

We have an investment in an
unconsolidated entity (the “3630 Peachtree joint venture”) whose sole activity is the development and operation of the office component of a multi-use office and residential high-rise building located in the Buckhead sub-market of Atlanta.
The building is currently in the final stages of development. As the result of declines in rental rates and projected increases in capital costs, we analyzed our investment during the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 and recognized
an impairment charge to write off our $14.4 million investment, as we determined that an other-than-temporary decline in value had taken place. As a result of the joint venture’s obligations to the lender in its construction loan agreement, the
likelihood that our partner will be unable to contribute their share of the additional equity to fund the joint venture’s future capital costs, and ultimately the obligation stemming from our joint and several guarantee of the joint venture
loan, we recorded an additional liability of $36.3 million, and an equal charge to impairment expense, for our probable future obligations to the lender. The estimates of fair value utilized in determining the aforementioned charges relied primarily
on Level 3 inputs, as defined earlier in this report.

Due to credit issues with its most significant tenant, an inability to
renew third-party financing on acceptable terms and an increase to its projected capital expenditures, we analyzed an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (the “Park Creek joint venture”) during the three-month period ended
June 30, 2009 to determine whether there was an other-than-temporary decline in value. As a result of that analysis, we determined that an other-than-temporary decline in value had taken place and wrote our investment in the Park Creek joint
venture down to its fair value, thus recognizing a $5.8 million impairment charge. We estimated the fair value of the Park Creek joint venture using the income approach and the most significant assumption in the estimate was the expected period of
time in which we would hold our investment in the joint venture. We concluded that the estimate of fair value relied primarily upon Level 3 inputs, as defined earlier in this report.

Other Real Estate Related Assets

We recognized $32.5 million of impairment charges on other real estate related assets during 2009. The impairment charges related primarily to reserving loans receivable from other real estate entities as
well as writing off previously deferred development costs.

Indebtedness

Indebtedness at December 31, 2009 and 2008 consists of the following (in thousands):

Fixed Rate Secured Debt

As of December 31, 2009, the $785.8 million of secured debt was collateralized by rental properties with a carrying value of $1.4
billion and by letters of credit in the amount of $7.7 million.

In February, March and July 2009, we borrowed a total of
$270.0 million from three 10-year fixed rate secured debt financings that are secured by 32 rental properties. The secured debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.69% and matures at various points in 2019. Additionally, in June 2009, we
borrowed $8.5 million from two 6.50% 10-year fixed rate mortgages due in 2019, which are secured by two newly acquired properties. One of our consolidated subsidiaries also borrowed $11.9 million, bearing interest at a variable rate (equal to 5.0%
as of December 31, 2009) and maturing in April 2012, on a secured construction loan during 2009.

The fair value of our
fixed rate secured debt as of December 31, 2009 was $770.3 million. We utilized a discounted cash flow methodology in order to determine the fair value of our fixed rate secured debt. The net present value of the difference between future
contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate represents the difference between the book value and the fair value. Our estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate at which we
estimate we could obtain similar borrowings when considering current market conditions. The current market rates we utilized were internally estimated; therefore, we have concluded that our determination of fair value for our fixed rate secured debt
was primarily based upon Level 3 (as described in Note 2) inputs.

Fixed Rate Unsecured Debt

We took the following actions during 2009 and 2008 as it pertains to our fixed rate unsecured indebtedness:

•

In February 2009, we repaid $124.0 million of 6.83% corporate unsecured debt at its scheduled maturity date.

•

Throughout 2009, we repurchased portions of various series of senior unsecured notes with various scheduled maturity dates through December 2011, both
on the open market and through cash tender offers, for $500.9 million. The total face value of these repurchases was $542.9 million. We recognized a gain of $27.5 million on the repurchases after writing off applicable issuance costs and other
accounting adjustments. The aforementioned gains on repurchase were partially offset by a $6.8 million charge to write off fees paid for a cancelled secured debt transaction.

- 76 -


DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

•

In August 2009, we issued $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes in two equal tranches. The first $250.0 million of the senior unsecured notes mature
in February 2015 and bear interest at an effective rate of 7.50%, while the other $250.0 million of the senior unsecured notes mature in August 2019 and bear interest at an effective rate of 8.38%.

•

In November 2009, we repaid $82.1 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 7.86% on their scheduled maturity date.

•

In January 2008, we repaid $125.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 3.36% on their scheduled maturity date.

•

In May 2008, we repaid $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 6.76% on their scheduled maturity date.

•

In May 2008, we issued $325.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due in May 2013. After including the effect of forward starting swaps (see Note
14), which were designated as cash flow hedges for this offering, the effective interest rate is 7.36%.

The
fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt as of December 31, 2009 was approximately $3.0 billion. We utilized multiple broker estimates in estimating the fair value. Our unsecured notes are thinly traded and, in many cases, the broker
estimates were not based upon directly comparable transactions. As such, we have determined that our estimation of the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.

The indentures (and related supplemental indentures) governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial
ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2009.

LIBOR rate, and matures in February 2013. Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, for a total of up to $1.05 billion. This line of credit provides us with an
option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line, at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance,
including those related to fixed charge coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the DRLP unsecured line of credit agreement). As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of
credit.

The consolidated subsidiary’s unsecured line of credit allows for borrowings up to $30.0 million at a rate of
LIBOR plus .85% (equal to 1.08% for outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2009). This unsecured line of credit is used to fund development activities within the consolidated subsidiary and matures in July 2011 with, at our option, a
12-month extension.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

To the extent that there are outstanding borrowings, we utilize a discounted cash flow
methodology in order to estimate the fair value. The net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate represents the difference between the
book value and the fair value. Our estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate, considering current market conditions and our specific credit profile, at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings. The current market rate we
utilized was internally estimated; therefore, we have concluded that our determination of fair value for our unsecured lines of credit was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.

consists of providing various real estate services such as property management, maintenance, leasing, development and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, as well as our Build-for-Sale operations (defined
below), and is collectively referred to as “Service Operations”. Our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise.

(“Build-for-Sale” properties), and whose operations prior to sale are insignificant, are classified as part of the income of the Service Operations business segment. The periods of operation for Build-for-Sale properties prior to sale were
of short duration.

Other revenue consists of other operating revenues not identified with one of our operating segments.
Interest expense and other non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual segments in determining our performance measure.

We assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Funds From Operations (“FFO”), which management believes is a useful indicator of
our consolidated operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a
supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income
(loss) attributable to common shareholders. Consolidated basic FFO attributable to common shareholders should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived in accordance
with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT. We do not allocate certain income and expenses
(“Non-Segment Items” as shown in the table below) to our operating segments. Thus, the operational performance measure presented here on a segment-level basis represents net earnings excluding depreciation expense, as well as excluding the
Non-Segment Items not allocated, and is not meant to present FFO as defined by NAREIT.

Historical cost accounting for real
estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and
investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding extraordinary items
as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and
joint ventures.

Management believes that the use of consolidated basic FFO attributable to common shareholders, combined with
net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that, by
excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, investors and analysts are able to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets
that form the core of a REIT’s activity and assist in comparing these operating results between periods or as compared to different companies.

The assets for each of the reportable segments as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are
as follows (in thousands):

In addition to revenues and FFO, we also review our
recurring capital expenditures in measuring the performance of our individual Rental Operations segments. These recurring capital expenditures consist of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and building improvements. We review these
expenditures to determine the costs associated with re-leasing vacant space and maintaining the condition of our properties. Our recurring capital expenditures by segment are summarized as follows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007 (in thousands):

Leasing Activity

Future minimum rents due to us under non-cancelable operating leases at December 31, 2009 are as follows (in thousands):

In addition to minimum rents, certain leases require
reimbursements of specified operating expenses that amounted to $191.0 million, $183.2 million and $177.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Employee Benefit Plans

We maintain a 401(k) plan for full-time employees. We have historically made matching contributions up to an amount equal to three percent of the employee’s salary and may also make annual discretionary contributions. We temporarily
suspended the Company’s matching program beginning in July 2009. The total expense recognized for this plan was $1.6 million, $3.0 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We make contributions to a contributory health and welfare plan as necessary to fund claims not covered by employee contributions. The total
expense we recognized related to this plan was $11.2 million, $9.6 million and $9.3 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These expense amounts include estimates based upon the historical experience of claims incurred but not reported as of
year-end.

Shareholders’ Equity

We periodically use the public equity markets to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental properties or to pay down debt. The proceeds of these offerings are contributed to DRLP in exchange for an additional interest in
DRLP.

In April 2009, we issued 75.2 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $551.4 million.

In October 2007, we issued 7.0 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $232.7 million.

Beginning in August 2007 and continuing through December 2008, we issued new shares of common stock under employee and non-employee stock
purchase plans, as well as for dividend reinvestment plans. We received $15.5 million and $6.9 million of proceeds from these share issuances during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In February 2008, we issued $300.0 million of 8.375% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and used the net proceeds to reduce the
outstanding balance on DRLP’s unsecured line of credit. Our Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares have no stated maturity date although they may be redeemed, at our option, beginning in February 2013.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, pursuant to the share repurchase plan approved by our board of directors, we repurchased 109,500
preferred shares from all of our outstanding series. The preferred shares repurchased had a total redemption value of approximately $27.4 million, and were repurchased for $12.4 million. In conjunction with the repurchases, approximately $924,000 of
offering costs, the ratable portion of total offering costs associated with the repurchased shares, were charged against income attributable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter. A net gain of approximately $14.0 million was included in
income attributable to common shareholders. All shares repurchased were retired prior to December 31, 2008.

In October
2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7.99% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a liquidation amount of $132.3 million. Offering costs of $3.5 million were charged against net income attributable to common shareholders in
conjunction with the redemption of these shares.

The following series of preferred shares were outstanding as of
December 31, 2009 (in thousands, except percentage data):

All series of
preferred shares require cumulative distributions and have no stated maturity date (although we may redeem all such preferred shares on or following their optional redemption dates at our option, in whole or in part).

Stock Based Compensation

We are authorized to issue up to 12,692,083 shares of our common stock under our stock based employee and non-employee compensation plans.

Cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost from the exercise of stock options (excess tax benefits) were not significant in any period presented.

Fixed Stock Option Plans

We had options outstanding under five fixed stock option plans as of December 31, 2009. Additional grants may be made under one of those plans. Stock option awards granted under our stock based
employee and non-employee compensation plans generally vest over five years at 20% per year and have contractual lives of ten years. The exercise price for stock option grants is set at the fair value of our common stock on the day of grant.

The following table summarizes transactions under our stock option plans as of December 31, 2009:

(1)

Although this amount changes continuously based upon the market prices of the stock, none of the exercisable options outstanding had any pre-tax intrinsic value as of
December 31, 2009.

Options granted in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, had a
weighted average fair value per option of $1.76 and $2.89. As of December 31, 2009, there was $3.7 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options granted under the plans, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average remaining period of 2.7 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, was approximately $898,000 and $5.6 million. Compensation expense recognized for
fixed stock option plans was $2.6 million, $3.9 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $3.0
million, $2.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

The fair values of the options were determined using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate
for the term of our employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history of and our present expectation of future dividend payouts. Our computation of expected volatility for the valuation of stock options granted in the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is based on historic, and our present expectation of future volatility over a period of time equal to the expected term. The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period
the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.

Restricted Stock Units

Under our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and our 2005 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan approved by our shareholders in April 2005,
restricted stock units (“RSUs”) may be granted to non-employee directors, executive officers and selected management employees. An RSU is economically equivalent to one share of our common stock. RSUs generally vest 20% per year over
five years, have contractual lives of five years and are payable in shares of our common stock. However, RSUs granted to existing non-employee directors vest 100% over one year, and have contractual lives of one year. We recognize the value of the
granted RSUs over this vesting period as expense.

The following table summarizes transactions for our RSUs, excluding
dividend equivalents, for 2009:

Compensation cost recognized for RSUs totaled $7.3 million, $4.9 million and $3.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $6.7 million of
total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs granted under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.3 years.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments
for trading or speculative purposes.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In November 2007, we entered into forward starting interest swaps with notional amounts
appropriate to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2009. The forward starting swaps were appropriately designated and tested for effectiveness as cash flow hedges. In March 2008, we settled the forward starting
swaps and made a cash payment of $14.6 million to the counterparties. An effectiveness test was performed as of the settlement date and it was concluded that a highly effective cash flow hedge was still in place for the expected debt offering. Of
the amount paid in settlement, approximately $700,000 was immediately reclassified to interest expense, as the result of partial ineffectiveness calculated at the settlement date. The net amount of $13.9 million was recorded in Other Comprehensive
Income (“OCI”) and is being recognized through interest expense over the life of the hedged debt offering, which took place in May 2008. The remaining unamortized amount included as a reduction to accumulated OCI as of December 31,
2009 is $9.3 million.

In August 2005, we entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward starting interest
rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2007. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any changes in fair value recorded in OCI. In conjunction with the September 2007 issuance of $300.0 million
of senior unsecured notes, we terminated these cash flow hedges as designated. The settlement amount received of $10.7 million is being recognized to earnings through a reduction of interest expense over the term of the hedged cash flows. The
remaining unamortized amount included as an increase to accumulated OCI as of December 31, 2009 is $8.2 million. The ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant.

The effectiveness of our hedges is evaluated throughout their lives using the hypothetical derivative method under which the change in fair
value of the actual swap designated as the hedging instrument is compared to the change in fair value of a hypothetical swap. We had no material interest rate derivatives, when considering both fair value and notional amount, at December 31,
2009.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have guaranteed the repayment of $82.1 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We will be required to make payments
under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in
satisfaction of these guarantees.

We also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of eight of our
unconsolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately $346.9 million. With the exception of the guarantee of the debt of 3630 Peachtree joint venture, for which we have recorded a
contingent liability (footnote 7), management believes that the value of the underlying real estate exceeds the associated loan balances and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees.

In October 2000, we sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair value of $487.0 million to a joint venture
(Dugan Realty LLC) in which we have a 50% interest and recognized a net gain of $35.2 million. In connection with this transaction, the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to a $50.0 million interest in the joint venture to us in
exchange for our common stock or cash (at our option), subject to certain timing and other restrictions. As a result of this put option, we deferred $10.2 million of gain on sale of depreciated property and recorded a $50.0 million liability.

We lease certain land positions with terms extending to May 2070, with a total
obligation of $84.4 million. No payments on these ground leases are material in any individual year.

We are subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or
results of operations.
