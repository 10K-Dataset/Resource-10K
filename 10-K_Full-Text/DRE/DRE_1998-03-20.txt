   ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
   
   Duke  Realty  Investments, Inc. (the "Company") is a self-administered
   and  self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT").  The  Company
   began  operations  upon completion of its initial public  offering  in
   February  1986. In October 1993, the Company completed  an  additional
   common  stock offering and acquired the rental real estate and service
   businesses  of  Duke Associates whose operations began  in  1972.  The
   Company's  primary  business segment is the ownership  and  rental  of
   industrial,  office and retail properties throughout the Midwest.   As
   of  December  31, 1997, the Company owned interests in  a  diversified
   portfolio  of  380 rental properties comprising 45.9   million  square
   feet  (including  25  properties and three expansions  comprising  5.2
   million  square feet under development). Substantially  all  of  these
   properties   are   located  in  the  Company's  primary   markets   of
   Indianapolis, Indiana; Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, Ohio;  St.
   Louis, Missouri; Minneapolis, Minnesota and Nashville, Tennessee.   In
   addition  to  its Rental Operations, the Company, through its  Service
   Operations   provides,   on   a   fee  basis,   leasing,   management,
   construction,   development  and  other  real  estate   services   for
   approximately 8.3 million square feet of properties owned  by  third
   parties.  See  Item  7,  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis   of
   Financial  Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial
   Statements and Supplementary Data" for financial information of  these
   industry  segments.  The  Company's rental  operations  are  conducted
   through    Duke    Realty   Limited   Partnership   (the    "Operating
   Partnership").   In  addition,  the  Company  conducts   its   service
   operations through Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership  and  Duke
   Construction  Limited Partnership, in which the Company's wholly-owned
   subsidiary,  Duke  Services, Inc., is the sole  general  partner.  All
   references  to  the  "Company" in this Form 10-K  Report  include  the
   Company and those entities owned or controlled by the Company,  unless
   the   context  indicates  otherwise.  The  Company  has  the   largest
   commercial  real estate operations in Indianapolis and Cincinnati  and
   is one of the largest real estate companies in the Midwest.
   
   The  Company's  headquarters  and executive  offices  are  located  in
   Indianapolis,  Indiana. In addition, the Company  has  seven  regional
   offices located in Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Cleveland,  Ohio;
   Chicago,  Illinois; Nashville, Tennessee; St.  Louis,  Missouri
   and  Minneapolis,  Minnesota. The Company  had  620  employees  as  of
   December 31, 1997.

   BUSINESS STRATEGY
   
   The  Company's  business  objective is  to  increase  its  Funds  From
   Operations   ("FFO")  by  (i)  maintaining  and  increasing   property
   occupancy  and rental rates through the aggressive management  of  its
   portfolio  of existing properties; (ii) expanding existing properties;
   (iii)  developing and acquiring new properties; and (iv)  providing  a
   full  line  of  real estate services to the Company's tenants  and  to
   third-parties.  FFO  is defined by the National  Association  of  Real
   Estate  Investment  Trusts as net income or loss  excluding  gains  or
   losses   from   debt   restructuring  and  sales  of   property   plus
   depreciation  and  amortization, and after  adjustments  for  minority
   interest,  unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures (adjustments
   for   minority  interests,  unconsolidated  partnerships   and   joint
   ventures  are  calculated to reflect FFO on  the  same  basis).  While
   management  believes that FFO is a relevant measure of  the  Company's
   operating  performance because it is widely used by industry  analysts
   to  measure  the  operating performance of equity REITs,  such  amount
   does  not  represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally
   accepted  accounting  principles,  should  not  be  considered  as  an
   alternative  to net income as an indicator of the Company's  operating
   performance, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all  cash
   flow  needs.  As a fully integrated commercial real estate  firm,  the
   Company  believes  that its in-house leasing, management,  development
   and  construction  services  and  the Company's  significant  base  of
   commercially  zoned and unencumbered land in existing  business  parks
   should  give  the  Company  a  competitive  advantage  in  its  future
   development activities.
                                        
   The  Company  believes that the analysis of real estate  opportunities
   and  risks  can be done most effectively at regional or local  levels.
   As  a  result,  the  Company  intends  to  continue  its  emphasis  on
   increasing  its  market  share  and effective  rents  in  its  primary
   markets  within the Midwest.  The Company also expects to utilize  its
   approximately  1,700 acres of unencumbered land and its many  business
   relationships  with more than 3,300 commercial tenants to  expand  its
   build-to-suit business (development projects substantially  pre-leased
   to  a  single  tenant) and to pursue other development and acquisition
   opportunities  in its primary markets and elsewhere  in  the  Midwest.
   The  Company believes that this regional focus will allow it to assess
   market  supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well  as
   to capitalize on its strong relationships with its tenant base.
   
   The  Company's  policy  is  to seek to develop  and  acquire  Class  A
   commercial  properties located in markets with high  growth  potential
   for  Fortune 500 companies and other quality regional and local firms.
   The  Company's industrial and suburban office development  focuses  on
   business parks and mixed-use developments  suitable for development of
   multiple  projects on a single site where the Company can  create  and
   control  the business environment. These business parks and  mixed-use
   developments  generally include restaurants and other amenities  which
   the  Company  believes will create an atmosphere that is  particularly
   efficient  and desirable. The Company's retail development focuses  on
   community, power and neighborhood centers in its existing markets.  As
   a fully integrated real estate company, the Company is able to arrange
   for  or provide to its industrial, office and retail tenants not  only
   well  located  and  well maintained facilities,  but  also  additional
   services   such   as   build-to-suit   construction,   tenant   finish
   construction,  expansion  flexibility and  advertising  and  marketing
   services.
   
   Consistent  with  its  business strategy of  expanding  in  attractive
   Midwestern  markets, the Company carefully analyzed  the  real  estate
   investment  potential of several major Midwestern metropolitan  areas.
   Based  on  this  analysis, management concluded that  the Minneapolis
   and  Chicago  markets  offer  attractive   real   estate  investment
   returns  in  the industrial and  suburban  office  markets based  on
   the  following  factors: (i) fragmented  competition;  (ii)
   strong   real  estate  fundamentals;  and  (iii)  favorable   economic
   conditions.
   
                                      - 2 -
   
   
   
   In October  1997, the Company acquired a 3.2 million  gross  square
   foot  industrial  and  suburban office  portfolio  and  the  operating
   personnel  of  an  independent real estate developer and  operator  in
   Minneapolis.  Also  in 1997, the Company  established  a  regional
   office  in  Chicago and acquired 995,000 square  feet  of  suburban
   office  properties and 160 acres of land for the future development
   of  office  and  industrial properties. In  addition  to  these  major
   transactions, the Company significantly expanded its presence  in  St.
   Louis  through  the  acquisition  of  a  982,000  gross  square   foot
   primarily suburban office portfolio and the operating personnel of  an
   independent real estate developer and operator.
   
   All  of  the  Company's properties are located in areas  that  include
   competitive  properties.  Such  properties  are  generally  owned   by
   institutional  investors, other REITs or local real estate  operators;
   however,  no  single  competitor  or small  group  of  competitors  is
   dominant  in the Company's markets. The supply and demand  of  similar
   available  rental properties may affect the rental rates  the  Company
   will  receive  on  its  properties. Based upon the  current  occupancy
   rates  in  Company  and competitive properties, the  Company  believes
   there  will  not be significant competitive pressure to  lower  rental
   rates in the near future.
   
   FINANCING STRATEGY
   
   The  Company  seeks  to  maintain  a well-balanced,  conservative  and
   flexible  capital  structure by: (i) currently targeting  a  ratio  of
   long-term debt to total market capitalization in the range of  25%  to
   40%;  (ii)  extending and sequencing the maturity dates of  its  debt;
   (iii)  borrowing  primarily at fixed rates;  (iv)  generally  pursuing
   current  and future long-term debt financings and refinancings  on  an
   unsecured  basis;  and (v) maintaining conservative debt  service  and
   fixed   charge  coverage  ratios.   Management  believes  that   these
   strategies  have enabled and should continue to enable the Company  to
   access  the  debt  and  equity  capital markets  for  their  long-term
   requirements such as debt refinancings and financing development  and
   acquisitions of additional rental properties. The Company  has  raised
   approximately  $1.1 billion through public debt and  equity  offerings
   during  the  three  years  ended December 31,  1997.  Based  on  these
   offerings,  the Company has demonstrated its abilities to  access  the
   public  markets  as  a  source of capital to fund  future  growth.  In
   addition,  as  discussed  under Item 7, "Management's  Discussion  and
   Analysis  of  Financial  Condition and  Results  of  Operations,"  the
   Company  has  a  $200 million unsecured line of credit  available  for
   short-term  fundings  of  development and  acquisition  of  additional
   rental  properties. The Company's debt to total market  capitalization
   ratio  (total  market capitalization is defined as  the  total  market
   value  of  all  outstanding Common and Preferred Shares and  units  of
   limited  partnership  interest ("Units") in the Operating  Partnership
   plus  outstanding  indebtedness) at March 11,  1998  was  25.79%.  The
   Company's  ratio of earnings to debt service and ratio of earnings  to
   fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 1997 were 2.62x  and
   2.12x,  respectively. In computing the ratio of  earnings  to  debt
   service,  earnings  have  been calculated by adding  debt  service  to
   income  before gains or losses on property sales and minority interest
   in  earnings  of the Operating Partnership. Debt service  consists  of
   interest  expense  and  recurring  principal  amortization  (excluding
   maturities)  and  excludes amortization of  debt  issuance  costs.  In
   computing  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings have  been
   calculated  by  adding fixed charges, excluding capitalized  interest,
   to  income  before  gains  or losses on property  sales  and  minority
   interest  in  earnings  of  the Operating Partnership.  Fixed  charges
   consist  of  interest  costs,  whether expensed  or  capitalized,  the
   interest  component of rental expense, amortization of  debt  issuance
   costs  and preferred stock dividend requirements. Management  believes
   these measures to be consistent with its financing strategy.
   
   OTHER
   
   The  Company's  operations  are  not dependent  on  a  single  or  few
   customers  as  no single customer accounts for more  than  2%  of  the
   Company's  total revenue. The Company's operations are not subject  to
   any
   
                                      - 3 -
   
   
   
   significant  seasonal  fluctuations. The Company  believes  it  is  in
   compliance  with  environmental regulations and  does  not  anticipate
   material effects of continued compliance.

   properties  and  three expansions comprising 5.2 million  square  feet
   under  development) located primarily in five states and approximately
   1,700  acres  of  land  for  future development.  The  properties  are

      flow from operations as defined by generally accepted  accounting
      principles, should not be  considered  as  an  alternative  to  net  
      income  as  an  indicator  of  the  Company's operating  performance, 
      and is not indicative of cash available  to fund all cash flow needs.
   
   ITEM  7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION
   AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS
   
   OVERVIEW
   --------
   The Company's operating results depend primarily upon income from the
   rental operations of its industrial, office and retail properties
   located in its primary markets. This income from rental operations is
   substantially influenced by the supply and demand for the Company's
   rental space in its primary markets. In addition, the Company's
   continued growth is dependent upon its ability to maintain occupancy
   rates and increase rental rates on its in-service portfolio and to
   continue development and acquisition of additional rental properties.
   
   The Company's primary markets in the Midwest have continued to offer
   strong and stable local economies and have provided attractive new
   development opportunities because of their central location,
   established manufacturing base, skilled work force and moderate labor
   costs. Consequently, the Company's occupancy rate of its in-service
   portfolio has averaged 94.5% the last two years and was 94.1% at
   December 31, 1997.  The Company expects to maintain its overall 
   occupancy at comparable levels and also expects to increase
   rental rates as leases are renewed or new leases are executed.  This
   stable occupancy as well as increasing rental rates should improve
   the Company's results of operations from its in-service properties.
   The Company's strategy for continued growth also includes developing
   and acquiring additional rental properties in its primary markets and
   expanding into other attractive Midwestern markets.
   
   A new statistic that the Company started tracking in 1996 is Same
   Property Performance which compares those properties that were fully
   in-service for all of a two-year period. Because of the rapid growth
   of the Company, this population of properties only represented 45.3% and
   42.2% of the in-service portfolio at December 31, 1997 and December 31,
   1996, respectively. As a result of the loss of a 90,000 square foot
   downtown Cincinnati office tenant in 1996, along with the effects of a 
   property tax reassessment in another downtown Cincinnati property, Same 
   Property FFO increased only 1.1% from 1995 to 1996. In 1997, Same Property
   FFO improved  significantly with a  4.7% increase over 1996.
   
                                     - 16 -
   
   
   The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's in-
   service  portfolio of rental properties as of December  31,  1997  and
   1996 (square feet in thousands):
   
     
   Management expects occupancy of the in-service property portfolio to
   remain stable because (i) only 10.2% and 12.2% of the Company's
   occupied square footage is subject to leases expiring in 1998 and
   1999, respectively, and (ii) the Company's renewal percentage
   averaged 81%, 80% and 65% in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
   
   The following tables reflects the Company's in-service lease
   expiration schedules as of December 31, 1997, by product type
   indicating square footage and annualized net effective rents under
   expiring leases (in thousands, except per square foot amounts):
   

   This stable occupancy, along with increasing rental rates in each of
   the Company's markets, will allow the in-service portfolio to
   continue to provide a comparable or increasing level of earnings
   from rental operations. The Company also expects to realize growth
   in earnings from rental operations through (i) the development and
   acquisition of additional rental properties in its primary markets;
   (ii) the expansion into
                                     - 17 -

   
   other attractive Midwestern markets; and (iii) the completion of the
   5.2 million square feet of properties under development at December
   31, 1997 over the next five quarters. The 5.2 million square feet of
   properties under development should provide future earnings from
   rental operations growth for the Company as they are placed in
   service as follows (in thousands, except percentages):
   
     
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
   ---------------------
   A summary of the Company's operating results and property statistics
   for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1997
   is as follows (in thousands, except number of properties and per share
   amounts):

COMPARISON  OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 TO YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER  31, 1996
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Rental Operations
   -----------------
   The Company increased its in-service portfolio of rental properties
   from 249 properties comprising 27.4 million square feet at December
   31, 1996 to 355 properties comprising 40.7 million square feet at
   December 31, 1997 through the acquisition of 84 properties totaling
   8.4 million square feet and the placement in service of 28 properties
   and two building expansions totaling 5.4 million square feet
   developed by the Company.
   
   The Company also disposed of six properties totaling 443,000 square
   feet. These 106 net additional rental properties primarily account
   for the $67.5 million increase in revenues from Rental Operations
   from 1996 to 1997. The increase from 1996 to 1997 in rental expenses,
   real estate taxes and depreciation and amortization expense is also a
   result of the additional 106 in-service rental properties.
   
                                     - 18 -
   
   
   Interest expense increased by approximately $7.7 million. This
   increase was primarily because of interest expense on the $90 million
   of unsecured debt which the Company issued in 1996 under its medium-
   term note program.  These notes bear interest at a weighted average
   rate of 7.20% and were outstanding a full year in 1997 as compared to
   less than six months in 1996. The Company also issued $100 million of
   unsecured debt in 1997 which bears interest at an effective interest
   rate of 7.35%. The proceeds from these debt issuances were used
   to fund development and acquisition of additional rental properties.
   
   As a result of the above mentioned items, earnings from Rental
   Operations increased $29.4 million from $54.3 million for the year
   ended December 31, 1996 to $83.7 million for the year ended December
   31, 1997.
   
   Service Operations
   ----------------
   Service  Operations  revenues increased from $19.9  million  to  $22.4
   million  for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the  year
   ended  December  31,  1996  primarily as  a  result  of  increases  in
   construction management fee revenue because of an increase  in  third-
   party construction volume. Service Operations expenses increased  from
   $13.5  million to $15.2 million for the year ended December  31,  1997
   as  compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily as a result
   of  an  increase  in  operating expenses resulting  from  the  overall
   growth  of  the Company and the additional regional offices opened  in
   1996 and 1997.
                                        
   As  a  result  of  the  above-mentioned items, earnings  from  Service
   Operations increased from $6.4 million to $7.2 million for  the  years
   ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
   
   General and Administrative Expense
   ---------------------------------
   General and administrative expense increased from $4.7 million for
   the year ended December 31, 1996 to $6.5 million for the year ended
   December 31, 1997 primarily as a result of increased state and local
   taxes due to the growth in revenues and net income of the Company.
   Property advertising expense also increased as a result of the
   expanding size of the Company.
   
   Other Income (Expense)
   ---------------------
   Interest income increased from $1.2 million for the year ended
   December 31, 1996 to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31,
   1997 as a result of the temporary short-term investment of a greater
   amount of proceeds from the 1997 debt and equity offerings. Other
   expense consists of costs incurred in pursuit of unsuccessful
   development or acquisition opportunities.
   
   During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company sold a 251,000
   square foot corporate headquarters facility pursuant to a purchase
   option contained in the original agreement to lease the building. The
   project was sold for approximately $32.9 million and the Company
   recognized a gain of approximately $1.6 million on the sale. The
   Company also realized gains totaling $2.9 million in 1996 related to
   the sale of a retail center and several parcels of land.
   
   Net Income Available for Common Shares
   -------------------------------------
   Net income available for common shares for the year ended December
   31, 1997 was $66.0 million compared to $50.9 million for the year
   ended December 31, 1996.  This increase results primarily from the
   increases in the operating results of rental and service operations
   explained above.
   
                                     - 19 -
   
COMPARISON  OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER  31, 1995
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Rental Operations
   ----------------
   The Company increased its in-service portfolio of rental properties
   from 201 properties comprising 20.1 million square feet at December
   31, 1995 to 249 properties comprising 27.4 million square feet at
   December 31, 1996 through the acquisition of 34 properties totaling
   3.4 million square feet and the placement in service of 16 properties
   and four building expansions totaling 4.1 million square feet
   developed by the Company.
   
   The Company also disposed of two properties totaling 182,000 square
   feet. These 48 net additional rental properties primarily account for
   the $48.5 million increase in revenues from Rental Operations from
   1995 to 1996. The increase from 1995 to 1996 in rental expenses, real
   estate taxes and depreciation and amortization expense is also a
   result of the additional 48 in-service rental properties.
   
   Interest expense increased by approximately $9.9 million. This
   increase was primarily because of interest expense on the $150.0
   million of unsecured notes which the Company issued in September
   1995.  These notes bear interest at an effective rate of 7.46% 
   and were outstanding a full year in 1996 as compared to approximately
   three months in 1995. The Company also issued $90.0 million of
   unsecured debt under its medium-term note program in 1996 which bears
   interest at a weighted average rate of 7.20%. The proceeds from these
   debt issuances were used to fund development and acquisition of
   additional rental properties during 1995 and 1996.
   
   As a result of the above-mentioned items, earnings from Rental
   Operations increased $17.0 million from $37.3 million for the
   year ended December 31, 1995 to $54.3 million for the year ended
   December 31, 1996.
     
   Service Operations
   ------------------
   Service Operations revenues increased from $17.8 million to
   $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to the
   year ended December 31, 1995 primarily as a result of increases in
   construction management fee revenue because of an increase in
   construction volume. Service Operations expenses increased from $11.2
   million to $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 as
   compared to the year ended December 31, 1995 primarily as a result of
   an increase in operating expenses resulting from the overall growth
   of the Company and the additional regional offices opened in 1995 and
   1996.
   
   As a result of the above-mentioned items, earnings from Service
   Operations decreased from $6.6 million to $6.4 million for the years
   ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
   
   General and Administrative Expense
   ----------------------------------
   General and administrative expense increased from $3.5 million for
   the year ended December 31, 1995 to $4.7 million for the year ended
   December 31, 1996 primarily as a result of increased state and local
   taxes due to the growth in revenues and net income of the Company.
   Property advertising expense as well as certain public company
   expenses also increased as a result of the expanding size of the
   Company.
   
   Other Income (Expense)
   ---------------------
   Interest income decreased from $1.9 million for the year ended
   December 31, 1995 to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31,
   1996 as a result of the temporary short-term investment of a greater
   amount of proceeds from the 1995 debt and equity offerings compared
   to proceeds generated by the 1996 debt and equity offerings.
                                     - 20 -
   
   
   
   During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company sold a 251,000
   square foot corporate headquarters facility pursuant to a purchase
   option contained in the original agreement to lease the building. The
   project was sold for approximately $32.9 million and the Company
   recognized a gain of approximately $1.6 million on the sale. The
   company also realized gains totaling $2.9 million in 1996 related to
   the sale of a retail center and several parcels of land.
   
   Net Income Available for Common Shares
   -------------------------------------
   Net income available for common shares for the year ended December
   31, 1996 was $50.9 million compared to $35.0 million for the year
   ended December 31, 1995.  This increase results primarily from the
   changes in the operating result of rental and service operations
   explained above.
   
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
   
   Net cash provided by operating activities totaling $159.2 million,
   $95.1 million and $78.6 million for the years ended December 31,
   1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, represents the primary source of
   liquidity to fund distributions to shareholders and minority
   interests and to fund recurring costs associated with the renovation
   and re-letting of the Company's properties. The primary reason for
   the increases in net cash provided by operating activities is, as
   discussed above under "Results of Operations," the increase in net
   income each year resulting from the expansion of the in-service
   portfolio through development and acquisitions of additional rental
   properties.
   
   Net cash used by investing activities totaling $597.3 million, $276.7
   million and $289.6 million for the years ended December 31, 1997,
   1996 and 1995, respectively, represents the investment of funds by
   the Company to expand its portfolio of rental properties through the
   development and acquisition of additional rental properties. In 1997,
   $620.5 million was invested in the development and acquisition of
   additional rental properties and land held for development and $14.3
   million was used for recurring building and tenant improvements and
   leasing costs.
   
   Included in the $620.5 million of development and acquisition of
   rental properties and land held for development for the year ended
   December 31, 1997 is $1.3 million related to the acquisition of 41
   industrial and suburban office buildings totaling 3.2 million gross
   square feet in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The purchase price of these 41
   buildings was approximately $144.7 million which included the
   assumption of $93.1 million of mortgage debt, the issuance of $48.5
   million of units of partnership interest in the Company's operating
   partnership, and the assumption of approximately $1.8 million of
   accrued taxes and other liabilities.
   
   Also included in $620.5 million of development and acquisition of
   rental properties and land held for development for the year ended
   December 31, 1997 is $27.9 million related to the acquisition of 8
   suburban office buildings and 3 industrial buildings totaling 982,000
   gross square feet and land held for development in St. Louis,
   Missouri. The purchase price of these properties was approximately
   $147.7 million which included the assumption of $77.8 million of
   mortgage debt,  the issuance of $40.8 million of units of partnership
   interest in the Company's operating partnership and the assumption of
   approximately $1.2 million of accrued taxes and other liabilities.
   
   Also in 1997, the Company sold six properties and several parcels of
   land and received $32.6 million of net sales proceeds. These proceeds
   were used to fund a portion of the 1997 development and acquisition
   activity.
   
                                     - 21 -
   
   
   
   In 1996, $328.4 million was invested in the development and
   acquisition of additional rental properties and land held for
   development and $9.9 million was used for recurring building and
   tenant improvements and leasing costs. In 1995, $250.3 million was
   invested in the development and acquisition of additional rental
   properties and land held for development and $8.6 million was used
   for recurring building and tenant improvements and leasing costs.
   
   Net cash provided by financing activities totaling $443.1 million,
   $181.2 million and $176.2 million for the years ended December 31,
   1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, is comprised of debt and equity
   issuances, net of distributions to shareholders and minority
   interests and repayments of outstanding indebtedness. In 1997, the
   Company received $299.1 million of net proceeds from common stock
   offerings which were used to pay down amounts outstanding on the
   unsecured line of credit and to fund acquisition and development of
   additional rental properties and land held for development. During
   1997, the Company also received $18.4 million of net proceeds from
   the issuance of common stock under its Direct Stock Purchase and
   Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The Company used these net proceeds to
   fund the development and acquisition of additional rental properties.
   In July 1997, the Company received $146.1 million of net proceeds
   from a preferred stock offering. In August 1997, the Company issued
   $100.0 million of unsecured debt. This unsecured debt matures in July
   2004 and bears interest at an effective  interest rate of 7.35%. 
   The Company used the net proceeds from the preferred stock and the 
   unsecured debt offerings to reduce amounts outstanding under the 
   Company's lines of credit and to fund the development and acquisition 
   of additional rental properties.
   
   In March 1996, the Company received $125.3 million of net proceeds
   from a common stock offering which was used to pay down amounts
   outstanding on the unsecured line of credit. During 1996, the Company
   also received $5.5 million of net proceeds from the issuance of
   common stock under its Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend
   Reinvestment Plan. The Company used these net proceeds to fund the
   development and acquisition of additional rental properties.
   
   In August 1996, the Company received $72.3 million of net proceeds
   from a preferred stock offering. In July 1996, the Company issued
   $40.0 million of unsecured debt under its medium-term note program.
   These notes mature in July 2000 and bear interest at 7.28%. In
   November 1996, the Company issued $50.0 million of unsecured debt
   under its medium-term note program. These notes mature in November
   2004 and bear interest at 7.14%. The Company used the net proceeds
   from the preferred stock offering and the two medium-term note
   offerings to pay off approximately $82.5 million of existing secured
   debt which was scheduled to mature in the fourth quarter of 1996 or
   early in 1997 and the remainder to fund the development and
   acquisition of additional rental properties.
   
   In 1995, the Company received $96.3 million of net proceeds from a
   common stock offering and used the proceeds to fund development and
   acquisition of additional rental properties. In 1995, the Company
   also received $150.0 million from an unsecured debt offering and used
   the proceeds to retire outstanding mortgage indebtedness and to fund
   acquisition and development of additional rental properties.
   
   The recurring capital needs of the Company are funded primarily
   through the undistributed net cash provided by operating activities.
   An analysis of the Company's recurring capital expenditures is as
   follows (in thousands):
   
                                     - 22 -
   
   The Company has a $200.0 million unsecured line of credit available
   to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental
   properties and to provide working capital as needed. This line of
   credit matures in April 2001 and bears interest at the 30-day London
   Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus .80%. Borrowings of $13.0
   million under this line of credit as of December 31, 1997  bear
   interest at an effective rate of 6.74%. The Company also has a demand
   $7.0 million secured line of credit which is available to provide
   working capital. This facility bears interest payable monthly at the
   30-day LIBOR rate plus .65%. Borrowings of $7.0 million are
   outstanding on this line of credit at December 31, 1997 and bear
   interest at an effective rate of 6.59%. The current 30-day LIBOR rate
   as of March 2, 1998 is 5.68%.
   
   The Company currently has on file two Form S-3 Registration
   Statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Shelf
   Registrations") which have remaining availability as of December 31,
   1997 of $504.1 million to issue additional common stock, preferred
   stock and unsecured debt securities. The Company intends to issue
   additional securities under such Shelf Registrations to fund the
   development and acquisition of additional rental properties.
   
   The total debt outstanding at December 31, 1997 consists of notes
   totaling $720.1 million with a weighted average interest rate of
   7.58% maturing at various dates through 2017. The Company has $353.0
   million of unsecured debt and $367.1 million of secured debt
   outstanding at December 31, 1997. Scheduled principal amortization of
   such debt totaled $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.
   A summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of the
   Company's indebtedness is as follows (in thousands):
   
   
   The  Company intends to pay regular quarterly dividends from net  cash
   provided  by  operating activities. A quarterly dividend of  $.30  per
   common  share  was  declared on January 29, 1998 which  represents  an
   annualized dividend of $1.20 per share.
   
   YEAR 2000
   
   The  Company  has  reviewed  the impact of  Year  2000  issues  and  has
   determined  that it is not expected to  have a material  impact  on
   its business, operations or its financial condition.
   
   FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS
   
   Management believes that Funds From Operations ("FFO"), which is
   defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
   as net income or loss excluding gains or losses from debt
   restructuring and
   
   
                                     - 23 -
   
   
   
   sales of property plus depreciation and amortization, and after
   adjustments for minority interest, unconsolidated partnerships and
   joint ventures (adjustments for minority interest, unconsolidated
   partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the
   same basis), is the industry standard for reporting the operations of
   real estate investment trusts.
   
   The following reflects the calculation of the Company's FFO for the
   years ended December 31 (in thousands):
   
   
   
   The increase in FFO during the three-year period results primarily
   from the increased in-service rental property portfolio as
   discussed above under "Results of Operations."
   
   While management believes that FFO is the most relevant and widely
   used measure of the Company's operating performance, such amount
   does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by
   generally accepted accounting principles, should not be considered
   as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's
   operating performance, and is not indicative of cash available to
   fund all cash flow needs.

      INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
      
      The Shareholders and Directors of
      Duke Realty Investments, Inc.:
      
      We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Duke
      Realty Investments, Inc. and Subsidiaries as listed in the
      accompanying index. In connection with our audits of the
      consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
      financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index.
      These consolidated financial statements and the financial
      statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
      management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
      consolidated financial statements and the financial statement
      schedule based on our audits.
      
      We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
      auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
      perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
      financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
      includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
      amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
      includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
      estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
      provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
      
      In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
      above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
      position of Duke Realty Investments, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
      December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their operations
      and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
      period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally
      accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related
      financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
      basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
      fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
      therein.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
   (1) THE COMPANY
       -------------
       The Company was formed in 1985 and qualifies as a real estate
       investment trust ("REIT") under the provisions of the Internal
       Revenue Code.  The Company is a self-administered REIT which owns
       and operates a portfolio of industrial, office and retail
       properties in the Midwest. The Company's primary markets are
       Indianapolis, Indiana; Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio;
       St. Louis, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota
       and Nashville, Tennessee.
     
       The  Company's rental operations are conducted through Duke Realty
       Limited  Partnership ("DRLP"), of which the Company owns 87.4%  at
       December  31,  1997.  The remaining interests  in  DRLP  ("Limited
       Partner Units") are exchangeable by the unitholders for shares  of
       the  Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis.  In  addition,
       the  Company  conducts  operations through  Duke  Realty  Services
       Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited Partnership,  in
       which  the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Duke Services, Inc.,
       is the sole general partner.
       
  (2)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
       ------------------------------------------
       PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
       --------------------------
       The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
       Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. The
       equity interests in these majority-owned or controlled
       subsidiaries not owned by the Company are reflected as minority
       interests in the consolidated financial statements. All
       significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
       eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
     
       RECLASSIFICATIONS
       ------------------
       Certain 1996 and 1995 balances have been reclassified to conform
       with the 1997 presentation.
       
       STOCK SPLIT
       -----------
       All shares and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect
       the Company's two-for-one stock split effected in August 1997.
       
       SEGMENT OPERATIONS
        -----------------
       The Company is engaged in two business segments, the ownership
       and rental of real estate investments ("Rental Operations") and
       the providing of various real estate services such as property
       management, maintenance, leasing and construction management to
       third-party property owners ("Service Operations"). There are no
       material intersegment sales or transfers between Rental
       Operations and Service Operations. The identifiable assets of the
       Service Operations consisting of cash, accounts receivable,
       construction receivables and other assets as of December 31, 1997
       and 1996 were $37.4 million and $20.7 million, respectively.
       Capital expenditures related to Service Operations were $4.8
      
                                     - 32 -
                                        
       
                                        
                 DUKE REALTY INVESTMENTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                                        
       million, $2.0 million and $1.5 million for the years ended
       December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. All remaining
       assets, capital expenditures, depreciation, amortization and
       investments in and advances to unconsolidated companies relate to
       Rental Operations. The operations of each segment are reflected
       separately on the Statement of Operations.
       
       REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS
       -----------------------
       Real estate investments are stated at the lower of  cost less
       accumulated depreciation or fair value if impairment is
       identified. Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on
       the straight-line method over 40 years, and tenant improvement
       costs are depreciated on the straight-line method over the term
       of the related lease.
       
       All direct and indirect costs, including interest and real estate
       taxes clearly associated with the acquisition, development,
       construction or expansion of real estate investments are
       capitalized as a cost of the property and depreciated over the
       estimated useful life of the related asset.
       
       The Company evaluates its real estate investments upon occurrence
       of significant changes in the operations, but not less than
       annually, to assess whether any impairment indications are
       present, including recurring operating losses and significant
       adverse changes in legal factors or business climate that affect
       the recovery of the recorded value. If any real estate investment
       is considered impaired, a loss is provided to reduce the carrying
       value of the property to its estimated fair value.
       
       CASH EQUIVALENTS
       ----------------
       Highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less
       when purchased are classified as cash equivalents.
       
       DEFERRED COSTS
       -------------
       Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are
       amortized on the straight-line method over the term of the
       related loan. All direct and indirect costs associated with the
       rental of real estate projects owned by the Company are amortized
       over the term of the related lease. Unamortized costs are charged
       to expense upon the early termination of the lease or upon early
       payment of the financing.
       
       Prepaid interest is amortized to interest expense using the
       effective interest method over the terms of the related loans.
    
       REVENUES
       -------
       Rental Operations
       -----------------
       Rental income from leases with scheduled rental increases during

       Service Operations
       ------------------
       Management fees are based on a percentage of rental receipts of
       properties managed and are recognized as the rental receipts are
       collected. Maintenance fees are based upon established hourly
       rates and are recognized as the services are performed.  Leasing
       fees are based on a percentage of the total rental due
       under  completed  leases and are generally recognized  upon  lease
       execution.  Construction  management  and  development  fees   are
       generally  based  on a percentage of costs and are  recognized  as
       the  project  costs are incurred. Other income consists  primarily
       of   payroll   reimbursements  for  on-site  property   management
       services.
       
       NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
       ---------------------------
       Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net
       income available  for common shares by the weighted average number 
       of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income 
       per share is computed by dividing the sum of net income available 
       for common shares and minority interest in earnings of unitholders, 
       by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and 
       dilutive potential common shares outstanding for the period.
     
       The  following  table  reconciles  the  components  of  basic  and
       diluted net income per share:
       
       
     
       FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
       ------------------
       The Company qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as a
       REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, the Company is
       allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of its
       distributions to shareholders. As deductible distributions have
       exceeded taxable income, no provision for federal income taxes
       has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial
       statements.
       
       Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends
       to shareholders, differ from net income reported for financial
       reporting purposes primarily because of different depreciable
       lives and bases of rental properties and differences in the
       timing of recognition of earnings upon disposition of properties.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
       A summary of the taxable nature of the Company's dividends for
       the three years ended December 31 is as follows:
       
       
       Dividends per share of $.97, $.89 and $.74 were required for the
       Company to maintain its REIT status in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
       respectively.
       
       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
       -----------------------------------
       The fair values of the Company's financial instruments, including
       accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, mortgage
       debt, unsecured notes payable, lines of credit and other
       financial instruments, generally determined using the present
       value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate
       commensurate with the risks involved, approximate their carrying
       or contract values.
       
       USE OF ESTIMATES
       ----------------
       The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
       conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
       management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
       amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
       accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
       estimates.
  
       DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
       --------------------------------
       The Company may enter into derivative financial instruments such
       as interest rate swaps and treasury locks in order to mitigate
       its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. The
       Company has designated these derivative financial instruments as
       hedges and applies deferral accounting as the instrument to be
       hedged exposes the Company to interest rate risk and the
       derivative financial instrument reduces that exposure. Gains and
       losses related to the derivative financial instrument are
       deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the
       hedged instrument.
     
   (3)  Related Party Transactions
       --------------------------
       The Company provides management, leasing, construction and other
       tenant related services to partnerships in which certain
       executive officers have continuing ownership interests. The
       Company was paid fees totaling $3.3 million, $3.2 million and
       $2.8 million for such services in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
       respectively.  Management believes the terms for such services
       are equivalent to those available in the market. The Company has
       an option to purchase the executive officers' interest in each of
       these properties which expires October 2003. The option price of
       each property was established at the date the options were
       granted.

   (4)  Acquisitions of Real Estate Property Investments
       -------------------------------------------------
       In October 1997, the Company acquired a 982,000 square foot
       suburban office and industrial portfolio and undeveloped land
       from and the operating personnel of an independent real estate
       developer and operator in St. Louis, Missouri. The purchase price
       of this portfolio was approximately $147.7 million which included
       the assumption of $77.8 million of mortgage debt, the issuance of
       $40.8 million of Limited Partner Units, the assumption of
       approximately $1.2 million of accrued taxes and other
       liabilities, and $27.9 million of cash.
       
       Also in October 1997, the Company acquired a 3.2 million square
       foot industrial and suburban office portfolio and the operating
       personnel from an independent real estate developer and
       operator in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The purchase price of this
       portfolio was approximately $144.7 million which included the
       assumption of $93.1 million of mortgage debt, the issuance of
       $48.5 million of Limited Partner Units, the assumption of
       approximately $1.8 million of accrued taxes and other
       liabilities, and $1.3 million of cash.

   (5) Investments in Unconsolidated Companies
       ---------------------------------------
       The Company has equity interests in unconsolidated partnerships
       and joint ventures which own and operate rental properties and
       hold land for development in the Midwest. The equity method of
       accounting is used for these investments in which the Company has
       the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
       financial policies. Any difference between the carrying amount of
       these investments and the underlying equity in net assets is
       amortized to equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies over
       40 years. The cost method of accounting is used for non-majority
       owned joint ventures over which the Company does not have the
       ability to exercise significant influence. The difference between
       the cost method and the equity method for such ventures does not
       significantly affect the financial position or results of
       operations of the Company.
       
       In 1995, the Company acquired its unaffiliated partner's 50%
       interest in a joint venture which owned two suburban office
       rental properties (one of which was under construction as of
       December 31, 1995) and 40.3 acres of land held for development.
       The Company accounted for the acquisition of the 50% interest
       using the purchase method with its recorded investment in the
       properties equal to the sum of the balance of its investment in
       and advances to the joint venture at the date of acquisition, the
       net liabilities assumed and cash paid to the joint venture
       partner amounting to $24.4 million.
       
       On December 28, 1995, the Company formed a joint venture (Dugan
       Realty LLC) with an institutional real estate investor and
       purchased 25 industrial buildings totaling approximately 2.3
       million square feet. Upon formation of the venture, the Company
       contributed approximately 1.4 million square feet of recently
       developed and acquired industrial properties, 113 acres of
       recently acquired land held for future development at an agreed
       value of $50.8 million, and approximately $16.7 million of cash
       for a 50.1% interest in the joint venture. The Company's recorded
       investment at December 31, 1995 in the joint venture of $59.4
       million is the sum of the carrying value of the properties, land
       and cash contributed. The Company's joint venture partner
       contributed cash of $67.5 million for its 49.9% interest in
       the venture. The cash contributed by the Company and the joint
       venture partner was used to purchase the 25 industrial buildings
       noted above. The recently acquired industrial properties and the
       undeveloped land which were contributed were acquired as part of
       the acquisition of Park Fletcher, Inc.,

                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

       an Indianapolis, Indiana based real estate development and 
       management company. The acquisition was accounted for under the 
       purchase method. The recorded carrying value of the acquired 
       properties and land was equal to the net liabilities assumed 
       plus cash paid plus mortgage indebtedness assumed of $17.4 
       million. The fair value of the property exceeds the Company's 
       recorded investment. The operating results of the acquired 
       properties and land have been included in the consolidated 
       operating results subsequent to the date of acquisition. The 
       Company completed the development of 1.1 million square feet of 
       property in 1996 and contributed these properties to the joint 
       venture at an agreed value of $24.9 million. The Company recorded 
       its investment in the joint venture related to this additional 
       contribution at its carrying value of $20.5 million. The joint 
       venture partner contributed cash of $12.4 million to the venture, 
       which equaled 49.9% of the agreed value of the properties contributed. 
       The cash was distributed to the Company and reduced its recorded 
       investment in the venture. During 1997, the Company contributed an 
       additional six buildings totaling two million square feet with an 
       agreed value of $60.8 million and received a cash distribution of $60
       million from the proceeds of a mortgage loan received in May of 1997.
       The joint venture partner contributed $753,000 of cash to the venture 
       to maintain proportionate ownership interest. The Company accounts 
       for its investment in this joint venture on the equity method because 
       the joint venture partner's approval is required for all major
       decisions, and the joint venture partner has equal control
       regarding the primary day-to-day operations of the venture.
                                        
       In May 1997, the Company formed a joint venture
       (Dugan/Office, LLC) with an institutional real estate investor,
       to which each venture partner contributed $32.2 million in cash
       for a 50% ownership interest. Simultaneously, the contributed
       cash was used to purchase office property consisting of
       approximately 345,000 square feet and 17 acres of undeveloped
       land.
       
       Combined summarized financial information of the companies which
       are accounted for by the equity method as of December 31, 1997
       and December 31, 1996 and for the years ended December 31, 1997,
       1996, and 1995 are as follows (in thousands):

       Investments in unconsolidated companies include $6.1 million at
       December 31, 1997 and 1996 related to joint ventures accounted
       for on the cost method. Included in equity in earnings of
       unconsolidated companies are distributions from a joint venture
       accounted for on the cost method totaling $947,000, $735,000 and
       $521,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
       
 (6)  INDEBTEDNESS
       ------------
      
     
     As of December 31, 1997, the $367.1 million of secured debt is
     collateralized by rental properties with a net carrying value of
     $641.9 million.
     
     In April 1995, the Company obtained an unsecured line of credit in
     the aggregate amount of $100 million which required interest at 30-
     day LIBOR plus 2.00% (effective rate of 7.69% as of December 31,
     1995). In 1996, the Company increased the amount available under the
     line to $150 million and reduced the borrowing rate to LIBOR plus
     1.25% (effective rate of 6.75% as of December 31, 1996). In 1997,
     the Company increased the amount available under the line to $200
     million and reduced the borrowing rate to LIBOR plus .80% (effective
     rate of 6.74% as of December 31, 1997). The unsecured line of credit
     matures in April 2001.
     
     The Company has an interest rate swap agreement (the "Agreement") on
     $33.0 million of the Company's outstanding mortgage debt to
     effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of its floating rate
     debt. Under the Agreement, the Company pays or receives the
     difference between a fixed rate of 5.19% and a floating rate of 30-
     day LIBOR plus 75% based on the notional principal amount of $33.0
     million. The amount paid or received under the Agreement is included
     in interest expense on a monthly basis. The Agreement matures along
     with the related mortgage loan in December 1999. The Agreement will
     stay in place until maturity unless the 30-day LIBOR rate on the
     date of monthly repricing exceeds 6.25% which will cause a
     termination of the Agreement. The 30-day LIBOR rate at December 31,
     1997 was 5.94%. The estimated fair value of the Agreement at
     December 31, 1997 was $428,000. The fair value was estimated by
     discounting the expected cash flows to be received under the
     Agreement using rates currently available for interest rate swaps of
     similar terms and maturities.
     
     The Company has a $75.0 million ("Notional Principal") forward
     Treasury Lock Agreement (the "Treasury Lock") which is intended to
     fix the effective interest rate of future financings by the Company.
     Under the Treasury Lock, the Company will pay or receive the
     difference between a fixed rate of 5.86% and the  ten year treasury
     rate as of February 26, 1998 (the "Determination Date"). The ten
     year treasury rate at December 31, 1997 was 5.74%. The estimated
     fair value of the Treasury Lock at December 31, 1997 was ($672,000).
     The fair value was estimated by multiplying the $75.0 million
     Notional Principal times the present value of the December 31, 1997
     rate difference based upon semi-annual corresponding periods over a
     ten year term.

     capitalized in 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $6.0 million, $5.5 million
     and $4.2 million, respectively.
     
 (7) LEASING ACTIVITY
     ----------------
     Future  minimum  rents  due  to  the  Company  under  non-cancelable
     operating  leases at December 31, 1997 are scheduled as follows  (in

     In addition to minimum rents, certain leases require reimbursements
     of specified operating expenses which amounted to $33.8 million,
     $19.7 million, and $12.7 million for the years ended December 31,
     1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
     
 (8) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
     ----------------------
     The Company maintains a 401(k) plan for the benefit of its full-time 
     employees. The Company matches the employees' contributions up to two 
     percent of the employees' salary and may also make annual discretionary
     contributions. Total expense recognized by the Company was $882,000, 
     $328,000 and $245,000 for the years ended 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
     respectively.
     
     The Company makes contributions to a contributory health and welfare
     plan as necessary to fund claims not covered by employee
     contributions. Total expense recognized by the Company related to
     this plan was $1,245,000, $1,193,000 and $882,000 for 1997, 1996 and
     1995, respectively. Included in total expense is an estimate based
     on historical experience of the effect of claims incurred but not
     reported as of year-end.

 (9) Shareholders' Equity
     --------------------
     The Company periodically accesses the public equity markets to fund
     the development and acquisition of additional rental properties. The
     proceeds of these offerings are contributed to DRLP in exchange for
     additional interest in the partnership. A summary of the public
     equity issuances during the three-year period ended December 31,
     1997 is as follows (in thousands, except per share price):
     
       
     During the three years ended December 31, 1997, the Company acquired
     a portion of the minority interest in DRLP through the issuance of
     shares of common stock for a like number of Limited Partner Units.
     The acquisition of the minority interest was recorded under the
     purchase method with assets acquired reflected at the fair market
     value of the Company's common stock on the date of acquisition. The
     following acquisition amounts were allocated to rental property,
     undeveloped land and investments in unconsolidated companies based
     on their estimated fair values (in thousands):
     
       
     In August 1996, the Company issued 300,000 shares of 9.10% Series A
     Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares receiving net proceeds of
     approximately $72.3 million. On or after August 31, 2001, the Series
     A Preferred Shares may be redeemed for cash at the option of the
     Company, in whole or in part at a redemption price of $250.00 per
     share plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any, to the
     redemption date. The redemption price of the Series A Preferred
     Shares (other than any portion thereof consisting of accrued and
     unpaid distributions) may only be paid from the proceeds of other
     capital shares of the Company, which may include other classes or
     series of preferred shares. The Series A Preferred Shares have no
     stated maturity, are not subject to sinking fund or mandatory
     redemption provisions and are not convertible into any other
     securities of the Company. Distributions on the Series A Preferred
     Shares are cumulative from the date of original issue and are

     accrued and unpaid distributions, if any, to the redemption date.
     The redemption price of the Series B Preferred Shares (other than
     any portion thereof consisting of accrued and unpaid distributions)
     may only be paid from the proceeds of other capital shares of the
     Company, which may include other classes or series of preferred
     shares. The Series B Preferred Shares have no stated maturity, are
     not subject to sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions and
     are not convertible into any other securities of the Company.
     Distributions on the Series B Preferred Shares are cumulative from
     the date of original issue and are payable quarterly on or about the
     last day of March, June, September, and December of each year,
     commencing on September 30, 1997, at the rate of 7.99% of the
     liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $39.95 per annum per
     share) through September 30, 2012 and at a rate of 9.99% of the
     liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $49.95 per annum
     per share) thereafter.
     
(10) STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
     -------------------------
     The Company has four stock-based compensation plans, which are
     described below. The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related
     interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no
     compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock option
     plans. The Company charges compensation costs against its income
     for its two performance based stock plans. If compensation cost for
     the Company's four stock-based compensation plans had been
     determined consistent with FASB Statement No. 123, the Company's
     net income and net income per share for the years ended December 31
     would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:
     
     
     The effects of applying FASB Statement No. 123 in this pro forma
     disclosure are not indicative of future amounts. The Statement does
     not apply to awards prior to 1995, and additional awards in future
     years are anticipated.

     FIXED STOCK OPTION PLANS

     The Company has two fixed stock options plans, the Duke Realty Services 
     1993 Stock Option Plan (the "1993 Plan") and the 1995 Key Employees'
     Stock Option Plan of Duke Realty Investments, Inc. (the "1995 Plan").
     Under the 1995 Plan, the Company is authorized to grant options to its
     employees for up to 1,116,800 shares of common stock, as well as up to an 
     additional 800,000 shares to the extent grants under the 1993 Plan lapse,
     are forfeited or are otherwise terminated. The 1995 Plan was adopted in 
     1995 subject to shareholder approval, which approval was received in
     1996. Under the 1993 Plan, the Company was authorized to grant
     options to its employees for up to 2,630,000 shares of common stock,
     of which 1,178,700 are outstanding as of December 31, 1997. No
     further grants are permitted under the 1993 Plan.
     
     Under both plans, the exercise price of each option equals the
     market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant, and each
     option's maximum term is ten years. Options granted under both plans
     vest at 20% per year, or, if earlier, upon the death, retirement or
     disability of the optionee or a change in control of the Company.
     
     The fair value of each option for all grants is estimated on the
     date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
     following assumptions used: Dividend yield of 5.8% for 1997 grants
     and 6.0% for 1996 and 1995 grants; expected volatility of 19% for
     all grants; weighted average risk-free interest rates of 6.4%, 5.6%
     and 6.8% for 1997, 1996 and 1995 grants, respectively; and weighted
     average expected lives of  6.5 years, 7.9 years, 7.8 years for 1997,
     1996 and 1995 grants, respectively.
     
     A summary of the status of the Company's two fixed stock option
     plans as of December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, and changes during the
     years ended on those dates is as follows:

     outstanding at December 31, 1997:

     Performance Based Stock Plans
     -----------------------------
     The Company has two performance based equity compensation plans.
     Under the 1995 Dividend Increase Unit Plan (the "DIU Plan"),
     Dividend Increase Units ("DIUs") are granted to key employees. The
     value of DIUs exercised by employees is payable in company stock. A
     maximum of 200,000 shares of Company stock may be issued under the
     DIU Plan. The maximum term of all DIUs granted is ten years.
     
     The value of each DIU when exercised is equal to the increase in the
     Company's annualized dividend per share from the date of grant to
     the date of exercise, divided by the "dividend yield." Dividend
     yield is the annualized dividend per share divided by the market
     price per share of the Company's common stock at the date of grant.
     DIUs are subject to the same vesting schedule as stock options
     issued under the 1995 Plan. The compensation cost that has been
     charged against income for the DIU Plan was $1,474,000, $152,000 and
     $30,000 for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. A summary of the
     status of DIUs granted by the Company is as follows:
     
     
     Under the 1995 Shareholder Value Plan (the "SV Plan"), the Company
     may grant awards in specified dollar amounts to key employees. The
     award is payable to the employee on the third anniversary of the
     date of grant. One-half of the award is payable in common stock of
     the Company, and one-half is payable in cash. A maximum of 200,000
     shares of Company stock may be issued under the SV Plan.
     
     The initial dollar amount of each award granted under the SV Plan is
     adjusted upward or downward based on a comparison of the Company's
     cumulative total shareholder return for the three year period as
     compared to the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 and the
     NAREIT Equity REIT Total Return indices. The award is not payable
     upon the employee's termination of employment for any reason other
     than retirement, death, disability or a change in control of the
     Company.
     
     The following table summarizes information about the initial amount
     of SV Plan awards granted in 1997, 1996 and 1995:
     
     
     
     The Company believes that it is not possible to reasonably estimate
     the fair value of the common stock to be issued under the DIU and SV
     Plans and, therefore, computes compensation cost for the Plans based
     on the intrinsic value of the awards as if they were exercised at
     the end of each applicable reporting period. The compensation cost
     that has been charged against income for the SV Plan was $1,041,000,
     and $361,000 and $152,000 for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
