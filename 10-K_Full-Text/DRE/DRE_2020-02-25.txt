Other than those portions of the 2020 Proxy Statement specifically incorporated by reference pursuant to Items 10 through 14 of Part III hereof, no other portions of the 2020 Proxy Statement shall be deemed so incorporated.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report (the "Report") combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2019

of both Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "Duke Realty Corporation" or the "General Partner" mean Duke Realty Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries; and references to the "Partnership" mean Duke Realty Limited Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to the General Partner and the Partnership, collectively, and those entities owned or controlled by the General Partner and/or the Partnership.

Duke Realty Corporation is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") and is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning

99.2%

of the common partnership interests of the Partnership ("General Partner Units") as of

December 31, 2019

. The remaining

0.8%

of the common partnership interests ("Limited Partner Units" and, together with the General Partner Units, the "Common Units") are owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Partnership, the General Partner has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Partnership.

The General Partner and the Partnership are operated as one enterprise. The management of the General Partner consists of the same members as the management of the Partnership. As the sole general partner with control of the Partnership, the General Partner consolidates the Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same.

We believe combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of the General Partner and the Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits:

•

enhances investors' understanding of the General Partner and the Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;

•

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation of information since a substantial portion of the Company's disclosure applies to both the General Partner and the Partnership; and

•

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

We believe it is important to understand the few differences between the General Partner and the Partnership in the context of how we operate as an interrelated consolidated company. The General Partner's only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests in the Partnership. As a result, the General Partner does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Partnership and issuing public equity from time to time. The General Partner does not issue any indebtedness, but does guarantee some of the unsecured debt of the Partnership. The Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the business, directly or indirectly, and holds the ownership interests related to certain of the Company's investments. The Partnership conducts the operations of the business and has no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the General Partner, which are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for General Partner Units or Preferred Units, the Partnership generates the capital required by the business through its operations, its incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of Limited Partner Units to third parties.

Noncontrolling interests, shareholders' equity and partners' capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the General Partner and those of the Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the Partnership's financial statements include the interests in consolidated investees not wholly owned by the Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the General Partner's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Partnership level, as well as the common limited partnership interests in the Partnership, which are accounted for as partners' capital by the Partnership.

In order to highlight the differences between the General Partner and the Partnership, there are separate sections in this report, as applicable, that separately discuss the General Partner and the Partnership, including separate financial statements and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure of the General Partner and the Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the collective Company.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT

Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Report on Form 10-K for the General Partner and the Partnership, including, without limitation, those related to our future operations, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words "believe," "estimate," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "strategy," "continue," "plan," "seek," "could," "may" and similar expressions or statements regarding future periods are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements may contain such words.

These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from any predictions of future results, performance or achievements that we express or imply in this Report or in the information incorporated by reference into this Report. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may affect future results include, among others:

•

Changes in general economic and business conditions, including the financial condition of our tenants and the value of our real estate assets;

•

The General Partner's continued qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

•

Heightened competition for tenants and potential decreases in property occupancy;

•

Potential changes in the financial markets and interest rates;

•

Volatility in the General Partner's stock price and trading volume;

•

Our continuing ability to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all;

•

Our ability to successfully identify, acquire, develop and/or manage properties on terms that are favorable to us;

•

Potential increases in real estate construction costs including construction cost increases as the result of trade disputes and tariffs on goods imported in the United States;

Other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in our other reports and other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Although we presently believe that the plans, expectations and anticipated results expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Report are reasonable, all forward-looking statements are inherently subjective, uncertain and subject to change, as they involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including those beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict the nature, or assess the potential impact, of each new factor on our business. Given these uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We undertake no

-

obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements for events or circumstances that arise after the statement is made, except as otherwise may be required by law.

The above list of risks and uncertainties is only a summary of some of the most important factors and is not intended to be exhaustive. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included under the caption "Risk Factors" in this Report, and is updated by us from time to time in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings that we make with the SEC.

PART I

Item 1.  Business

Background

The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of bulk distribution ("industrial") real estate.

The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of an initial public offering in February 1986.

The Partnership was formed in October 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning

99.2%

of the Common Units at

December 31, 2019

. The remaining

0.8%

of the Common Units are owned by limited partners. Limited partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement"), the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner.

At

December 31, 2019

, we owned or jointly controlled


primarily industrial properties which encompassed

155.3 million

rentable square feet (including


unconsolidated joint venture in-service properties with

11.0 million

square feet,


consolidated properties under development with

8.7 million

square feet and

one

unconsolidated joint venture property under development with

133,000

square feet). Our properties are leased by a diverse base of more than 800 tenants whose businesses include e-commerce, manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, and distribution. We also owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), 1,380 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,000 acres through purchase options.

Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. We additionally have regional offices or significant operations in 19 other geographic or metropolitan areas including Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; Washington D.C./Baltimore, Maryland; Central Florida; New Jersey; Northern and Southern California; Pennsylvania and South Florida. We had approximately 400 employees at

December 31, 2019

.

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information related to our operational, asset and capital strategies.

Competitive Conditions

As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which we believe, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage as a real estate operator and in future development activities.

We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or on local levels. As a result, we intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market share, to the extent it is in markets that align with our asset strategy (see Item 7), and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on our many strong relationships with customers that operate on a national level. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our tenants not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.

All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply of and demand for similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator.

Corporate Governance

Since our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer operationally, but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. The General Partner's system of governance reinforces this commitment and, as a limited partnership that has one general partner owning over 90% of the Partnership's common interest, the governance of the Partnership is necessarily linked to the corporate governance of the General Partner. Summarized below are the highlights of the General Partner's Corporate Governance initiatives.

-


-

The General Partner's Code of Business Ethics (which applies to all directors and employees of the General Partner, including the Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers) and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are available in the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of the General Partner's website at www.dukerealty.com. A copy of these documents may also be obtained without charge by writing to Duke Realty Corporation, 8711 River Crossing Boulevard, Indianapolis, Indiana 46240, Attention: Investor Relations.  If we amend our Code of Business Ethics as it applies to the directors and all executive officers of the General Partner or grant a waiver from any provision of the Code of Business Ethics to any such person, we may, rather than filing a current report on Form 8-K, disclose such amendment or waiver in the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of the General Partner's website at www.dukerealty.com.

Available Information

In addition to this Report, we file quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. All documents that are filed with the SEC are available free of charge on the General Partner's corporate website, which is www.dukerealty.com. We are not incorporating the information on the General Partner's website into this Report, and the General Partner's website and the information appearing on the General Partner's website is not included in, and is not part of, this Report. You may also access any document filed through the SEC's home page on the Internet (http://www.sec.gov).

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this Report, you should carefully consider, in consultation with your legal, financial and other professional advisors, the risks described below, as well as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption "Risk Factors" in evaluating us and our business before making a decision regarding an investment in the General Partner's securities.

The risks contained in this Report are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem to be immaterial, also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. The trading price of the General Partner's securities could decline due to the materialization of any of these risks, and its shareholders and/or the Partnership's unitholders may lose all or part of their investment.

This Report also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section in this Report entitled "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.

Risks Related to Our Business

Our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the long-term risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness, or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to refinance borrowings by our unconsolidated subsidiaries on favorable terms or at all. If our debt cannot be paid, refinanced or extended, we may not be able to make distributions to shareholders and unitholders at expected levels. Further, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher interest rates or other restrictive financial covenants upon the refinancing, then such refinancing would adversely affect our cash flow and funds available for operation, development and distribution.

We also have incurred, and may incur in the future, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Thus, if market interest rates increase, so will our interest expense, which could reduce our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and unitholders at expected levels.

Debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our shareholders and unitholders.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common equity and, at times, preferred equity issued by the General Partner. Debt financing may not be available over a longer period of time in sufficient amounts, on favorable terms or at all. If the General Partner issues additional equity securities, instead of debt, to manage capital needs, the interests of our existing shareholders and unitholders could be diluted.

-


-

Financial and other covenants under existing credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.

The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As a result, we would also likely be unable to borrow any further amounts under our other debt instruments and other debt obligations may be accelerated, which could adversely affect our ability to fund operations.

Downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs or reduce our access to funding sources in the credit and capital markets.

We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, consisting mostly of unsecured debt. We are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor's Ratings Group based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. All of our debt ratings remain investment grade, but there can be no assurance that we will not be downgraded or that any of our ratings will remain investment grade. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.

Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

If we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity, then we may be unable to pursue future development projects and other strategic initiatives.

To complete our ongoing and planned development projects, and to pursue our other strategic initiatives, we must continue to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to fund those activities. To generate that capital and liquidity, we rely upon funds from our existing operations, as well as funds that we raise through our capital raising activities. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our long-term needs, or if we are unable to generate capital and liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, then we may not be able to pursue development projects, acquisitions, or our other long-term strategic initiatives.

The General Partner's stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to its shareholders and to the Partnership's unitholders, if and when they convert their Limited Partner Units to shares of the General Partner's common stock.

The market price of the General Partner's common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in the General Partner's common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the General Partner's share price, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the General Partner's common stock, include uncertainty in the markets, general market and economic conditions, as well as those factors described in these "Risk Factors" and in other reports that we file with the SEC.

Many of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of the General Partner's common stock. If the market price of the General Partner's common stock declines, then its shareholders and the Partnership's unitholders, respectively, may be unable to resell their shares and units upon terms that are attractive to them. We cannot assure that the market price of the General Partner's common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the securities markets in general may experience considerable unexpected price and volume fluctuations.

-


-

Our use of joint ventures may negatively impact our jointly-owned investments.

We have, and may continue to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:

•

We could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property;

•

Our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties;

•

Our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues; and

•

Maturities of debt encumbering our jointly owned investments may not be able to be refinanced at all or on terms that are as favorable as the current terms.

Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks.

Our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as computer viruses, computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware or other malicious codes, phishing, employee error or malfeasance, or other unauthorized access. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. Any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.

We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents.  However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable when considering the rapid pace of change in this area.  There can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems will be effective, or that we will be able to maintain our systems free from security breaches, system compromises, misuses of data, or other operational interruptions. Accordingly, we may be unable to prevent major security breaches or entirely mitigate the risk of other system interruptions or failures.

We could also be negatively impacted by similar disruptions to the operations of our vendors or outsourced service providers.

Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders and unitholders could decrease as a result of factors related to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate, many of which are outside of our control.

Our business is subject to the risks incident to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate, many of which involve circumstances not within our control. Such risks include the following:

•

Changes in the general economic climate;

•

The availability of capital on favorable terms, or at all;

•

Increases in interest rates;

-


-

•

Local conditions such as oversupply of property or a reduction in demand;

•

Competition for tenants;

•

Changes in market rental rates;

•

Delay or inability to collect rent from tenants who are bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise unwilling or unable to pay;

•

Difficulty in leasing or re-leasing space quickly or on favorable terms;

•

Costs associated with periodically renovating, repairing and reletting rental space;

•

Our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance on our properties;

•

Our ability to control variable operating costs;

•

Changes in government regulations; and

•

Potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, tax and other laws.

Any one or more of these factors could result in a reduction in our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders and unitholders.

Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from properties decreases.

Our financial results depend on leasing space in our real estate to tenants on terms favorable to us. Our income and funds available for distribution to our shareholders and unitholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot meet their lease obligations to us or we are unable to lease properties on favorable terms. In addition, if a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and we may incur substantial legal costs. Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance costs and our debt service payments, generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment. As a result, we may have a reduction in our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders and unitholders.

Our real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to development.

We continue to selectively develop new properties for rental operations in our existing markets when accretive returns are present. These development activities generally require various government and other approvals, which we may not receive. In addition, we also are subject to the following risks associated with development activities:

•

Unsuccessful development opportunities could result in direct expenses to us;

•

Construction costs could increase as the result of trade disputes and tariffs on goods imported in the United States;

•

Construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated, or possibly unprofitable;

•

Time required to complete the construction of a project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity;

•

Occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable; and

•

Favorable sources to fund our development activities may not be available.

-


-

We may be unsuccessful in operating completed real estate projects.

We face the risk that the real estate projects we develop or acquire will not perform in accordance with our expectations. This risk exists because of factors such as the following:

•

Prices paid for acquired facilities are based upon a series of market judgments; and

•

Costs of any improvements required to bring an acquired facility up to standards to establish the market position intended for that facility might exceed budgeted costs.

As a result, we may develop or acquire projects that are not profitable.

Our investments are concentrated in the industrial sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector.

Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial sector. This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified.

We are exposed to the risks of defaults by tenants.

Any of our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken their financial condition. In the event of default or the insolvency of a significant number of our tenants, we may experience a substantial loss of rental revenue and/or delays in collecting rent and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection, a court could allow the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants became unable to meet their obligations to us, became insolvent or declared bankruptcy.

We may be unable to renew leases or relet space.

When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if our tenants do renew or we are able to relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of renovations, if necessary) may be less favorable than current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space, or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than current rates, then our income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected, especially if we were unable to lease a significant amount of the space vacated by tenants in our properties.

Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our facilities, including property, liability and environmental coverage. We believe this coverage is of the type and amount customarily obtained for real property. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current replacement cost of the damaged assets. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, acts of a governmental authority and other factors also may make it unfeasible to collect insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or destroyed. If an uninsured or underinsured loss occurred, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property, and we would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. We are also subject to the risk that our insurance providers may be unwilling or unable to pay our claims when made.

Our acquisition and disposition activity may lead to long-term dilution.

Our asset strategy is to increase our investment concentration in coastal Tier 1 markets.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our strategy or that our execution of such strategy will lead to improved results.

Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.

From time to time, we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:

•

liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

•

claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;

•

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

•

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

We could be exposed to significant environmental liabilities as a result of conditions of which we currently are not aware.

As an owner and operator of real property, we may be liable under various federal, state and local laws for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous substances. In addition, we could have greater difficulty in selling real estate on which hazardous substances were present or in obtaining borrowings using such real estate as collateral. It is our general policy to have Phase I environmental audits performed for all of our properties and land by qualified environmental consultants at the time of purchase. These Phase I environmental audits have not revealed any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on our business. However, a Phase I environmental audit does not involve invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, and we cannot be sure that the Phase I environmental audits did not fail to reveal a significant environmental liability or that a prior owner did not create a material environmental condition on our properties or land which has not yet been discovered. We could also incur environmental liability as a result of future uses or conditions of such real estate or changes in applicable environmental laws.

We are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate-change related risks.

We are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. We have a significant investment in properties in coastal markets such as Southern California, Northern California and South Florida and have also targeted those markets for future growth.   Those coastal markets have historically experienced severe weather events, such as storms and drought, as well as other natural catastrophes such as wildfires and floods.  If the frequency of extreme weather and other natural events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. We may also be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by stricter energy and water efficiency standards as well as water access for our buildings.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

If the General Partner were to cease to qualify as a REIT, it would lose significant tax benefits.

The General Partner intends to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Qualification as a REIT provides significant tax advantages to the General Partner. However, in order for the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT, it must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. Satisfaction of these requirements also depends on various factual circumstances not

-


-

entirely within our control. The fact that the General Partner holds its assets through the Partnership further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the General Partner's REIT status. Although we believe that the General Partner can continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot offer any assurance that it will continue to do so or that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the qualification requirements or the federal income tax consequences of qualification. If the General Partner were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would have the following effects:

•

The General Partner would not be allowed a deduction for dividends distributed to shareholders and would be subject to federal corporate income tax (and any applicable state and local income taxes) on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates;

•

Unless the General Partner was entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, it would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a REIT;

•

The General Partner's net earnings available for investment or distribution to its shareholders would decrease due to the additional tax liability for the year or years involved; and

•

The General Partner would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders in order to qualify as a REIT.

As such, the General Partner's failure to qualify as a REIT would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of the General Partner's securities and, consequently, the Partnership's Units.

REIT distribution requirements limit the amount of cash we have available for other business purposes, including amounts that we need to fund our future capital needs.

To maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, the General Partner must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. The General Partner intends to continue to make distributions to its shareholders to comply with the 90% distribution requirement. However, this requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital for use for other business purposes. If we do not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements of the General Partner, we may have to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements. If the General Partner fails to satisfy the distribution requirement, it would cease to qualify as a REIT.

U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and investments in REITs may change in a manner that could adversely affect us or shareholders.

Legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect, and may adversely affect us and/or shareholders.

We are subject to certain provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, which may reduce the likelihood of the General Partner's shareholders receiving a control premium for their shares.

Indiana anti-takeover legislation and certain provisions in our governing documents, as we discuss below, may discourage potential acquirers from pursuing a change-of-control transaction with us. As a result, the General Partner's shareholders may be less likely to receive a control premium for their shares.

Ownership Restriction.

Subject to certain exceptions, the General Partner's charter provides that no person or entity may beneficially own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (in value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the General Partner's outstanding common stock or 9.8% in value of its outstanding stock.

-


-

Unissued Preferred Stock.

The General Partner's charter permits its board of directors to classify unissued preferred stock by setting the rights and preferences of the shares at the time of issuance. This power enables the General Partner's board to adopt a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill. Although the General Partner has repealed its previously existing poison pill and its current board of directors has adopted a policy not to adopt a shareholder rights plan without shareholder approval, the General Partner's board can change this policy at any time. The adoption of a poison pill would discourage a potential bidder from acquiring a significant position in the General Partner without the approval of its board.

Business-Combination Provisions of Indiana Law.

The General Partner has not opted out of the business-combination provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law. As a result, potential bidders may have to negotiate with the General Partner's board of directors before acquiring 10% of its stock. Without securing board approval of the proposed business combination before crossing the 10% ownership threshold, a bidder would not be permitted to complete a business combination for five years after becoming a 10% shareholder. Even after the five-year period, a business combination with the significant shareholder would either be required to meet certain per share price minimums as set forth in the Indiana Business Corporation Law or to receive the approval of a majority of the disinterested shareholders.

Control-Share-Acquisition Provisions of Indiana Law.

The General Partner has not opted out of the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law regarding acquisitions of control shares. Therefore, those who acquire a significant block (at least 20%) of the General Partner's shares may only vote a portion of their shares unless its other shareholders vote to accord full voting rights to the acquiring person. Moreover, if the other shareholders vote to give full voting rights with respect to the control shares and the acquiring person has acquired a majority of the General Partner's outstanding shares, the other shareholders would be entitled to special dissenters' rights.

Supermajority Voting Provisions.

The General Partner's charter prohibits business combinations or significant disposition transactions with a holder of 10% of its shares unless:

•

The holders of 80% of the General Partner's outstanding shares of capital stock approve the transaction;

•

The transaction has been approved by three-fourths of those directors who served on the General Partner's board before the shareholder became a 10% owner; or

•

The significant shareholder complies with the "fair price" provisions of the General Partner's charter.

Among the transactions with large shareholders requiring the supermajority shareholder approval are dispositions of assets with a value greater than or equal to $1,000,000 and business combinations.

Operating Partnership Provisions.

The limited partnership agreement of the Partnership contains provisions that could discourage change-of-control transactions, including a requirement that holders of at least 90% of the outstanding Common Units approve:

•

Any voluntary sale, exchange, merger, consolidation or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership in one or more transactions other than a disposition occurring upon a financing or refinancing of the Partnership;

•

The General Partner's merger, consolidation or other business combination with another entity unless after the transaction substantially all of the assets of the surviving entity are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for Common Units;

•

The General Partner's assignment of its interests in the Partnership other than to one of its wholly owned subsidiaries; and

•

Any reclassification or recapitalization or change of outstanding shares of the General Partner's common stock other than certain changes in par value, stock splits, stock dividends or combinations.

-


-

We are dependent on key personnel.

The General Partner's executive officers and other senior officers have a significant role in the success of our Company. Our ability to retain our management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave our Company is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for each of the years in the five-year period ended

December 31, 2019

. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" included in this Form 10-K (in thousands, except per share or per Common Unit data):

(1) Funds from operations ("FFO") is a non-GAAP measure used in the real estate industry and is computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT").  In addition to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, we assess and measure the overall operating results of the General Partner and the Partnership based upon NAREIT FFO, which management believes is a useful indicator of consolidated operating performance. NAREIT FFO is also used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT.

-


-

NAREIT FFO is calculated as net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses on sales of real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business) and related taxes, gains and losses from change in control, impairment charges related to real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business) and similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders. NAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Management believes that the use of NAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders, combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management believes that the use of NAREIT FFO as a performance measure enables investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT's activity and assist them in comparing these operating results between periods or between different companies.

See a reconciliation of NAREIT FFO to net income attributable to common shareholders under "Year in Review" under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." NAREIT-defined reconciling items between net income and NAREIT FFO totaled $104,227 and $(307,979) for the General Partner, and $105,264 and $(311,176) for the Partnership, in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of industrial real estate.

The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations in 1986 and is the sole general partner of the Partnership.  The Partnership is a limited partnership formed in 1993, at which time all of the properties and related assets and liabilities of the General Partner, as well as proceeds from a secondary offering of the General Partner's common shares, were contributed to the Partnership.  Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. We operate the General Partner and the Partnership as one enterprise, and therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to the General Partner and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Partnership, collectively.

At

December 31, 2019

, we:

•

Owned or jointly controlled


primarily industrial properties, of which


properties with

146.4 million

square feet were in service and


properties with

8.9 million

square feet were under development.  The


in-service properties were comprised of


consolidated properties with

135.5 million

square feet and


unconsolidated joint venture properties with

11.0 million

square feet.  The


properties under development consisted of


consolidated properties with

8.7 million

square feet and

one

unconsolidated joint venture property with

133,000

square feet.

•

Owned directly, or through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), approximately 1,380 acres of land and controlled approximately 1,000 acres through purchase options.

Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential.

Operational Strategy

Our operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations as well as NAREIT FFO through (i) maintaining property occupancy and increasing rental rates, while also keeping lease-related capital costs contained, by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing new build-to-suit, substantially pre-leased and, in select markets, speculative development projects; and (iii) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.

-


-

Asset Strategy

Our strategic objectives include (i) increasing our investment in quality industrial properties through development; (ii) acquiring properties primarily in coastal Tier 1 markets which we believe provide the best potential for future rental growth; and (iii) maintaining an optimal land inventory through selected strategic land acquisitions and new development activity. We are continuing to execute our asset strategy through a disciplined approach by identifying development opportunities, identifying select acquisition targets where the asset quality and pricing meet our objectives and continually evaluating our portfolio for disposition by regularly identifying assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives.

Capital Strategy

Our capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure in coordination with the execution of our overall operational and asset strategies. We are focused on maintaining our current investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2019, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Services and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and we are focused on maintaining such ratings in order to maintain access to liquidity. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.

In support of our capital strategy, we employ an asset disposition program to sell non-strategic real estate assets, which generate proceeds that can be recycled into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives or otherwise manage our capital structure.

We continue to focus on maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates; and (iii) issuing common equity as needed to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic developments or acquisitions. With our successes to date and continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we expect to be in a very strong position to be opportunistic in our investment opportunities.

Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Strategy

We are focused on promoting our growth in a sustainable way, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. As part of our vision to continually set the standard for maximizing stakeholder value, we have a long-standing commitment to sustainable practices in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives.  On December 17, 2019, we adopted a Sustainable Development Policy intended to increase the operational efficiency of our buildings and promote sustainable design principles.  We are committed to integrating innovative, sustainable building design features in alignment with U.S. Green Building Council’s

®

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (or LEED

®

), including constructing to LEED

®

criteria and achieving certification in all new developments where feasible.  While we do not control most of the utility usage at our properties, we have been partnering with a third party data management provider since 2018 in order to help monitor and manage the utility usage that we do control.  In 2018, we also became a member of GRESB, a leading provider of real estate ESG benchmarking and performance assessments.  In 2019, as evidence of our commitment and continued progress, we increased our GRESB score significantly, and we expect to continue participating in the GRESB benchmarking assessments.

In October 2018, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board issued the Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard.  The standards are intended to provide a minimum set of sustainability metrics for disclosure in SEC filings, such as this Form 10-K.  We understand the importance of reporting comparable, consistent and financially material sustainability metrics.  Below is a chart showing our information for the applicable metrics.

-


-

In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 2.88%, which mature in November 2029.  These notes represent the first green bond issuance in the United States by an industrial REIT. The net proceeds will be used to finance future or refinance recently completed “Eligible Green Projects”. These projects may include green buildings, energy efficiency projects, sustainable water and wastewater management systems, renewable energy projects, clean transportation solutions and pollution prevention and control.

In addition to our environmental initiatives, we are committed to fair compensation, fostering a dynamic and balanced work environment and providing employees with developmental opportunities to perform well and derive satisfaction from their work.  Among other community service opportunities, we hold an annual day of service during which all employees are encouraged to volunteer in their local communities. We also have charitable contribution programs, such as our dollars for doers program (matching dollars for volunteer hours spent) and our matching gifts program (matching dollars for employee donations to charities). We maintain a formal and structured diversity and inclusion program and have increased diversity within our board of directors, which is now 31% female. Through all of these initiatives and others, we endeavor to make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business.

We strive to maintain an effective corporate governance structure and comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies. Further, we have a public Corporate Responsibility Policy that formally communicates our commitments and leadership around ESG issues.  Please see “Item 1-Corporate Governance” for more information regarding our governance initiatives.

Through all of our environmental, social and governance efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and community, while also benefiting our investors, employees, tenants and the communities in which we operate.

Year in Review

Overall, the economy performed well, with estimated growth in the United States gross domestic product of 2.3% for 2019. There continued to be positive momentum in some key areas, such as labor and consumer spending, but the overall economic environment was also negatively impacted by trade war concerns, gulf tensions and geopolitical matters. Short term and long term interest rates trended down for most of 2019 with the 10 year Treasury rate fluctuating from 1.5% to 2.8% and ending the year at 1.9%, down from 2.7% at the end of 2018. The continued growth of e-commerce and supply chain modernization has continued to be a significant positive factor for the industrial real estate sector, especially in high demand and land-constrained markets, while the issues facing some traditional retail operators have not significantly impacted our business. Under these conditions we were able to execute our asset and capital strategies for the year and had a successful 2019.

As the result of leasing up space in speculative developments throughout 2019, the percentage of total square feet leased for our in-service portfolio of consolidated properties

increased

from

96.4%

at December 31,

square feet in


compared to

24.1 million

square feet in


. The mix in leasing activity between renewals and the leasing of new developments was generally consistent with 2018.

•

Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties in


included

10.9 million

square feet of lease renewals, which represented a

79.1%

retention rate on a square foot basis.  New second generation and renewal leases, on a combined basis, executed for consolidated properties during the year resulted in a

27.3%

increase to net effective rents ("net effective rents" is defined hereafter in the "Key Performance Indicators" section) when compared to the previous leases of the same space.

We utilized the capital generated from dispositions during the year to reduce debt and to fund our development activities.  Highlights of our key financing activities are as follows:

•

During 2019, the General Partner issued

8.0 million

common shares pursuant to its at the market ("ATM") equity programs, generating gross proceeds of

$266.3 million

and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of

$263.3 million

.

•

In November 2019, we issued

$400.0 million

of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a stated interest rate of

2.88%

and mature on November 15, 2029. In connection with this offering, we settled the outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps, which were designated hedges for this offering, for a cash

-


-

payment of $35.6 million.  When including the impact of interest rate swap amortization from accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL"), the effective interest rate on these notes was 3.96%.

•

In October 2019, we redeemed

$250.0 million

of senior unsecured notes, which had a scheduled maturity date of February 2021 and bore a stated interest rate of

3.88%

Supplemental Performance Measures

In addition to NAREIT FFO we use (i) Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ("PNOI") and (ii) Same-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ("SPNOI") as supplemental non-GAAP performance measures.  Management believes that the use of PNOI and SPNOI combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.  The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI and SPNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes.

PNOI and SPNOI each exclude expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP.  Furthermore, these metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis

PNOI is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items. As a performance metric that consists of only the cash-based revenues and expenses directly related to ongoing real estate rental operations, PNOI is narrower in scope than NAREIT FFO.

PNOI, as we calculate it, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled, but differently calculated, measures for other REITs. We believe that PNOI is another useful supplemental performance measure, as it is an input in many REIT valuation models and it provides a means by which to evaluate the performance of the properties within our Rental Operations segments. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations (our residual non-industrial properties that have not yet been sold, referred to throughout as "Non-Reportable"), are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations."

The major factors influencing PNOI are occupancy levels, acquisitions and sales, development properties that achieve stabilized operations, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses.

Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report shows a calculation of our PNOI for the years ended December 31,


,


and


and provides a reconciliation of PNOI for our Rental Operations segments to income from continuing operations before income taxes.

Same-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis

We also evaluate the performance of our properties, including our share of properties we jointly control, on a "same-property" basis, using a metric referred to as SPNOI.  We view SPNOI as a useful supplemental performance measure because it improves comparability between periods by eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our portfolio.

-


-

On an individual property basis, SPNOI is generally computed in a consistent manner as PNOI.

Effective January 1, 2018, we define our "same-property" population once a year at the beginning of the current calendar year and include buildings that were stabilized (the term "stabilized" means properties that have reached 90% leased or that have been in-service for at least one year since development completion or acquisition) as of January 1 of the prior calendar year. The "same-property" pool is also adjusted to remove properties that were sold subsequent to the beginning of the current calendar year. As such, the "same-property" population for the period ended December 31, 2019 includes all properties that we owned or jointly controlled at January 1, 2019, which had both been owned or jointly controlled and had reached stabilization by January 1, 2018, and have not been sold.

A reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes to SPNOI is presented as follows (in thousands, except percentage data):

The composition of the line items titled "Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI" and "Non-Segment Items" from the table above are shown in greater detail in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.

We believe that the factors that impact SPNOI are generally the same as those that impact PNOI.  The following table details the number of properties, square feet, average commencement occupancy and average cash rental rate for the properties included in SPNOI for the respective periods:

Key Performance Indicators

Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our Rental Operations. The following discussion highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider to be critical drivers of future revenues.

Occupancy Analysis

Our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue. The following table sets forth percent leased and average net effective rent information regarding our in-service portfolio of rental properties at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively:

The

increase

in occupancy at

December 31, 2019

within our industrial portfolio, when compared to

December 31, 2018

, primarily resulted from leasing up recently delivered speculative developments while renewing or backfilling existing leases to maintain the occupancy level within our existing base of properties.

Vacancy Activity

The following table sets forth vacancy activity, shown in square feet, from our in-service rental properties for the year ended

December 31, 2019

(in thousands):

-


-

Total Leasing Activity

The initial leasing of development projects or vacant space in acquired properties is referred to as first generation lease activity. Our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates and net effective rents primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re-lease expiring space. The leasing of such space that we have previously held under lease to a tenant is referred to as second generation lease activity. Second generation lease activity may be in the form of renewals of existing leases or new second generation leases of previously leased space. The total leasing activity for our consolidated and unconsolidated rental properties, expressed in square feet of leases signed, is as follows for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


(in thousands):

Second Generation Leases

Lease Expirations

The table below reflects our consolidated in-service portfolio lease expiration schedule, at

December 31, 2019

(in thousands, except percentage data and number of leases):

Building Acquisitions

Our decision process in determining whether or not to acquire a property or portfolio of properties involves several factors, including expected rent growth, multiple yield metrics, property locations and expected demographic growth in each location, current occupancy of the properties, tenant profile and remaining terms of the in-place leases in the properties. We pursue both brokered and non-brokered acquisitions, and it is difficult to predict which markets may present acquisition opportunities that align with our strategy. Because of the numerous factors considered in our acquisition decisions, we do not establish specific target yields for future acquisitions.

We acquired

six

buildings during the year ended

December 31, 2019

and

nine

buildings during the year ended

December 31, 2018

. The following table summarizes the acquisition price, percent leased at time of acquisition and in-place yields, by product type, for these acquisitions (in thousands, except percentage data):

Building Dispositions

We regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans.

We sold


consolidated buildings during the year ended

and


consolidated buildings during the year ended

December 31, 2018

. The following table summarizes the sales prices, in-place yields and percent leased, by product type, of these buildings (in thousands, except percentage data):

Development

Another source of our earnings growth is our consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture development activities. We expect to generate future earnings from Rental Operations as the development properties are placed in service and leased.

We had

8.9 million

square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of

$1.06 billion

at December 31,


compared to 9.5 million square feet with total estimated costs upon completion of $814.1 million at December 31,

Comparison of Year Ended December 31,


to Year Ended December 31,


Rental and Related Revenue

The following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

The primary reasons for the

increase

in rental and related revenue from continuing operations were:

•

We acquired 15 properties and placed 37 developments in service from January 1,


to

December 31, 2019

, which provided incremental revenues from continuing operations of $65.8 million in the year ended

December 31, 2019

when compared to


.

•

Increased rental rates and, to a lesser extent, occupancy within our "same-property" portfolio, as well as the lease up of properties that were placed in service prior to January 1, 2018 but were not in the "same-property" portfolio, also contributed to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations. Average rental rates and commencement occupancy in our "same-property" portfolio both increased from the year ended December 31, 2018.

•

The sale of 43 in-service properties since January 1,


, which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, resulted in a decrease of $21.3 million to rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended

December 31, 2019

, as compared to


, which partially offset the aforementioned increases to rental and related revenue from continuing operations.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

-


-

Overall, rental expenses from continuing operations

increased

by

$4.1 million

in


compared to


.  The increase to rental expenses was primarily the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Overall, real estate tax expense from continuing operations

increased

by

$4.3 million

in


compared to


.  The increase to real estate taxes was mainly the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1,


to

December 31, 2019

and increased real estate taxes levied by the related taxing authority. The increases were partially offset by the impact of an accounting requirement that became effective in 2019, which no  longer allows reporting revenues and expenses for real estate taxes paid by tenants directly to taxing authorities, as well as the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Service Operations

The following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively (in thousands):

Service Operations primarily consist of the leasing, property management, asset management, development, construction management and general contractor services for unconsolidated joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. Service Operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy, while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners and joint venture partners.

Net earnings from service operations decreased as the result of lower third party general contractor construction volume during 2019.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations was

$327.2 million

and

$312.2 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended

December 31, 2019

was primarily the result of continued growth in our portfolio through development and acquisition.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that generally own and operate rental properties.  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was

$31.4 million

and

$21.4 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

In


, we recorded equity in earnings of $19.4 million related to our share of the gain on sale of five unconsolidated joint venture buildings and equity in earnings of $1.3 million representing our share of gains on involuntary conversion from insurance recoveries related to storm damage in one unconsolidated joint venture.

In


, we recorded equity in earnings of $12.1 million related to our share of the gain on sale of six unconsolidated joint venture buildings, as well as the gain on sale of our ownership interest in one unconsolidated joint venture and equity in earnings of $3.9 million representing our share of gains on involuntary conversion from insurance recoveries related to storm damage in one unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by a $2.2 million  impairment charge for one unconsolidated joint venture.

Gain on Sale of Properties - Continuing Operations

We sold


properties during


that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of

$234.7 million

. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

We sold


properties during

Gain on Sale of Land

Gain on sale of land was

$7.4 million

and

$10.3 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.  We sold 110 acres of undeveloped land in


compared to 187 acres of undeveloped land in


.

Non-Incremental Costs Related to Successful Leases

As the result of adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report),

$12.4 million

of non-incremental costs related to successful leases were expensed during 2019. As we have adopted the standard on a prospective basis, there was no adjustment to non-incremental costs previously capitalized for 2018.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist of two components.  The first component includes general corporate expenses, and the second component represents the indirect operating costs not allocated to, or absorbed by, either the development, leasing and operation of our consolidated properties or our Service Operations.  Such indirect operating costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation, including related costs such as benefits and wage-related taxes, but also include other ancillary costs such as travel and information technology support.  Total indirect operating costs, prior to any allocation or absorption, and general corporate expenses are collectively referred to as our overall pool of overhead costs.

Those indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses.  We regularly review our total overhead cost structure relative to our leasing, development and construction volume and adjust the level of total overhead, generally through changes in our level of staffing in various functional departments, as necessary, in order to control overall general and administrative expense.

General and administrative expenses were

$60.9 million

and

$56.2 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from


to


(in millions):

(1)  We capitalized

$6.8 million

and

$24.2 million

of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during


, compared to capitalizing

$19.0 million

and

$29.8 million

of such costs, respectively, for


.  Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled

22.8%

and

35.1%

of our overall pool of overhead costs for


and


, respectively. The decrease in overhead costs capitalized to leasing was primarily due to

$12.4 million

of previously capitalizable internal costs that were immediately expensed due to the adoption of a new lease accounting requirement in 2019 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report) and presented separately in the line item "Non-incremental costs related to successful leases" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

-

Interest Expense

Interest expense allocable to continuing operations was

$89.8 million

and

$85.0 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. The increase in interest expense from continuing operations for the year ended

December 31, 2019

was largely the result of increased overall borrowings, partially offset by lower average interest rates.

We capitalized

$26.5 million

and

$27.2 million

of interest costs during


and


, respectively.

Debt Extinguishment

During 2019, we redeemed $250.0 million of unsecured notes, which had a stated interest rate of 3.88%. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of

$6.3 million

, which included a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

During 2018, we repaid three secured loans, totaling $227.1 million, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of 7.62%. We also repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt, which had a stated interest rate of 6.26%. We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $388,000 from these transactions including a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31,


to Year Ended December 31,


Rental and Related Revenue

The following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

The primary reasons for the

increase

in rental and related revenue from continuing operations were:

•

The acquisition of 36 properties and placing of 41 developments in service from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 provided combined incremental revenues of $106.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017.

•

Increased occupancy and rental rates within our "same-property" portfolio also contributed to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations. Average commencement occupancy and rental rates in our "same-property" portfolio both increased, as compared to 2017.

•

Expense reimbursements increased primarily due to increased real estate taxes in our existing properties, as compared to 2017.

•

The above items contributing to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations were partially offset by the sale of 28 in-service properties since January 1, 2017, which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, and resulted in a $35.7 million decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017.

Rental and related revenue from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased compared to 2017 as the result of the properties classified within discontinued operations being sold throughout 2017.

-


-

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes

The following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

Overall, rental expenses from continuing operations increased by $8.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017.  The increase to rental expenses was primarily the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Real estate tax expense from continuing operations increased by $16.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017.  The increase to real estate taxes was mainly the result of acquisitions and developments placed in services from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 and an increase in real estate taxes on our existing base of properties.  These increases to real estate tax expense were partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

The decreases in both rental expenses and real estate tax expense from discontinued operations were a result of the properties classified within discontinued operations being sold throughout 2017.

Service Operations

The following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively (in thousands):

Net earnings from service operations increased as the result of a higher volume of third party construction projects during 2018.

-


-

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations was $312.2 million and $273.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily the result of properties acquired and the developments placed in service from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018.  The impact of acquired properties and developments placed in service was partially offset by property dispositions that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $21.4 million and $63.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

In 2018, we recorded equity in earnings of $12.1 million related to our share of the gain on sale of six unconsolidated joint venture buildings, as well as the gain on sale of our ownership interest in one unconsolidated joint venture and equity in earnings of $3.9 million representing our share of gains on involuntary conversion from insurance recoveries related to storm damage in one unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by a $2.2 million  impairment charge for one unconsolidated joint venture.

In 2017, we recorded $53.9 million to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures as the result of the gains on sale of our ownership interests in four unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as our share of the gain on the sale of one property from an unconsolidated joint venture.  These transactions included $47.5 million in gains from the sale of our ownership interests in two joint ventures in connection with the sale of our medical office portfolio (the "Medical Office Portfolio Disposition").

Promote Income

We recognized $20.0 million of promote income from the sale of our interest in one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, during the year ended December 31, 2017. We did not recognize any promote income during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Gain on Sale of Properties - Continuing Operations

We sold 15 properties during 2018 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $205.0 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

We sold 17 properties during 2017 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $113.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Gain on Sale of Land

Gain on sale of land was $10.3 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  We sold 187 acres of undeveloped land in 2018 compared to 166 acres of undeveloped land in 2017.

-

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses were $56.2 million and $54.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2017 to 2018 (in millions):

(1)  We capitalized $19.0 million and $29.8 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during 2018, compared to capitalizing $19.1 million and $31.5 million of such costs, respectively, for 2017.  Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 35.1% and 36.2% of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Interest Expense

Interest expense allocable to continuing operations was $85.0 million and $87.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in interest expense from continuing operations was largely the result of higher capitalization of interest due to an overall increase in development activities.  We capitalized $27.2 million of interest costs during 2018 compared to $18.9 million during 2017. No interest expense was classified within discontinued operations in 2018.

During 2017, $14.7 million of interest expense was classified within discontinued operations.

Debt Extinguishment

During 2018, we repaid three secured loans, totaling $227.1 million, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of 7.62%. We also repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt, which had a stated interest rate of 6.26%. We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $388,000 from these transactions including a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

During 2017, we repaid our $250.0 million variable rate term loan, which had a scheduled maturity date of January 2019 and bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%.  We also repaid $285.6 million of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of January 2018 and $128.7 million of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of March 2020.  We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $26.1 million from these transactions during the year ended 2017, which included prepayment premiums and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Discontinued Operations

The property-specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes, allocated interest expense and depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss on the disposition of the properties and related income tax expense.

The Medical Office Portfolio Disposition in 2017 was comprised of


medical office properties which were classified as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,


.  As a result, we classified operating income before gain on sales and income taxes of

$18.4 million

and gain on sales of properties of

$1.36 billion

in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,


.  The related income tax impact, totaling

$12.5 million

for the year ended December 31, 2017, was also reported in discontinued operations. There were no properties classified as held-for-sale and included in discontinued operations at December 31, 2018.

Discontinued operations is further discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience.  Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:

Cost Capitalization

: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We capitalize all such costs through the completion of the building shell. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.

We also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods, after construction of the building shell has been completed, if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.

Effective on January 1, 2019, with the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842,

Leases

("ASC 842"), only costs that are directly incremental to executing a lease are capitalized.

In assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction and development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions, dispositions, non-incremental leasing costs and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.

To ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized construction and development costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards are based on a percentage of the total development costs of a project. These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects are not capitalized.

Impairment of Real Estate Assets:

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of

-


-

our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset's undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.

To the extent applicable marketplace data is available, we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired.

Real estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

Acquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets:

We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant.  This “as-if vacant” value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties.  The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, estimated market rents and the fair value of the underlying land.

The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases.

•

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

•

Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical lease up periods, related to space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition.  These estimates include (i) lost rent at market rates, (ii) fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and (iii) theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.

To the extent that we gain control of real estate properties that are accounted for as asset acquisitions, as opposed to business combinations, we accumulate the costs of pre-existing equity interest and the consideration paid for additional interest acquired and do not remeasure our pre-existing equity interest. Generally contingencies arising from an asset acquisition are only recognized when the contingency is paid or becomes payable.

-


-

To the extent that we gain control of a property acquired that meets the definition of a business, we account for the acquisition in accordance with the guidance for step acquisitions at their full fair value and record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our existing equity interest. Additionally, contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.

The audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months, including payments of dividends and distributions and the capital expenditures needed to maintain our current real estate assets, primarily through working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We had no outstanding borrowings on the Partnership's $1.20 billion unsecured line of credit, had

$110.9 million

of cash on hand and held

$1.7 million

of restricted cash for future like kind exchange transactions at

December 31, 2019

.  At

December 31, 2019

, we also held $110.0 million of notes receivable from the 2017 Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, which matured and was paid in full in January 2020.

In addition to our existing sources of liquidity, we expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and other capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow, proceeds from property dispositions and accessing the public debt and equity markets.

Rental Operations

Cash flows from Rental Operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable source of cash flow to fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for items such as periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of, or a short time following, the actual revenue recognition.

We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and bankruptcies and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, any of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations.

Unsecured Debt and Equity Securities

Our unsecured line of credit at

December 31, 2019

is described as follows (in thousands):

The Partnership's unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of

$1.20 billion

, with an interest rate on borrowings of LIBOR plus

0.875%

and a maturity date of

January 2022

, with options to extend until January 30, 2023.  Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional

$800.0 million

, for a total of up to

$2.00 billion

.  This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At

December 31, 2019

, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

-


-

In 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC") proposed that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate ("SOFR") replace LIBOR. ARRC also proposed that the transition to SOFR from LIBOR take place by the end of 2021. As the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement has provisions that allow for automatic transition to a new rate, the Partnership has no other material debt arrangements that are indexed to LIBOR, and has settled all outstanding interest rate swaps in November 2019, we believe that the transition will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

At

December 31, 2019

, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities (including guarantees of the Partnership's debt securities by the General Partner). Equity securities are offered and sold by the General Partner, and the net proceeds of such offerings are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units or Preferred Units. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes.

On August 1, 2019, the General Partner and the Partnership terminated the equity distribution agreement for the ATM equity program with an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 million. Prior to the termination, the General Partner issued 1.8 million common shares in


pursuant to its previous ATM equity program, resulting in net proceeds of $56.3 million after paying total compensation of $568,000 to the applicable sales agents.  On August 2, 2019, the General Partner and the Partnership entered into a new equity distribution agreement to sell shares of the General Partner’s common stock, $0.01 par value per share, from time to time, up to an aggregate offering price of $400.0 million. Pursuant to the new ATM equity program, the General Partner issued a total of 6.2 million common shares during 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $207.3 million after paying total compensation of $2.1 million to the applicable sales agents. Of the total activity in 2019 under the new ATM program, 1.4 million common shares were issued during the three months ended December 31, 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $47.7 million after paying total compensation of $482,000 to the applicable sales agents. Other fees related to all 2019 issuances, totaling $325,000, were also paid during 2019. The issuances resulted in net proceeds of $263.3 million under both ATM programs during 2019.

In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 2.88%, have an effective interest rate of 3.96% when including the impact of interest rate swap amortization from AOCL, and mature on November 15, 2029, for gross proceeds of $399.9 million.

In August 2019, we issued $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.38%, have an effective interest of 2.80%, and mature on December 15, 2027, for gross proceeds of $182.3 million.

The Partnership has issued debt securities pursuant to certain indentures and related supplemental indentures, which also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants, as well as applicable covenants under our unsecured line of credit, at

December 31, 2019

.

Sale of Real Estate Assets

We regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of non-strategic properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. Although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non-strategic properties, potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties.

Sales of land and depreciable properties provided

$432.7 million

in net proceeds in


, compared to

$511.4 million

in


and

$2.52 billion

in


. We also held $110.0 million of notes receivable related to the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition at December 31, 2019, which matured and was paid in full in January 2020.

Transactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Transactions with unconsolidated joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity.  From time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated joint ventures, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own.  Additionally, unconsolidated joint ventures will from time to time obtain debt financing or sell properties and will then distribute to us, and our joint venture partners, all or a portion of the proceeds from such transactions. During


, our share of sale and capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures totaled

$26.3 million

.

Uses of Liquidity

Our principal uses of liquidity include the following:

•

property investment;

•

leasing/capital costs;

•

dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;

•

long-term debt maturities;

•

opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt; and

•

other contractual obligations.

Property Investment

Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties, primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential. Pursuant to this strategy, we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon our market outlook, including general economic conditions, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, and our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity, including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties.

Leasing/Capital Costs

Tenant improvements and lease-related costs pertaining to our initial leasing of newly completed space, or vacant space in acquired properties, are referred to as first generation expenditures. Such first generation expenditures for tenant improvements are included within "development of real estate investments" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while such expenditures for capitalizable lease-related costs are included within "other deferred leasing costs."

Cash expenditures related to the construction of a building's shell, as well as the associated site improvements, are also included within "development of real estate investments" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Tenant improvements and leasing costs to renew or re-let rental space that we previously leased to tenants for second generation leases are referred to as second generation expenditures.  Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant, but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties, are also second generation expenditures.  One of the principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments.

-


-

The following table summarizes our second generation capital expenditures by type of expenditure, as well as capital expenditures for the development of real estate investments and for other deferred leasing costs (in thousands):

We had consolidated properties under development with an expected total cost of

$1.05 billion

at

December 31, 2019

, compared to projects with an expected cost of $709.7 million and $642.1 million at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.

The capital expenditures in the table above include the capitalization of internal overhead costs.  We capitalized

$6.8 million

,

$19.0 million

and

$19.1 million

of overhead costs related to leasing activities, including both first and second generation leases, during the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.  We capitalized

$24.2 million

,

$29.8 million

and

$31.5 million

of overhead costs related to development activities, including both development and tenant improvement projects on first and second generation space, during the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.  Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled

22.8%

,

35.1%

and

36.2%

of our overall pool of overhead costs at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively. The decrease in the overhead costs capitalized to leasing for 2019 was primarily due to the expense impact of internal costs related to successful leasing which were not capitalizable as a result of the adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report) and was included in the line item "Non-incremental costs related to successful leases" on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for 2019.

Further discussion of the capitalization of overhead costs can be found in the year-to-year comparisons of general and administrative expenses and Critical Accounting Policies sections of this Item 7.

In addition to the capitalization of overhead costs, the totals for development of real estate assets in the table above include the capitalization of

$26.5 million

,

$27.2 million

and

$18.9 million

of interest costs in the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.

Both our first and second generation expenditures vary significantly between leases on a per square foot basis, dependent upon several factors including the product type, the nature of a tenant's operations, the specific physical characteristics of each individual property and the market in which the property is located.

Dividend and Distribution Requirements

The General Partner is required to meet the distribution requirements of the Code in order to maintain its REIT status. We paid regular dividends or distributions of

$0.88

, $0.815 and $0.77 per common share or Common Unit for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.  We also paid a special dividend of $0.85 per common share or Common Unit during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the significant taxable gains on asset sales completed in that year.

We expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings, to meet the requirements to maintain the General Partner's REIT status, and additional amounts as determined by the General Partner's board of directors. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the General Partner's board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as the General Partner's board of directors deems relevant.

Debt Maturities

Debt outstanding at

December 31, 2019

had a face value totaling

$2.93 billion

with a weighted average interest rate of

3.73%

and maturities at various dates through 2029. Of this total amount, we had

$2.90 billion

of unsecured debt,

$34.1 million

of secured debt and no outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit at

December 31, 2019

.  Scheduled principal amortization, maturities and early repayments of such debt totaled

$325.5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

The following table is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at

December 31, 2019

(in thousands, except percentage data):

We anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from our Rental Operations and property dispositions and by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions.

Repayments of Outstanding Debt

To the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy, we may purchase or redeem some of our outstanding unsecured notes prior to their stated maturities.

During 2019, we repaid three fixed rate secured loans, totaling $41.7 million, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of 7.76%.

In October 2019, we redeemed $250.0 million of unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2021.

Guarantee Obligations

We are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments.

Historical Cash Flows

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were

$121.4 million

,

$25.5 million

and

$193.6 million

at

December 31, 2019

,


, and


, respectively. The following table highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet our operational requirements and the receipt of rental income from Rental Operations continues to be our primary source of operating cash flows. The increase to net cash provided by operating activities, compared to 2018, was due to the timing of cash receipts and cash payments on third party construction projects as well as increased cash flows from our Rental Operations.  These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by increased cash paid for interest and income taxes as well as the timing of working capital.

The increase to cash flow provided by operating activities between 2017 and 2018 was the result of higher cash flows from rental operations and lower cash paid for interest, partially offset by a $20.0 million promote payment received in connection with the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition during 2017.

Investing Activities

Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:

•

Real estate development costs were

$446.8 million

,

$577.4 million

, and

$549.6 million

during

Financing Activities

The following items highlight significant capital transactions:

•

During 2019, the General Partner issued

8.0 million

common shares pursuant to its ATM equity programs for net proceeds of

$263.3 million

, compared to

990,400

shares of common stock for net proceeds of

$28.4 million

in


.  The General Partner did not issue any shares of common stock pursuant to its ATM equity programs during 2017.

•

We issued $575.0 million, $450.0 million and $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2019 unsecured debt issuances consist of $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in August 2019 for gross proceeds of $182.3 million and $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in November 2019 with a corresponding cash payment of $35.6 million for termination of the five forward starting interest rate swaps entered in 2018 and 2019.

•

During 2019, the Partnership paid cash of

$255.8 million

for the early redemption of $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2021. During 2018, the Partnership repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt. In 2017, the Partnership paid cash of $689.6 million to execute the repayment of a $250.0 million variable rate term loan, which was prepayable without penalty, and the early redemption of $414.3 million of senior unsecured notes.

•

During 2019, the Partnership repaid

three

secured loans for

$41.7 million

compared to repayments of three secured loans for $227.1 million in 2018 and eight secured loans for $66.5 million in 2017.

•

We decreased net borrowings on the Partnership's unsecured line of credit by

$30.0 million

in


,

increased

net borrowings by

•

We paid regular cash dividends or distributions of

$0.88

, $0.815 and $0.77 per common share or per Common Unit during the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.

•

We paid a special dividend of $0.85 per common share or Common Unit during the fourth quarter of 2017. We did not pay special dividends in 2019 or 2018.

•

Changes in book cash overdrafts are classified as financing activities within our consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Book cash overdrafts were $14.4 million, $14.3 million and $36.3 million at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.

•

In 2019, we paid off a special assessment bond for $9.9 million, which was reflected within Other Financing Activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We did not make similar significant repayments during 2018 or 2017.

Impact of Changes in Credit Ratings on Our Liquidity

We are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group.  Our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service, upgraded in 2016 from Baa2.  In addition, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, upgraded in 2016 from BBB. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.

The ratings of our senior unsecured notes could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

We have equity interests in unconsolidated partnerships and limited liability companies that primarily own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. These unconsolidated joint ventures are primarily engaged in the operation and development of industrial real estate properties. These investments provide us with increased market share and tenant and property diversification. The equity method of accounting is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies.  As a result, the assets and liabilities of these entities are not included on our balance sheet.

Our investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures represented approximately

2%

and

1%

of our total assets at

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, respectively.  We believe that these investments provide several benefits to us, including increased market share, tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects.

The following table presents summarized financial information for unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated joint ventures or financial partnerships that have been established solely for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual Obligations

At

December 31, 2019

, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the following table:

(1)

Our long-term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest.  Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at

December 31, 2019

.

-


-

(2)

Represents fees on our unsecured line of credit, which has a contractual maturity date in

January 2022

, with two six-month extension options, which we may exercise at our discretion.

(3)

Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at

December 31, 2019

.

(4)

Due to a new accounting standard effective January 1, 2019, as a lessee we are required to record both a right-of-use asset and lease liability for our ground and office space leases that we expect to approximate the present value of our future minimum lease payments at December 31, 2019. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(5)

Represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of owned development projects and third-party construction projects.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long-term borrowings. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts (in thousands) of the expected annual maturities, weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period and fair values (in thousands).

As the above table incorporates only those exposures that existed at

December 31, 2019

, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, the ultimate impact of interest rate fluctuations will depend on future exposures that arise, our hedging strategies at that time, to the extent we are party to interest rate derivatives, and interest rates. Interest expense on our unsecured line of credit, to the extent we have outstanding borrowings, will be affected by fluctuations in the LIBOR indices or applicable replacement rates as well as changes in our credit rating. The interest rate at such point in the future as we may renew, extend or replace our unsecured line of credit will be heavily dependent upon the state of the credit environment.

At

December 31, 2019

, the face value of our unsecured debt was $2.90 billion and we estimated the fair value of that unsecured debt to be $3.05 billion.  At December 31, 2018, the face value of our unsecured debt was $2.58 billion and we estimated the fair value of that unsecured debt to be $2.55 billion.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our "disclosure controls and procedures" as of the end of the period covered by this Report. The controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.

Attached as exhibits to this Report are certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  This Controls and Procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on the disclosure controls and procedures evaluation referenced above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting and the audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm are included in Item 15 of Part IV under the headings "Management's Report on Internal Control" and "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm," respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

In August 2019, the General Partner completed implementation of the first phase of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which is designed to replace certain internal financial and operating systems. In connection with the ERP implementation, in August 2019, we updated the processes and controls that comprise our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate related changes to our accounting procedures and business processes.

Management's Report on Internal Control

We, as management of Duke Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "General Partner"), are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of

December 31, 2019

, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.

The independent registered public accounting firm of KPMG LLP, as auditors of the General Partner's consolidated financial statements, has also issued an audit report on the General Partner's internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

Duke Realty Corporation:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Realty Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III - real estate and accumulated depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

December 31, 2019

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Evaluation of real estate assets for potential impairment

As discussed in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, real estate assets, less accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2019, was $6,512,916 thousand, or 77.3% of total assets. The Company evaluates its real estate assets for potential impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the value of real estate assets may not be recoverable, and on at least an annual basis.

We identified the evaluation of real estate assets for potential impairment as a critical audit matter. The Company’s assumptions regarding the changes in property operating forecasts, forecasted rental rates and market conditions, involve a high degree of auditor judgment. The key assumptions included occupancy levels, rental rates, capitalization rates and anticipated holding periods when evaluating real estate assets for potential impairment.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s process to evaluate real estate assets for potential impairment, including controls related to operating forecasts, forecasted rental rates, and certain market conditions. We performed sensitivity analyses over the capitalization rate assumption, based on third-party market data, to assess its impact on the Company’s determination of whether a triggering event had occurred. We compared the Company’s historical property operating forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast occupancy levels and rental rates. We compared the Company’s historical hold period for similar assets to the holding period assumed in the Company’s analysis. We inquired of Company officials and inspected documents such as meeting minutes of the investment committee to evaluate the likelihood that it was more-likely-than not that a property would be sold before the end of its previously estimated holding period. We performed an independent assessment of changes in property operating metrics and market conditions related to individual real estate assets and compared the results of our assessment to the Company’s analysis.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)

The Company

The

General Partner was formed in 1985, and we believe that it qualifies as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. The Partnership was formed on October 4, 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972.

The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning approximately

99.2

%

of the Common Units at

December 31, 2019

. The remaining

0.8

%

of the Common Units are owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Partnership, the General Partner has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Partnership. The General Partner and the Partnership are operated as one enterprise. The management of the General Partner consists of the same members as the management of the Partnership. As the sole general partner with control of the Partnership, the General Partner consolidates the Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same.

Limited partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we owned and operated a portfolio primarily consisting of industrial properties and provided real estate services to third-party owners.

Substantially all of our Rental Operations (see Note 9) are conducted through the Partnership. We conduct our Service Operations (see Note 9) through Duke Realty Services, LLC, Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited Partnership ("DCLP"), which are consolidated entities that are 100% owned by a combination of the General Partner and the Partnership. DCLP is owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. The equity interests in these controlled subsidiaries not owned by us are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Investments in entities that we do not control, and variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which we are not the primary beneficiary (to the extent applicable), are not consolidated and are reflected as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of reporting.

Due to the fact that the Limited Partners do not have kick out rights, or substantive participating rights, the Partnership is a VIE.  Because the General Partner holds majority ownership and exercises control over every aspect of the Partnership's operations, the General Partner has been determined as the primary beneficiary of the Partnership and, therefore, consolidates the Partnership.

The assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same, as the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the


consolidated financial statement presentation.

Real Estate Investments

Rental real property, including land, land improvements, buildings and tenant improvements, are included in real estate investments and are generally stated at cost. Construction in process and undeveloped land are included in real estate investments and are stated at cost. Real estate investments also include our equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development.

Depreciation

Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated lives not to exceed


and


years, respectively, for properties that we develop, and not to exceed


and


years, respectively, for acquired properties. Tenant improvement costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or term of the related lease.

Cost Capitalization

Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. Direct costs include all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals. We capitalize a portion of our indirect costs associated with our construction and development efforts. In assessing the amount of direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. We do not capitalize any costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects.

Effective on January 1, 2019, only costs that are incremental to executing a lease are capitalizable.  Prior to January 1, 2019, we capitalized a portion of our indirect costs associated with our leasing efforts based on the amount of time spent on leasing activities.

We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In addition, we capitalize costs, including real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, that have been allocated to vacant space based on the square footage of the portion of the building not held available for immediate occupancy during the extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized.

We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods when significant activities have ceased, which does not exceed the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains


%

occupancy.

Impairment

We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.

The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. We utilize marketplace participant assumptions to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is required to be measured. The estimation of future cash flows, as well as the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach, are highly subjective measures in estimating fair value.

Real estate assets classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Once a property is designated as held-for-sale, no further depreciation expense is recorded.

Purchase Accounting

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,

Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business

. ASU 2017-01 provides guidance to determine when an acquisition meets the definition of a business or should be accounted for as an asset acquisition, resulting in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions as opposed to business combinations. Transaction costs are capitalized for asset acquisitions while they are expensed as incurred for business combinations. ASU 2017-01 requires that when substantially all of the fair value of an acquisition is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets it does not meet the definition of a business. ASU 2017-01 also revised the definition of a business to include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output.  We early adopted ASU 2017-01 prospectively as of January 1, 2017 as permitted under the standard, which has not had a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

As a result of adoption of ASU 2017-01, our acquisitions of properties have been accounted for as asset acquisitions as they have not met the definition of a business. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized.  To the extent that an acquired property meets the definition of a business, we expense acquisition related costs immediately as period costs.

To the extent that we gain control of real estate properties that are accounted for as asset acquisitions, as opposed to business combinations, we accumulate the costs of pre-existing equity interest and consideration paid for additional interest acquired and we do not remeasure our pre-existing equity interest. Generally contingencies arising from an asset acquisition are only recognized when the contingency is paid or becomes payable.

We allocate the purchase price of asset acquisitions that meet the definition of a business to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. Capitalized acquisition costs are also included in the total cost basis of acquired properties that are asset acquisitions. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant. This “as-if vacant” value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties.  The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, estimated market rents and the fair value of the underlying land. The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases.

The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

-


-

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, of space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition, of lost rent at market rates, fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.

Joint Ventures

We have equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that primarily own and operate rental properties or hold land for development. We consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is considered a VIE and would require consolidation. We (i) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity investment at risk, (ii) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group and whether there are limited partners (or similar owning entities) that lack substantive participating or kick out rights, guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (iii) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this VIE determination.

To the extent that we own interests in a VIE and we (i) have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) have the obligation or rights to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, then we would be determined to be the primary beneficiary and would consolidate the VIE.  To the extent that we own interests in a VIE, then at each reporting period, we re-assess our conclusions as to which, if any, party within the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary. Consolidated joint ventures that are VIEs are not significant in any period presented in these consolidated financial statements.

To the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as VIEs, they are consolidated if we control them through majority ownership interests or if we are the managing entity (general partner or managing member) and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by our ability to unilaterally make significant operating decisions, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the non-managing entity and the inability of the non-managing entity to remove us from our role as the managing entity.  Consolidated joint ventures that are not VIEs are not significant in any period presented in these consolidated financial statements.

We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we exercise significant influence but do not have control. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet.

To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. We recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner's interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.

When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary.  If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value.

There were no unconsolidated joint ventures, in which we have any recognized assets or liabilities or have retained any economic exposure to loss at

December 31, 2019

that met the criteria to be considered VIEs.

Cash Equivalents

Investments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Valuation of Receivables

Upon the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, our determination of the adequacy of our allowances for tenant receivables includes a binary assessment of whether or not the amounts due under a tenant’s lease agreement are probable of collection. For such amounts that are deemed probable of collection, revenue continues to be recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For such amounts that are deemed not probable of collection, revenue is recorded as the lesser of (i) the amount which would be recognized on a straight-line basis or (ii) cash that has been received from the tenant, with any tenant and deferred rent receivable balances charged as a direct write-off against rental income in the period of the change in the collectability determination.

Deferred Costs

Deferred Financing Costs

Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are deferred and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related loan. The costs for issuing debt, other than lines of credit, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the debt's carrying value, while debt issuance costs related to the Partnership's unsecured line of credit are presented as assets in the consolidated balance sheets, as part of other escrow deposits and other assets.

Lease Related Costs and Acquired Lease-Related Intangible Assets

Effective on January 1, 2019, only costs that are directly incremental to executing a lease are capitalized. Prior to January 1, 2019, all direct and indirect costs, including estimated internal costs, associated with the leasing of real estate investments owned by us were capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease.

Acquired lease-related intangible assets consist of above market lease assets and the value allocable to in-place leases. Above market lease assets are amortized as a reduction to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. In-place lease intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and included within depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The expected future amortization, or charge to rental income, of acquired lease-related intangible assets is summarized in the table below (in thousands):

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests relate to the minority ownership interests in the Partnership and interests in consolidated property partnerships that are not wholly owned by the General Partner or the Partnership. Noncontrolling interests are subsequently adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to noncontrolling holders and the noncontrolling holders' proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity. We report noncontrolling interests as a component of total equity.

When a Common Unit of the Partnership is redeemed (Note 1), the change in ownership is treated as an equity transaction by the General Partner and there is no effect on its earnings or net assets.

Revenue Recognition

On January 1, 2018, we concurrently adopted ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

("ASC 606") and ASC 610-20,

Other Income: Gains and Losses from the De-recognition of Non-financial Assets

("ASC 610-20") using a modified retrospective ("cumulative effect") method of adoption. ASC 606 has superseded nearly all existing GAAP revenue recognition guidance, although its scope excludes lease contracts, which represent our primary source of revenue. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it satisfies performance obligations, by transferring promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for fulfilling those performance obligations.

There was no cumulative adjustment recognized to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 as the result of adopting ASC 606 and ASC 610-20.

Rental and Related Revenue

The timing of revenue recognition under an operating lease is determined based upon ownership of the tenant improvements. If we are the owner of the tenant improvements, revenue recognition commences after the improvements are completed and the tenant takes possession or control of the space. If we determine that the tenant allowances or improvements we are funding are lease incentives, then we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant. Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis.

We record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any material conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us.

General Contractor and Service Fee Revenue

Effective on January 1, 2018, general contractor and service fee revenues, as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, are accounted for within the scope of ASC 606. General contractor and service fee revenues are comprised primarily of construction and development related revenues earned from third parties while acting in capacity of a developer, as a general contractor or a construction manager. There are other ancillary streams of revenue included in general contractor and service fee revenues (see Note 9), such as management fees earned from unconsolidated joint ventures, which are not significant.

Our construction arrangements are typically structured with only one performance obligation, which generally represents an obligation either to construct a new building or to construct fixtures in an existing building, and these single performance obligations are satisfied over time as construction progresses. We recognize revenue as we satisfy such performance obligations using the percentage of completion method, which is an input method allowed under ASC 606. Using this method, profits are recorded based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under the contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. We believe the percentage of completion method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services as changes in job performance and estimated profitability, which result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined, have not historically been significant. We typically receive regular progress payments on the majority of our construction arrangements and such arrangements generally have an original duration of less than one year. As the result of the relatively short duration of our construction arrangements, we have elected to apply the optional disclosure exemptions, included in ASC 606, related to our remaining performance obligations for our in-process construction projects, for which any future variable consideration is not material. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.  To the extent that a fixed-price contract is estimated to result in a loss, the loss is recorded immediately.

Opening and closing balances of construction receivables are presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under billed and over billed receivables on construction contracts totaled

$

16.5

million

and

$

159,000

, respectively, at

December 31, 2019

and

$

29.1

million

and

$

161,000

, respectively, at

December 31, 2018

.  Over billed receivables are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We generally do not have any contract assets associated with our construction arrangements.

Management fees are based on a percentage of rental receipts of properties managed and are recognized as the rental receipts are collected. Maintenance fees are based upon established hourly rates and are recognized as the services are performed.

Property Sales

Only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations (for example, a disposal of a major geographic area or a major line of business) should be presented as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, without consideration of significant continuing involvement. The Medical Office Portfolio Disposition during 2017 has met the criteria under ASC 205-20 for all of the consolidated in-service properties within the portfolio to be classified within discontinued operations (see Note 7).

Effective on January 1, 2018, gains on sales of properties, including partial sales, of non-financial assets (and in-substance non-financial assets) to non-customers are recognized in accordance with ASC 610-20, while the sale of non-financial assets with customers are governed by ASC 606. The only difference in the treatment of sales to customers and non-customers is the presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (revenue and expense is reported when the sale is to a customer and net gain or loss is reported when the sale is to a non-customer). Based on the nature of our business, our property sales generally represent transactions with non-customers. In the typical course of our business, sales of non-financial assets represent only one performance

obligation and are recognized when an enforceable contract is in place, collectability is ensured and control is transferred to the buyer.

Under ASC 610-20 we are required to recognize a full gain or loss in a partial sale of non-financial assets, to the extent control is not retained. Any noncontrolling interest retained by the seller would, accordingly, be measured at fair value. We have primarily disposed of property and land in all cash transactions with no contingencies and no future involvement in the operations, and therefore, the adoption of ASC 610-20 has not significantly impacted the recognition of property and land sales.

Net Income Per Common Share or Common Unit

Basic net income per common share or Common Unit is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders, less dividends or distributions on share-based awards expected to vest (referred to as "participating securities" and primarily composed of unvested restricted stock units), by the weighted average number of common shares or Common Units outstanding for the period.

Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the sum of net income attributable to common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in earnings allocable to Limited Partner Units (to the extent the Limited Partner Units are dilutive), less dividends or distributions on participating securities that are anti-dilutive, by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, to the extent they are dilutive, weighted average number of Limited Partner Units outstanding and any potential dilutive securities for the period. Diluted net income per Common Unit is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common unitholders, less dividends or distributions on participating securities that are anti-dilutive, by the sum of the weighted average number of Common Units outstanding and any potential dilutive securities for the period.

The following table reconciles the components of basic and diluted net income per common share or Common Unit (in thousands):

There have been no participating securities that are anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

Federal Income Taxes

General Partner

The General Partner has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, as amended. To qualify as a REIT, the General Partner must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least


%

of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders. Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to maintain the General Partner's REIT status. As a REIT, the General Partner is entitled to a tax deduction for the dividends it pays to shareholders. Accordingly, the General Partner generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as it currently distributes to shareholders an amount equal to or in excess of its taxable income. The General Partner is, however, generally subject to federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to its shareholders. If the General Partner fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.

REIT qualification reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of state and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a dividends paid deduction and are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.  As a REIT, the General Partner may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes if it engages in certain types of transactions.

Partnership

For the Partnership, the allocated share of income and loss other than the operations of its taxable REIT subsidiary is included in the income tax returns of its partners; accordingly the only federal income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Partnership are in connection with its taxable REIT subsidiary.

Deferred Tax Assets

A valuation allowance is in place for substantially all of the deferred tax assets of the taxable REIT subsidiary for all periods presented.  Based primarily on the projections of taxable income pursuant to our current operating strategy, management believes that it is more likely than not that the taxable REIT subsidiary will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.  Income taxes are not material to our operating results or financial position.  Our taxable REIT subsidiary has no significant net deferred income tax positions or unrecognized tax benefit items.

Fair Value Measurements

We estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methodologies. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to which we have access.

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily consist of derivative financial instruments (see Note 13). We were not party to any derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2019.  In previous periods, we determined the fair value of derivative instruments using standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and termination cost at each balance sheet date. We recognized all derivatives at fair value within the line items Other Assets or Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect nonperformance risk for us and the respective counter-party in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as mutual puts.

DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Although the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.

In addition to the acquired properties discussed in Note 4, assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements consisted of real estate assets, both buildings and undeveloped land, which were determined to be impaired and recorded at fair value as discussed in Note 7.

The table below aggregates the total fair value of these impaired assets as determined during the years ended

Derivative Financial Instruments

We periodically enter into certain interest rate protection agreements to effectively convert or cap floating rate debt to a fixed rate, and to hedge anticipated future financing transactions, both of which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12,

Targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities

("ASU 2017-12"). ASU 2017-12 eliminates the current requirement to separately recognize periodic hedge ineffectiveness and requires the entire effect of the hedging instrument and hedged item to be presented in the same income statement line item. ASU 2017-12 was effective for public entities on January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective approach with early adoption permitted after the issuance. We early adopted ASU 2017-12 effective October 1, 2018 and such adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

If a derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

As part of adoption, we elected the package of practical expedients available for implementation, which included: (i) relief from re-assessing whether an expired or existing contract meets the definition of a lease, (ii) relief from re-assessing the classification of expired or existing leases at the adoption date and (iii) allowing previously capitalized initial direct leasing costs to continue to be amortized. Due in large part to electing these practical expedients, the adoption of ASC 842 did not result in recording a cumulative adjustment to the opening balance of distributions in excess of net income.

Lessor Accounting

Our primary business is the development, acquisition, and operation of industrial real estate properties that are held for investment and leased to tenants. Due to electing the package of practical expedients that allow for relief from re-assessing the classification of existing leases at the adoption date, as well as based on the characteristics of our underlying assets and leases, all of our leases are classified as operating leases. We manage residual risk through investing in properties that we believe will appreciate in value over time. We also perform a credit analysis for tenants prior to leases being executed, and on an ongoing basis, to ensure collectability is probable prior to recognizing lease revenues on an accrual basis.  For lessors, the accounting under ASC 842 remains largely unchanged with the notable exception that ASC 842 requires that lessors expense certain initial direct costs, which were capitalizable under prior leasing standards, as incurred. Under the new standard, only the incremental costs of signing a lease are capitalizable.  As the result of this change, we recognized

$

12.4

million

of expense for internal costs related to successful leases for the year ended December 31, 2019, presented separately in the line item "Non-Incremental Costs Related to Successful Leases" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, which previously would have been capitalized. For the year ended December 31, 2018 we capitalized

$

12.3

million

of internal lease related costs which would have been expensed had ASC 842 been effective.

ASC 842 also requires lessors to exclude certain lessor costs, such as real estate taxes and insurance, that are paid directly by lessees to third parties from rental revenue and the associated rental expense. Lessor costs that are paid by the lessor and reimbursed by the lessee continue to be recorded through rental revenue and the associated rental expense.

ASC 842 provides lessors an additional practical expedient to not separate rental recovery revenue related to lease-related services from the associated rental revenue related to the lease when certain criteria are met. The lease-related services provided to our tenants include property management, common area maintenance ("CAM") and utilities. We assessed the applicable criteria, concluding that the timing and straight-line pattern of transfer to the lessees for rental recovery revenue from our lease-related services and revenue from the underlying leases are the same and that lease classification does not change, and elected to apply this additional practical expedient.

Our leases generally include scheduled rent increases, but do not include variable payments based on indexes. Our rental revenue is primarily based on fixed, non-cancelable leases. Our variable rental revenue primarily consists of amounts recovered from lessees for property tax, insurance and CAM.

All revenues related to lease and lease-related services are included in, and comprise substantially all of, the caption "Rental and Related Revenue" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

The components of Rental and Related Revenue for the years ended

December 31, 2019

The future minimum rents due to us under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows (in thousands):

Lessee Accounting

ASC 842 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification determines whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of classification.

As of

December 31, 2019

, our lease arrangements primarily consisted of office and ground leases. Adoption of the practical expedients resulted in the continued classification of our leases as operating leases. Expense recognized on these leases for the year ended

December 31, 2019

was not material.

For these arrangements, we recognized a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability at the January 1, 2019 adoption date of ASC 842, representing the discounted value of future lease payments required under our lease arrangements. A

$

40.5

million

ROU asset, net of pre-existing lease related accruals, was included in Other Escrow Deposits and Other Assets, and a corresponding lease liability of

$

46.9

million

was included in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2019

.  In determining these amounts we elected an available practical expedient that allows us, as a lessee, to not separate lease and non-lease components.

The following table summarizes the future operating lease payments (in thousands) to be made under our non-cancellable lease arrangements:

The weighted average remaining lease term for our lease arrangements, on a combined basis as of

December 31, 2019

, was

31.4

years. The weighted average discount rate for our lease arrangements as of

December 31, 2019

was

4.47

%

.  As the discount rates implied in our lease arrangements are not readily determinable, we utilized our current credit ratings and credit yields observed from market traded securities with similar credit ratings to form a reasonable basis to establish secured borrowing rates when determining the present value of future lease payments.

Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash

("ASU 2016-18"). ASU 2016-18 requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2018, on a retrospective basis, and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):

Fair Value Measurements

We determine the fair value of the individual components of real estate asset acquisitions primarily through calculating the "as-if vacant" value of a building, using an income approach, which relies significantly upon internally determined assumptions. We have determined that these estimates primarily rely on Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions.

The most significant assumptions used in calculating the "as-if vacant" value for acquisition activity during


and


, respectively, are as follows:

Capitalized acquisition costs were insignificant and the fair value of the

six

properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019 was substantially the same as the cost of acquisition.

Dispositions

Dispositions of buildings (see Note 7 for the number of buildings sold in each year, as well as for their classification between continuing and discontinued operations) and undeveloped land generated net cash proceeds of

$

432.7

million

,

$

and


, respectively.

In September 2019, we completed the sale of


non-strategic industrial properties for

$

217.5

million

in proceeds and recorded a gain on sale of

$

146.3

million

. These properties totaled

4.1

million

square feet and were located in primarily Midwest markets.

Dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2017 included


consolidated properties sold as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition to a subsidiary of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. ("HTA"), as well as certain other buyers, for a total sales price of

$

2.78

billion

and a gain on sale of

$

1.39

billion

. The Medical Office Portfolio Disposition was executed in connection with our strategy to focus solely on the industrial real estate product type.

A portion of the sale price for the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition was financed through either unsecured notes, or first mortgage interests in a portion of the sold properties, that we provided to HTA and other buyers, totaling

$

400.0

million

. We concluded that the value, and the rate of interest, for these financial instruments would approximate fair value as computed using an income approach and that this determination of fair value was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs. We collected the same amount of principal on notes receivable in the amount of

$

145.0

million

for both 2019 and 2018. We held the remaining

$

110.0

million

of notes receivable as of December 31, 2019 which matured and was paid in full in January 2020.

In connection with the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, during the year ended December 31, 2017 we received

The gains recognized in connection with our sales of these ownership interests, which are classified within equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, are not reflected in the summarized financial information for the underlying unconsolidated joint ventures.

(2) Differences between the net investment in our unconsolidated joint ventures and our underlying equity in the net assets of the ventures are primarily a result of previous impairments related to our investment in the unconsolidated joint ventures, basis differences associated with the sales of properties to joint ventures in which we retained an ownership interest and loans we have made to the joint ventures.

Real estate assets, excluding assets held-for-sale, consisted of the following (in thousands):

(1) Includes real estate assets that we intend to redevelop within a relatively short time frame that are under leaseback to the seller(s) and generating income.

Discontinued Operations

All of the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 and included in discontinued operations are medical office properties. Because of the size of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, and the fact that it represented our exit from the medical office product type, we determined that the disposition represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, the consolidated in-service properties in this portfolio met the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations. As the result of its classification within discontinued operations, operating results pertaining to the properties classified within discontinued operations were reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

The following table illustrates the number of sold or held-for-sale properties included in, or excluded from, discontinued operations:

Properties sold in 2017 but excluded from discontinued operations included four properties under development, which were disposed as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, as these properties did not meet the criteria to be included in discontinued operations.

For the properties that were classified in discontinued operations, we allocated interest expense to discontinued operations and have included such interest expense in computing income from discontinued operations. Interest expense allocable to discontinued operations includes interest on any secured debt for properties included in discontinued operations and an allocable share of our consolidated unsecured interest expense for unencumbered properties. The allocation of unsecured interest expense to discontinued operations was based upon the gross book value of the unencumbered real estate assets included in discontinued operations as it related to the total gross book value of our unencumbered real estate assets. There were no additional properties classified as discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and, as such, no interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations during those periods.

The fair value of the land upon which we recognized impairment charges was estimated based on asset-specific offers to purchase, comparable transactions and, in certain cases, estimates made by national and local independent real estate brokers who were familiar with the land parcels subject to evaluation as well as with conditions in the specific markets where the various land parcels are located.  In all cases when estimates from brokers were utilized, members of our senior management who were responsible for the individual markets where the land parcels are located, and members of the Company’s accounting and financial management team, reviewed the broker’s estimates for factual accuracy and reasonableness.  In all cases, we were ultimately responsible for all valuation estimates made in determining the extent of the impairment. Our valuation estimates primarily relied upon Level 3 inputs.

, our secured debt was collateralized by rental properties with a carrying value of

$

99.0

and by a letter of credit in the amount of

$

1.9

million

.

The fair value of our fixed rate secured debt at

December 31, 2019

was

$

34.5

million

. Because our fixed rate secured debt is not actively traded in any marketplace, we utilized a discounted cash flow methodology to determine its fair value. Accordingly, we calculated fair value by applying an estimate of the current market rate to discount the debt's remaining contractual cash flows. Our estimate of a current market rate, which is the most significant input in the discounted cash flow calculation, is intended to replicate debt of similar maturity and loan-to-value relationship. The estimated market rates for all of our current fixed rate secured debt is between

3.10

%

and

3.30

%

, based on the attributes of the specific loans. The current market rates we utilized were internally estimated; therefore, we have concluded that our determination of fair value for our fixed rate secured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.

During 2019, we repaid

three

fixed rate secured loans, totaling

$

41.7

million

, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of

Unsecured Debt

At

December 31, 2019

, all of our unsecured debt bore interest at fixed rates and primarily consisted of unsecured notes that are publicly traded. We utilized broker estimates in estimating the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt. Our unsecured notes are thinly traded and, in certain cases, the broker estimates were not based upon comparable transactions. The broker estimates took into account any recent trades within the same series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, comparisons to recent trades of other series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, trades of fixed rate unsecured debt from companies with profiles similar to ours, as well as overall economic conditions. We reviewed these broker estimates for reasonableness and accuracy, considering whether the estimates were based upon market participant assumptions within the principal and most advantageous market and whether any other observable inputs would be more accurate indicators of fair value than the broker estimates. We concluded that the broker estimates were representative of fair value. We have determined that our estimation of the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs.  The estimated trading values of our fixed rate unsecured debt, depending on the maturity and coupon rates, ranged from

100.00

%

to

129.00

%

of face value.

The indentures (and related supplemental indentures) governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations.

The Partnership's unsecured line of credit has an interest rate on borrowings of

LIBOR

plus

0.875

%

and a maturity date of

January 30, 2022

, with options to extend until January 30, 2023.  Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional

$

800.0

million

, for a total of up to

$

2.00

billion

.  This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.

This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At

December 31, 2019

,

we were in compliance with all financial covenants under this line of credit.

To the extent there are outstanding borrowings, we utilize a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value of outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit.

T

o the extent that credit spreads have changed since the origination of the line of credit, the net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate would represent the difference between the book value and the fair value. This estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate, considering current market conditions and our specific credit profile, at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings. As our credit spreads have not changed appreciably, we believe that the contractual interest rate and the current market rate on any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit are the same. The current market rate is internally estimated and therefore is primarily based upon a Level 3 input.

Segment Reporting

Reportable Segments

During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we completed the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, which resulted in all of our in-service medical office properties being classified within discontinued operations, with the exception of a property that did not meet the criteria for classification as held-for-sale at

December 31, 2019

.   As a result of this transaction, beginning the second quarter of 2017, our medical office properties were no longer presented as a separate reportable segment, with substantially all such operating results being classified within discontinued operations.  The remaining medical office property included in continuing operations no longer meets the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation, and is classified as part of our Non-Reportable Rental Operations. Properties that are not included in our reportable segments, because they do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment, are generally referred to as Non-Reportable Rental Operations.  Our Non-Reportable Rental Operations primarily include our remaining office properties and medical office property at

Our strategic initiatives and our allocation of resources have been historically based upon allocation among product types, which was consistent with our designation of reportable segments, and after having sold nearly all of our office and medical office properties we intend to increase our investment in industrial properties and treat them as a single operating and reportable segment. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our Non-Reportable Rental Operations, are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations."

Our second reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development, general contracting and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively referred to as "Service Operations." The Service Operations segment is identified as one single operating segment because the lowest level of financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision maker are the results for the Service Operations segment in total

.

Further, our reportable segments are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary, a legal entity through which certain of the segment's aforementioned operations are conducted.

Supplemental Performance Measure

PNOI is the non-GAAP supplemental performance measure that we use to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources among, the real estate investments in the reportable and operating segments that comprise our Rental Operations.  PNOI for our Rental Operations segments is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items (collectively referred to as "Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI," as shown in the following table).  Additionally, we do not allocate interest expense, depreciation expense and certain other non-property specific revenues and expenses (collectively referred to as "Non-Segment Items," as shown in the following table) to our individual operating segments.

We evaluate the performance of our Service Operations reportable segment using net income or loss, as allocated to that segment ("Earnings from Service Operations").

(in thousands and excluding discontinued operations):

The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes. PNOI excludes expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, PNOI may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Shareholders' Equity of the General Partner and Partners' Capital of the Partnership

General Partner

The General Partner has an ATM equity program that allows it to issue and sell its common shares through sales agents from time to time.  Actual sales under the ATM equity program depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the General Partner, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the General Partner’s common stock, determinations by the General Partner of the appropriate sources of funding and potential uses of funding available.

In August 2019, the General Partner terminated its previous equity distribution agreement for the ATM equity program and entered into a new equity distribution agreement to sell shares of its common stock,

$

0.01

par value per share, from time to time, up to an aggregate offering price of

$

400.0

million

.

During 2019, the General Partner issued

8.0

million

common shares pursuant to its ATM equity programs, generating gross proceeds of

$

266.3

million

and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of

$

263.3

million

. The proceeds from these offerings were contributed to the Partnership and used to fund development activities.

During 2018, the General Partner issued

990,400

common shares pursuant to its ATM equity program, generating gross proceeds of approximately

$

29.0

million

and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of approximately

$

28.4

million

. The proceeds from these offerings were contributed to the Partnership and used to fund development activities.

During 2017, the General Partner did not issue any common shares pursuant to its ATM equity programs.

Partnership

For each common share or preferred share that the General Partner issues, the Partnership issues a corresponding Common Unit or Preferred Unit, as applicable, to the General Partner in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. Similarly, when the General Partner redeems or repurchases common shares or preferred shares, the Partnership redeems the corresponding Common Units or Preferred Units held by the General Partner at the same price.

Stock Based Compensation

We are authorized to issue up to

10.6

million

shares of the General Partner's common stock under our stock-based employee and non-employee compensation plans.

Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")

Under our


Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by the General Partner's shareholders in

April 2015

, and our


Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Compensation Plans"), RSUs may be granted to non-employee directors, executive officers and selected employees. A RSU is economically equivalent to a share of the General Partner's common stock and RSUs are valued based on the market price of the General Partner's common stock on the date of the award.

RSUs granted to employees from


to


vest ratably in most cases over a

three

-year period, and are payable in shares of our common stock with a new share of such common stock issued upon each RSU's vesting.  RSUs granted to employees prior to


vest ratably over a

five

-year period and are payable in the same manner.  RSUs granted to existing non-employee directors vest


%

over

one

year and have contractual lives of

one

year.

To the extent that a recipient of a RSU grant is not determined to be retirement eligible, as defined by the Compensation Plans, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  Expense is recognized immediately at the date of grant to the extent a recipient is retirement eligible and expense is accelerated to the extent that a participant will become retirement eligible prior to the end of the contractual life of granted RSUs.

The following table summarizes transactions for our RSUs, excluding dividend equivalents, for

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, su

ch as changes in interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

In 2018, we entered into

two

forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts of

$

200.0

million

. In 2019, we entered into

three

additional forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts of

$

150.0

million

. We entered into these interest rate swap contracts to hedge our exposure to the changes in the interest rates on an anticipated debt offering in late 2019. These forward starting swaps were appropriately designated as cash flow

-


-

hedges, with any changes in fair value recorded in AOCL.  We determined the fair values of these interest rate swaps by using standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and termination cost at each balance sheet date. The inputs used to value these interest rate swaps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

In November 2019, we issued

$

400.0

million

of

2.88

%

senior unsecured notes due 2029 (see Note 8) and terminated all of the forward starting interest rate swaps, resulting in a cash payment of

$

35.6

million

to the counter parties, which was recorded in AOCL and is being recognized through interest expense over the term of the notes. The remaining unamortized amount as of December 31, 2019 was

$

35.0

million

.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Partnership has guaranteed the repayment of

$

22.0

million

of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We may be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees.

The Partnership also has guaranteed the repayment of loans associated with

one

of our unconsolidated joint ventures.  At

December 31, 2019

, the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately

$

55.4

million

.

We lease certain land positions with terms extending to

December 31, 2065

, with a total future payment obligation of

$

90.2

million

at December 31,


. No payments on these ground leases, which are classified as operating leases, are material in any individual year.

In addition to ground leases, we are party to other operating leases as part of conducting our business, including leases of office space from third parties, with a total future payment obligation of

$

35.4

million

at December 31,


.  No future payments on these leases are material in any individual year.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

We own certain parcels of land that are subject to special property tax assessments levied by quasi municipal entities. To the extent that such special assessments are fixed and determinable, the discounted value of the full assessment is recorded as a liability.  We have

$

1.0

million

of such special assessment liabilities, which are included within other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2019

.
