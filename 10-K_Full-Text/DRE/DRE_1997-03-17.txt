                                   PART I
                                      
   ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
   
   Duke   Realty  Investments,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is  a   self-
   administered   and  self-managed  real  estate  investment   trust
   ("REIT").  The  Company began operations upon  completion  of  its
   initial  public  offering in February 1986. In October  1993,  the
   Company   completed  an  additional  common  stock  offering   and
   acquired  the  rental real estate and service businesses  of  Duke
   Associates  whose operations began in 1972. The Company's  primary
   business  segment  is  the  ownership and  rental  of  industrial,
   office  and  retail  properties throughout  the  Midwest.   As  of
   December  31, 1996, it owned interests in a diversified  portfolio
   of  266  rental  properties comprising 31.2  million  square  feet
   (including 17 properties and one expansion comprising 3.8  million
   square  feet  under  development).  Substantially  all  of   these
   properties  are  located  in  the  Company's  primary  markets  of
   Indianapolis, Indiana; Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus,  Ohio;
   Detroit,  Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri and Nashville,  Tennessee.
   In  addition  to  its Rental Operations, the Company  through  its
   Service  Operations provides, on a fee basis, leasing, management,
   construction,  development  and other  real  estate  services  for
   approximately  8.7  million square feet  of  properties  owned  by
   third  parties. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and  Analysis
   of  Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations"  and  Item  8
   "Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data"  for   financial
   information  of  these  industry segments.  The  Company's  rental
   operations  are conducted through Duke Realty Limited  Partnership
   (the  "Operating Partnership"). In addition, the Company  conducts
   its  service  operations  through  Duke  Realty  Services  Limited
   Partnership  and Duke Construction Limited Partnership,  in  which
   the  Company's  wholly-owned subsidiary, Duke Services,  Inc.,  is
   the  sole general partner. All references to the "Company" in this
   Form  10-K Report include the Company and those entities owned  or
   controlled   by   the   Company,  unless  the  context   indicates
   otherwise.  The  Company  has the largest commercial  real  estate
   operations  in  Indianapolis and Cincinnati  and  is  one  of  the
   largest real estate companies in the Midwest.
   
   The  Company's headquarters and executive offices are  located  in
   Indianapolis,  Indiana.  In  addition,  the  Company   has   seven
   regional  offices  located in Cincinnati,  Ohio;  Columbus,  Ohio;
   Cleveland,  Ohio; Decatur, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Nashville,
   Tennessee  and St. Louis, Missouri. The Company had 480  employees
   as of December 31, 1996.
                                  - 1 -
   
   
   BUSINESS STRATEGY
   
   The  Company's  business objective is to increase its  Funds  From
   Operations  ("FFO")  by  (i) maintaining and  increasing  property
   occupancy  and  rental rates through the aggressive management  of
   its  portfolio  of  existing properties; (ii)  expanding  existing
   properties;  (iii)  developing and acquiring new  properties;  and
   (iv)  providing  a  full  line  of real  estate  services  to  the
   Company's  tenants  and to third-parties. FFO is  defined  by  the
   National  Association  of  Real Estate Investment  Trusts  as  net
   income  or  loss excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring
   and  sales  of  property plus depreciation and  amortization,  and
   after    adjustments   for   minority   interest,   unconsolidated
   partnerships   and  joint  ventures  (adjustments   for   minority
   interests,  unconsolidated partnerships  and  joint  ventures  are
   calculated  to  reflect FFO on the same basis).  While  management
   believes   that  FFO  is  a  relevant  measure  of  the  Company's
   operating  performance  because it  is  widely  used  by  industry
   analysts  to  measure the operating performance of  equity  REITs,
   such  amount  does  not  represent cash flow  from  operations  as
   defined  by  generally accepted accounting principles, should  not
   be  considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator  of
   the  Company's  operating performance, and is  not  indicative  of
   cash  available to fund all cash flow needs. As a fully integrated
   commercial  real estate firm, the Company believes  that  its  in-
   house  leasing, management, development and construction  services
   and  the  Company's  significant base of  commercially  zoned  and
   unencumbered  land  in  existing business parks  should  give  the
   Company   a   competitive  advantage  in  its  future  development
   activities.
                                      
   The   Company   believes  that  the  analysis   of   real   estate
   opportunities and risks can be done most effectively  at  regional
   or  local  levels.  As a result, the Company intends  to  continue
   its  emphasis  on increasing its market share and effective  rents
   in  its  primary  markets within the Midwest.   The  Company  also
   expects  to  utilize its approximately 1,200 acres of unencumbered
   land  and  its  many business relationships with more  than  2,800
   commercial   tenants   to   expand  its   build-to-suit   business
   (development  projects  substantially  pre-leased  to   a   single
   tenant)   and   to   pursue  other  development  and   acquisition
   opportunities  in  its  primary  markets  and  elsewhere  in   the
   Midwest.   The  Company  believes that this  regional  focus  will
   allow  it to assess market supply and demand for real estate  more
   effectively  as well as to capitalize on its strong  relationships
   with its tenant base.
   
   The  Company's  policy is to seek to develop and  acquire  Class  A
   commercial   properties  located  in  markets  with   high   growth
   potential for Fortune 500 companies and other quality regional  and
   local   firms.   The  Company's  industrial  and  suburban   office
   development  focuses  on business parks and mixed-use  developments
   suitable  for  development of multiple projects on  a  single  site
   where  the Company can create and control the business environment.
   These  business parks and mixed-use developments generally  include
   restaurants  and  other amenities which the Company  believes  will
   create  an atmosphere that is particularly efficient and desirable.
   The  Company's retail development focuses on community,  power  and
   neighborhood  centers  in  its  existing  markets.   As   a   fully
   integrated real estate company, the Company is able to arrange  for
   or  provide to its industrial, office and retail tenants  not  only
   well  located  and well maintained facilities, but also  additional
   services   such   as  build-to-suit  construction,  tenant   finish
   construction,  expansion flexibility and advertising and  marketing
   services.
   
   Consistent  with its business strategy of expanding in  attractive
   Midwestern  markets,  the  Company  carefully  analyzed  the  real
   estate   investment   potential  of   several   major   Midwestern
   metropolitan  areas. Based on this analysis, management  concluded
   that  the  St.  Louis and Cleveland markets offer attractive  real
   estate  investment returns in the industrial and  suburban  office
   markets   based   on   the  following  factors:   (i)   fragmented
   competition;  (ii)  strong  real estate  fundamentals;  and  (iii)
   favorable economic conditions.
                                  - 2 -   
   
   In  1995,  the Company established a regional office in St.  Louis
   and  acquired  463,000 square feet of suburban  office  properties
   and  153  acres  of land for the future development of  industrial
   properties.  In  February  1996, the Company  acquired  a  782,000
   gross  square  foot  suburban office portfolio and  the  operating
   personnel of an independent real estate developer and operator  in
   Cleveland.  The  Company has aggressively pursued the  development
   and  acquisition of additional rental properties in both  the  St.
   Louis and Cleveland markets.
   
   All  of the Company's properties are located in areas that include
   competitive  properties. Such properties are  generally  owned  by
   institutional  investors,  other  REITs  or  local   real   estate
   operators;  however,  no  single  competitor  or  small  group  of
   competitors is dominant in the Company's markets. The  supply  and
   demand  of  similar  available rental properties  may  affect  the
   rental  rates  the  Company will receive on its properties.  Based
   upon  the  current occupancy rates in the Company and  competitive
   properties,  the  Company believes there will not  be  significant
   competitive pressure to lower rental rates in the near future.
   
   FINANCING STRATEGY
   
   The  Company  seeks to maintain a well-balanced, conservative  and
   flexible capital structure by: (i) currently targeting a ratio  of
   long-term debt to total market capitalization in the range of  25%
   to  40%; (ii) extending and sequencing the maturity dates  of  its
   debt;  (iii)  borrowing primarily at fixed rates;  (iv)  generally
   pursuing   current  and  future  long-term  debt  financings   and
   refinancings   on   an  unsecured  basis;  and   (v)   maintaining
   conservative  debt  service  and  fixed  charge  coverage  ratios.
   Management believes that these strategies have enabled and  should
   continue  to  enable  the Company to access the  debt  and  equity
   capital  markets  for their long-term requirements  such  as  debt
   refinancings  and  financing  development  and  acquisitions   of
   additional    rental   properties.   The   Company   has    raised
   approximately  $626  million  through  public  debt   and   equity
   offerings  during the three years ended December 31,  1996.  Based
   on  these offerings, the Company has demonstrated its abilities to
   access  the  public markets as a source of capital to fund  future
   growth.  In  addition,  as discussed under Item  7,  "Management's
   Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial Condition  and  Results  of
   Operations,"  the  Company has a $150 million  unsecured  line  of
   credit  available  for  short-term  fundings  of  development  and
   acquisition  of  additional rental properties. The Company's  debt
   to  total market capitalization ratio (total market capitalization
   is  defined  as  the total market value of all outstanding  Common
   and  Preferred  Shares  and units of limited partnership  interest
   ("Units")   in   the   Operating  Partnership   plus   outstanding
   indebtedness) at March 7, 1997 was 25.3%. The Company's  ratio  of
   earnings  to  debt service and ratio of earnings to fixed  charges
   for  the  year  ended  December 31, 1996  were  2.60x  and  2.18x,
   respectively. In computing the ratio of earnings to debt  service,
   earnings  have  been calculated by adding debt service  to  income
   before gains or losses on property sales and minority interest  in
   earnings  of  the Operating Partnership. Debt service consists  of
   interest  expense and recurring principal amortization  (excluding
   maturities) and excludes amortization of debt issuance  costs.  In
   computing  the  ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings  have
   been  calculated  by  adding fixed charges, excluding  capitalized
   interest,  to income before gains or losses on property sales  and
   minority interest in earnings of the Operating Partnership.  Fixed
   charges   consist   of   interest  costs,  whether   expensed   or
   capitalized,   the   interest   component   of   rental   expense,
   amortization  of debt issuance costs and preferred stock  dividend
   requirements. Management believes these measures to be  consistent
   with its financing strategy.
   
   OTHER
   
   The  Company's  operations are not dependent on a  single  or  few
   customers as no single customer accounts for more than 2%  of  the
   Company's total revenue. The Company's operations are not  subject
   to  any significant seasonal fluctuations. The Company believes it
   is  in  compliance  with environmental regulations  and  does  not
   anticipate material effects of continued compliance.

   ITEM 6.  SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA
   
   The  following  sets  forth  selected consolidated  financial  and
   operating  information on a historical basis for the  Company  for
   each  of  the  years  in the five year period ended  December  31,
   1996.  The  following  information should be read  in  conjunction
   with  Item  7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of  Financial
   Condition  and  Results of Operations" and Item 8, the  "Financial
   Statements and Supplementary Data" included in this Form 10-K  (in
   thousands, except per share amounts):

   
    (1)Information for 1993 and 1992 has been adjusted for the 1  for
      4.2 reverse stock split effected prior to the completion of the
      1993  reorganization.   The  number  of  shares  excludes   the
      outstanding  minority  interest  partnership  units  which  are
      exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for shares of Common Stock.
   
   (2)Funds  From  Operations, is defined by the National Association
      of  Real  Estate  Investment  Trusts  as  net  income  or  loss
      excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  and sales of
      property   plus  depreciation  and  amortization,   and   after
      adjustments  for minority interest, unconsolidated partnerships
      and   joint   ventures  (adjustments  for  minority  interests,
      unconsolidated  partnerships and joint ventures are  calculated
      to reflect Funds From Operations on the same basis). Funds From
      Operations  does  not represent cash flow  from  operations  as
      defined by generally accepted accounting principles, should not 
      be considered as  an alternative  to  net income as an indicator
      of  the  Company's operating  performance, and is not indicative 
      of cash available to  fund  all cash flow needs. In March 1995,
      NAREIT  issued  a clarification  of  its definition of FFO
      effective  for  years beginning  after December 31, 1995. The
      clarification  provides that  amortization of deferred financing
      costs and depreciation of non-rental real estate assets are no
      longer to be added back to  net  income  in arriving at FFO. The
      Company adopted  these changes effective January 1, 1996, and the
      calculations of  FFO for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994,
      1993 and 1992 have been revised accordingly.
   
   ITEM   7.    MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF   FINANCIAL
   CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS
   
   OVERVIEW
   
   The  Company's operating results depend primarily upon income from
   the  rental  operations  of  its  industrial,  office  and  retail
   properties  located  in  its  primary markets.  This  income  from
   rental  operations is substantially influenced by the  supply  and
   demand  for the Company's rental space in its primary markets.  In
   addition,  the  Company's continued growth is dependent  upon  its
   ability  to maintain occupancy rates and increase rental rates  on
   its   in-service   portfolio  and  to  continue  development   and
   acquisition of additional rental properties.
   
   The  Company's  primary markets in the Midwest have  continued  to
   offer   strong  and  stable  local  economies  and  have  provided
   attractive new development opportunities because of their  central
   location, established
                                  - 14 -
   
   manufacturing base, skilled work force and moderate  labor  costs.
   Consequently,  the  Company's occupancy  rate  of  its  in-service
   portfolio has exceeded 92.0% the last two years and was  95.0%  at
   December  31, 1996.  The Company expects to maintain  its  overall
   occupancy  at  comparable  levels and  also  expects  to  increase
   rental  rates  as leases are renewed or new leases  are  executed.
   This  stable  occupancy as well as increasing rental rates  should
   improve  the  Company's results of operations from its  in-service
   properties.  The  Company's  strategy for  continued  growth  also
   includes developing and acquiring additional rental properties  in
   its   primary   markets  and  expanding  into   other   attractive
   Midwestern markets.
   
   A  new statistic that the Company started tracking in 1996 is Same
   Property  Performance  which compares those properties  that  were
   fully  in-service for all of 1995 and 1996. Because of  the  rapid
   growth  of  the  Company,  this  population  of  properties   only
   represented about 42.2% of the in-service portfolio at  year  end.
   As  a  result  of  the  loss  of  a 90,000  square  foot  downtown
   Cincinnati  office tenant in 1996, along with  the  effects  of  a
   property   tax   reassessment  in  another   downtown   Cincinnati
   property,  Same  Property FFO increased  only  1.1%.  Without  the
   decrease  in the downtown Cincinnati portfolio, Same Property  FFO
   increase for this portfolio would have been 2.7%.
   
   The   following   table  sets  forth  information  regarding   the
   Company's  in-service  portfolio  of  rental  properties   as   of
   December 31, 1996 and 1995 (square feet in thousands):

   Management expects occupancy of the in-service property  portfolio
   to  remain  stable  because  (i)  only  10.7%  and  12.3%  of  the
   Company's  occupied square footage is subject to  leases  expiring
   in  1997  and  1998, respectively, and (ii) the Company's  renewal
   percentage  averaged  80%, 65% and 73% in  1996,  1995  and  1994,
   respectively.
                                  - 15 -

   The   following  table  reflects  the  Company's  in-service  lease
   expiration  schedule  as  of December 31,  1996,  by  product  type
   indicating square footage and annualized net effective rents  under
   expiring leases (in thousands, except per square foot amounts):

   This  stable occupancy, along with increasing rental rates in each
   of  the Company's markets, will allow the in-service portfolio  to
   continue  to provide a comparable or increasing level of  earnings
   from  rental  operations.  The Company  also  expects  to  realize
   growth  in  earnings  from  rental  operations  through  (i)   the
   development  and  acquisition of additional rental  properties  in
   its  primary  markets;  (ii) the expansion into  other  attractive
   Midwestern  markets; and (iii) the completion of the  3.8  million
   square  feet of properties under development at December 31,  1996
   over  the  next  five  quarters. The 3.8 million  square  feet  of
   properties  under development should provide future earnings  from
   rental  operations growth for the Company as they  are  placed  in
   service as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

                                  - 16 -     
     
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     
   A   summary   of  the  Company's  operating  results  and   property
   statistics  for  each  of the years in the three-year  period  ended
   December  31,  1996 is as follows (in thousands,  except  number  of
   properties and per share amounts):

   
   COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Rental Operations
   -----------------
   
   The   Company  increased  its  in-service  portfolio   of   rental
   properties  from  201  properties comprising 20.1  million  square
   feet  at  December  31,  1995  to 249 properties  comprising  27.4
   million  square feet at December 31, 1996 through the  acquisition
   of  34  properties  totaling  3.4  million  square  feet  and  the
   placement   in   service  of  16  properties  and  four   building
   expansions  totaling  4.1 million square  feet  developed  by  the
   Company.
   
   The  Company  also  disposed  of two properties  totaling  182,000
   square  feet. These 48 net additional rental properties  primarily
   account  for  the $48.5 million increase in revenues  from  Rental
   Operations  from 1995 to 1996. The increase from 1995 to  1996  in
   rental   expenses,   real  estate  taxes  and   depreciation   and
   amortization  expense is also a result of the  additional  48  in-
   service rental properties.
   
   Interest  expense  increased by approximately $9.9  million.  This
   increase  was primarily because of interest expense on the  $150.0
   million  of unsecured notes which the Company issued in  September
   1995.   These  notes bear interest at an effective rate  of  7.46%
   and  were  outstanding  a  full  year  in  1996  as  compared   to
   approximately three months in 1995. The Company also issued  $90.0
   million  of  unsecured debt under its medium-term note program  in
   1996  which  bears interest at a weighted average rate  of  7.20%.
   The   proceeds  from  these  debt  issuances  were  used  to  fund
   development  and  acquisition  of  additional  rental   properties
   during 1995 and 1996.
   
   As  a  result  of the above mentioned items, earnings from  rental
   operations  increased  $17.0 million from $37.2  million  for  the
   year  ended December 31, 1995 to $54.2 million for the year  ended
   December 31, 1996.
   
   Service Operations
   ------------------

   Service Operations revenues increased from $17.8 million to  $19.9
   million  for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared  to  the
   year  ended  December 31, 1995 primarily as a result of  increases
   in  construction management fee revenue because of an increase  in
   construction  volume. Service Operations expenses  increased  from
   $11.2  million  to $13.5 million for the year ended  December  31,
   1996 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1995 primarily  as
   a  result of an increase in operating expenses resulting from  the
   overall  growth of the Company and the additional regional offices
   opened in 1995 and 1996.
                                  - 17 -   
   
   
   As  a  result of the above-mentioned items, earnings from  Service
   Operations  decreased from $6.6 million to $6.4  million  for  the
   years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
   
   General and Administrative Expense
   ----------------------------------
   
   General  and  administrative expense increased from  $3.5  million
   for  the year ended December 31, 1995 to $4.7 million for the year
   ended  December 31, 1996 primarily as a result of increased  state
   and  local  taxes due to the growth in revenues and net income  of
   the  Company.  Property advertising expense  as  well  as  certain
   public  company  expenses  also  increased  as  a  result  of  the
   expanding size of the Company.
   
   Other Income (Expense)
   ---------------------
   
   Interest  income decreased from $1.9 million for  the  year  ended
   December 31, 1995 to $1.2 million for the year ended December  31,
   1996  as  a  result of the temporary short-term  investment  of  a
   greater  amount of excess proceeds from the 1995 debt  and  equity
   offerings compared to excess proceeds interest from the 1996  debt
   and equity offerings.
   
   During  the  year  ended December 31, 1996,  the  Company  sold  a
   251,000 square foot corporate headquarters facility to John  Alden
   Life  Insurance Company in Miami, Florida pursuant to  a  purchase
   option  contained in John Alden's original agreement to lease  the
   building.  The  project was sold for approximately  $32.9  million
   and  the  Company recognized a gain of approximately $1.6  million
   on  the  sale.  The  Company  also realized  gains  totaling  $2.9
   million  in  1996  related to the sale  of  a  retail  center  and
   several parcels of land.
   
   Net Income Available for Common Shares
   --------------------------------------
   
   Net  income  available  for  common  shares  for  the  year  ended
   December  31,  1996  was  $50.9 million  compared  to  net  income
   available  for common shares of $35.0 million for the  year  ended
   December  31,  1995.   This increase results  primarily  from  the
   changes  in the operating results of rental and service operations
   explained above.
   
   COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Rental Operations
   -----------------
   
   The   Company  increased  its  in-service  portfolio   of   rental
   properties  from  127  properties comprising 12.9  million  square
   feet  at  December  31,  1994  to 201 properties  comprising  20.1
   million  square feet at December 31, 1995 through the  acquisition
   of  60  properties  totaling  4.6  million  square  feet  and  the
   placement  in service of 17 properties and two building expansions
   totaling  3.2  million square feet developed by the Company.   The
   Company also disposed of three properties totaling 570,000  square
   feet.  These 74 net additional rental properties primarily account
   for  the $24.3 million increase in revenues from Rental Operations
   from 1994 to 1995.
   
   The  increase  from 1994 to 1995 in rental expenses,  real  estate
   taxes  and depreciation and amortization expense is also a  result
   of the additional 74 in-service rental properties.
                                      
   Interest  expense  increased  by approximately  $2.5  million.  This
   increase  was  primarily because of interest expense on  the  $150.0
   million  of  unsecured notes which the Company issued  in  September
   1995.  These notes bear interest at an effective rate of 7.46%.  The
   proceeds  from  these notes were used to (i) retire the  outstanding
   balance  of  $35.0  million  on  the  Company's  unsecured  line  of
   credit; (ii) retire $39.5 million of  mortgage debt
                                  - 18 -
   
   
   which  had  a  weighted average interest rate  of  6.08%  and  was
   scheduled  to  reset  at  a market interest  rate  in  the  fourth
   quarter  of  1995; and (iii) fund development and  acquisition  of
   additional rental properties during the fourth quarter of 1995.
   
   As  a  result  of the above mentioned items, earnings from  rental
   operations  increased  $10.3 million from $26.9  million  for  the
   year  ended December 31, 1994 to $37.2 million for the year  ended
   December 31, 1995.
     
   Service Operations
   ------------------
   
   Earnings   from  Service  Operations  decreased  by  approximately
   $500,000  in  1995  as  compared to 1994.  This  decrease  results
   primarily  from a decrease in construction fees even though  total
   construction  volume remained consistent. This  decrease  in  fees
   resulted  from certain contracts with above-market  fees  in  1994
   which  were not obtained in 1995. Property management, maintenance
   and  leasing fees remained consistent from 1994 to 1995.   Payroll
   expense  decreased from 1994 to 1995 as a result of the allocation
   of  a  greater  portion  of these costs to  the  Company's  Rental
   Operations  segment.  Other  operating  expenses  did  not  change
   materially.
   
   Other Income (Expense)

   Interest  income increased from $1.1 million for  the  year  ended
   December 31, 1994 to $1.9 million for the year ended December  31,
   1995  as a result of the temporary short-term investment of excess
   proceeds from the 1995 debt and equity offerings.
   
   As  part  of its October 1993 acquisition of Duke Associates,  the
   Company  acquired an option to purchase an interest in  an  entity
   which   provided   telecommunication  services   to   tenants   in
   properties owned and managed by the Company. At the time the option
   was acquired, the  option was not considered to have value because of
   recurring  net operating losses by such entity. Subsequent to the
   acquisition  of the option, the entity made changes in its operations,
   principally  entering  into  new contracts  for  the  purchase  of
   telecommunication services and the provision of billing  services,
   which  significantly improved its operating results. As  a  result
   of  these  improvements in operating results, the  entity  entered
   into  an agreement to sell its telecommunications business  to  an
   unaffiliated third party at an amount significantly in  excess  of
   the  Company's option price. The net proceeds from the  sale  were
   then  loaned  to a subsidiary of the Company with  a  mortgage  on
   certain  property. The Company subsequently exercised  its  option
   to  acquire the interest in this entity and recognized a  gain  of
   approximately  $2.0  million based on the difference  between  its
   option  price and the net proceeds received from the sale  to  the
   unaffiliated  third-party. Such gain is included in earnings  from
   property sales in 1994.
                                      
   Net Income Available for Common Shares
   --------------------------------------
   
   Net  income  available  for  common  shares  for  the  year  ended
   December  31,  1995  was  $35.0 million  compared  to  net  income
   available  for common shares of $26.2 million for the  year  ended
   December  31,  1994.   This increase results  primarily  from  the
   changes  in  the operating result of rental and service operations
   explained above.
   
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
   
   Net  cash  provided by operating activities totaling $95.1  million,
   $78.6  million  and $51.9 million for the years ended  December  31,
   1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, represents the primary source  of
   liquidity  to  fund  distributions  to  shareholders  and   minority
   interests   and  to  fund  recurring  costs  associated   with   the
   renovation
                                   - 19 - 
   
   and  re-letting  of the Company's properties. The  primary  reason
   for  the  increases  in net cash provided by operating  activities
   is,   as  discussed  above  under  "Results  of  Operations,"  the
   increase  in net income each year resulting from the expansion  of
   the  in-service portfolio through development and acquisitions  of
   additional rental properties.
   
   Net  cash  used  by investing activities totaling $276.7  million,
   $289.6  million  and $116.2 million for the years  ended  December
   31,  1996,  1995 and 1994, respectively, represents the investment
   of  funds  by  the  Company  to expand  its  portfolio  of  rental
   properties  through the development and acquisition of  additional
   rental  properties. In 1996, $328.4 million was  invested  in  the
   development  and acquisition of additional rental  properties  and
   land  held for development and $9.9 million was used for recurring
   building  and tenant improvements and leasing costs.  Included  in
   the  $328.4  million  of  development and  acquisition  of  rental
   properties  and  land  held for development  for  the  year  ended
   December  31, 1996 is $44.5 million related to the acquisition  of
   eight  suburban  office buildings totaling  782,000  gross  square
   feet  in  Cleveland,  Ohio.  The purchase  price  of  these  eight
   buildings  was  approximately $76.0  million  which  included  the
   assumption  of $23.1 million of mortgage debt and the issuance  of
   $8.4  million  of units of partnership interest in  the  Company's
   operating  partnership.  Also  in  1996,  the  Company  sold   two
   properties and several parcels of land and received $50.8  million
   of  net sales proceeds. These proceeds were used to fund a portion
   of  the 1996 development and acquisition activity. In 1995, $250.3
   million  was  invested  in  the  development  and  acquisition  of
   additional  rental  properties and land held for  development  and
   $8.6   million  was  used  for  recurring  building   and   tenant
   improvements  and  leasing  costs. In  1994,  $106.9  million  was
   invested  in the development and acquisition of additional  rental
   properties  and  land held for development and  $5.9  million  was
   used  for  recurring building and tenant improvements and  leasing
   costs.
   
   Net   cash  provided  by  financing  activities  totaling   $181.2
   million,  $176.2  million and $94.7 million for  the  years  ended
   December  31,  1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, is comprised  of
   debt  and  equity issuances, net of distributions to  shareholders
   and    minority   interests   and   repayments   of    outstanding
   indebtedness.  In March 1996, the Company received $125.3  million
   of  net  proceeds from a common stock offering which was  used  to
   pay  down  amounts outstanding on the unsecured  line  of  credit.
   During  1996,  the  Company  also received  $5.5  million  of  net
   proceeds from the issuance of common stock under its Direct  Stock
   Purchase  and Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The Company  used  these
   net   proceeds   to  fund  the  development  and  acquisition   of
   additional   rental  properties.  In  August  1996,  the   Company
   received  $72.3  million of net proceeds from  a  preferred  stock
   offering.  In  July  1996,  the Company issued  $40.0  million  of
   unsecured  debt  under its medium-term note program.  These  notes
   mature in July 2000 and bear interest at 7.28%. In November  1996,
   the  Company  issued  $50.0 million of unsecured  debt  under  its
   medium-term note program. These notes mature in November 2004  and
   bear  interest  at 7.14%. The Company used the net  proceeds  from
   the  preferred offering and the two medium-term note offerings  to
   pay  off  approximately  $82.5 million of  existing  secured  debt
   which  was  scheduled to mature in the fourth quarter of  1996  or
   early  1997  and  the  remainder  to  fund  the  development   and
   acquisition of additional rental properties. In 1995, the  Company
   received  $96.3  million  of  net proceeds  from  a  common  stock
   offering   and   used  the  proceeds  to  fund   development   and
   acquisition of additional rental properties. In 1995, the  Company
   also  received $150.0 million from an unsecured debt offering  and
   used the proceeds to retire outstanding mortgage indebtedness  and
   to   fund   acquisition  and  development  of  additional   rental
   properties.  In  1994, the Company received $92.1 million  of  net
   proceeds  from  a common stock offering and $60.0 million  from  a
   seven-year  mortgage  loan.  Of  the  $152.1  million   of   these
   proceeds,  the  Company used $16.1 million to  retire  outstanding
   mortgage  indebtedness,  and  the  remainder  primarily  to   fund
   development and acquisition of additional rental properties.
                                    - 20 -   
 
   
   The  recurring  capital needs of the Company are funded  primarily
   through   the   undistributed  net  cash  provided  by   operating
   activities.   A  analysis  of  the  Company's  recurring   capital
   expenditures is as follows (in thousands):

   
   The  Company  has  a  $150.0  million  unsecured  line  of  credit
   available  to  fund the development and acquisition of  additional
   rental  properties and to provide working capital as needed.  This
   line of credit matures in April 1998 and bears interest at the 30-
   day   London   Interbank  Offered  Rate  ("LIBOR")   plus   1.25%.
   Borrowings  of  $24.0  million under this line  of  credit  as  of
   December  31, 1996  bear interest at an effective rate of 6.9375%.
   The  Company  also  has  a demand $10.0 million  secured  line  of
   credit  which  is  available  to  provide  working  capital.  This
   facility  bears interest payable monthly at the 30-day LIBOR  rate
   plus  .75%.  Borrowings of $10.0 million are outstanding  on  this
   line  of  credit  at  December 31, 1996 and bear  interest  at  an
   effective  rate  of 6.23%. The current 30-day  LIBOR  rate  as  of
   March 3, 1997 is 5.4375%.
   
   The  Company  currently  has  on file two  Form  S-3  Registration
   Statements  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the
   "Shelf  Registrations") which have remaining  availability  as  of
   December  31,  1996  of $470.0 million to issue additional  common
   stock,  preferred stock or unsecured debt securities. The  Company
   intends   to   issue  additional  securities  under   such   Shelf
   Registrations   to  fund  the  development  and   acquisition   of
   additional rental properties.
   
   The  total debt outstanding at December 31, 1996 consists of notes
   totaling $525.8 million with a weighted average interest  rate  of
   7.55%  maturing  at various dates through 2017.  The  Company  has
   $264.0  million  of unsecured debt and $261.8 million  of  secured
   debt   outstanding  at  December  31,  1996.  Scheduled  principal
   amortization  of  such  debt totaled $2.1  million  for  the  year
   ended  December  31,  1996.  A summary  of  the  scheduled  future
   amortization  and maturities of the Company's indebtedness  is  as
   follows (in thousands):

      
   The   $10.0   million  of  maturities  in  1997   represents   the
   outstanding  balance  as of December 31,  1996  on  the  Company's
   demand secured line of credit.
   
   The  Company intends to pay regular quarterly dividends  from  net
   cash  provided  by operating activities. A quarterly  dividend  of
   $.51  per  common  share was declared on January  30,  1997  which
   represents an annualized dividend of $2.04 per share.
                                  - 21 -
   
   
   FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS
   
   Management believes that Funds From Operations ("FFO"),  which  is
   defined  by  the  National Association of Real  Estate  Investment
   Trusts  as net income or loss excluding gains or losses from  debt
   restructuring   and  sales  of  property  plus  depreciation   and
   amortization,   and  after  adjustments  for  minority   interest,
   unconsolidated  partnerships and joint ventures  (adjustments  for
   minority  interest, unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures
   are  calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis), is the industry
   standard  for  reporting the operations of real estate  investment
   trusts.
   
   The  following reflects the calculation of the Company's  FFO  for
   the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

                                      
   The  increase  in FFO for the three-year period results  primarily
   from  the  increased  in-service  rental  property  portfolio   as
   discussed above under "Results of Operations."
                                      
   In  March 1995, NAREIT issued a clarification of its definition of
   FFO  effective  for years beginning after December 31,  1995.  The
   clarification  provides that amortization  of  deferred  financing
   costs  and  depreciation of non-rental real estate assets  are  no
   longer  to  be added back to net income in arriving  at  FFO.  The
   Company  adopted these changes effective January 1, 1996, and  the
   calculations  of  FFO for the years ended December  31,  1995  and
   1994 have been revised accordingly.
   
   While  management  believes that FFO  is  the  most  relevant  and
   widely  used measure of the Company's operating performance,  such
   amount does not represent cash flow from operations as defined  by
   generally   accepted   accounting  principles,   should   not   be
   considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of  the
   Company's  operating performance, and is not  indicative  of  cash
   available to fund all cash flow needs.

      INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
      
      To the Shareholders and Directors of
      Duke Realty Investments, Inc.:
      
      We  have audited the consolidated financial statements of  Duke
      Realty  Investments, Inc. and Subsidiaries  as  listed  in  the
      accompanying  index.  In  connection with  our  audits  of  the
      consolidated  financial statements, we also  have  audited  the
      financial  statement  schedule as listed  in  the  accompanying
      index.   These  consolidated  financial  statements   and   the
      financial  statement  schedule are the  responsibility  of  the
      Company's  management.  Our responsibility  is  to  express  an
      opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the
      financial statement schedule based on our audits.
      
      We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted
      auditing  standards. Those standards require that we  plan  and
      perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
      the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
      audit  includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
      the  amounts  and disclosures in the financial  statements.  An
      audit  also  includes assessing the accounting principles  used
      and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  as  well  as
      evaluating  the  overall financial statement  presentation.  We
      believe  that  our audits provide a reasonable  basis  for  our
      opinion.
      
      In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
      to   above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the
      financial  position  of  Duke  Realty  Investments,  Inc.   and
      Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the  results
      of  their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
      in the three-year period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity
      with  generally accepted accounting principles.  Also,  in  our
      opinion,   the  related  financial  statement  schedule,   when
      considered  in  relation  to the basic  consolidated  financial
      statements  taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all  material
      respects, the information set forth therein.

     (1)  THE COMPANY
          -----------
     
       The  Company was formed in 1985 and qualifies as a real estate
       investment  trust  ("REIT")  under  the  provisions   of   the
       Internal   Revenue  Code.   The  Company  is  an   open-ended,
       perpetual-life  REIT which owns and operates  a  portfolio  of
       industrial, office and retail properties in the Midwest.   The
       Company's   primary   markets   are   Indianapolis,   Indiana;
       Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio; St. Louis,  Missouri
       and Nashville, Tennessee.
     
       The  Company's  rental operations are conducted  through  Duke
       Realty  Limited Partnership ("DRLP"). The Company  owns  88.9%
       of  DRLP at December 31, 1996. The remaining interests in DRLP
       ("Limited Partner Units") are exchangeable for shares  of  the
       Company's  common stock on a one-for-one basis.  In  addition,
       the  Company conducts operations through Duke Realty  Services
       Limited    Partnership    and   Duke   Construction    Limited
       Partnership,  in which the Company's wholly-owned  subsidiary,
       Duke Services, Inc., is the sole general partner.
       
  (2)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
       ------------------------------------------
     
       PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
       ---------------------------
        
       The  consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts  of
       the Company and its  majority-owned  or  controlled subsidiaries. 
       The  equity  interests  in  these  majority-owned  or  controlled
       subsidiaries  not  owned by the Company are reflected as minority 
       interests  in  the   consolidated   financial   statements.   All 
       significant  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have been 
       eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
     
       RECLASSIFICATIONS
       -----------------
       
       Certain 1995 and 1994 balances have been reclassified to conform 
       with the 1996 presentation.
       
       SEGMENT OPERATIONS
       ------------------
        
       The  Company  is   engaged  in  two  business  segments,   the
       ownership  and  rental  of  real estate  investments  ("Rental
       Operations")  and  the  providing  of  various   real   estate
       services  such  as  property management, maintenance,  leasing
       and  construction  management to third-party  property  owners
       ("Service  Operations").  There are no  material  intersegment
       sales  or  transfers  between Rental  Operations  and  Service
       Operations. The identifiable assets of the Service  Operations
       consisting   of   cash,   accounts  receivable,   construction
       receivables and other assets as of December 31, 1996 and  1995
       were  $20.7  million and $15.8 million, respectively.  Capital
       expenditures related to Service Operations were $2.0  million,
       $1.5  million  and $761,000 for the years ended  December  31,
       1996,  1995,  and  1994, respectively. All  remaining  assets,
       capital    expenditures,   depreciation,   amortization    and
       investments  in  and  advances  to  unconsolidated   companies
       relate  to  Rental Operations. The operations of each  segment
       are reflected separately on the Statement of Operations.

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                                      
       
       REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS
       -----------------------
       
       Real  estate investments are stated at the lower of  cost less
       accumulated  depreciation  or  fair  value  if  impairment  is
       identified.  Buildings and land improvements  are  depreciated
       on   the  straight-line  method  over  40  years,  and  tenant
       improvement costs are depreciated on the straight-line  method
       over the term of the related lease.
       
       All  direct  and indirect costs, including interest  and  real
       estate   taxes   clearly  associated  with  the   acquisition,
       development,   construction  or  expansion  of   real   estate
       investments  are  capitalized as a cost of  the  property  and
       depreciated  over  the estimated useful life  of  the  related
       asset.
       
       The   Company  evaluates  its  real  estate  investments  upon
       occurrence of significant changes in the operations,  but  not
       less   than   annually,  to  assess  whether  any   impairment
       indications are present, including recurring operating  losses
       and  significant adverse changes in legal factors or  business
       climate  that  affect the recovery of the recorded  value.  If
       any  real estate investment is considered impaired, a loss  is
       provided to reduce the carrying value of the property  to  its
       estimated fair value.
       
       DEFERRED COSTS
       --------------
       
       Costs  incurred  in  connection with obtaining  financing  are
       amortized  on the straight-line method over the  term  of  the
       related  loan.  All direct and indirect costs associated  with
       the rental of real estate project owned  by  the  Company  are 
       amortized over  the  term  of  the related  lease. Unamortized 
       costs  are charged to expense  upon the  early  termination of 
       the lease or upon early payment  of the financing.
       
       Prepaid  interest is amortized to interest expense  using  the
       effective  interest  method over  the  terms  of  the  related
       loans.
                                      
       REVENUES
       --------
       
       Rental Operations
       -----------------
       Rental  income  from  leases with scheduled  rental  increases
       during  their  terms  is  recognized for  financial  reporting
       purposes on a straight-line basis.
       
       Service Operations
       ------------------
       Management  fees are based on a percentage of rental  receipts
       of  properties  managed  and  are  recognized  as  the  rental
       receipts  are  collected.  Maintenance  fees  are  based  upon
       established  hourly rates and are recognized as  the  services
       are  performed.  Leasing fees are based on a percentage of the
       total rental due under  completed  leases  and are   generally  
       recognized  upon lease execution. Construction management  and 
       development  fees are   generally  based  on a  percentage  of  
       costs  and  are recognized as  the project costs are incurred.  
       Other  income consists  primarily  of  payroll  reimbursements  
       for  on-site property management services.

       Net Income Per Common Share
       ---------------------------
       
       Net  income per common share is calculated using the  weighted
       average  number of common shares outstanding during the  year.
       Common  stock  equivalents (consisting of  stock  options  and
       Limited  Partner Units) dilute net income per  share  by  less
       than  3%  and are not considered in computing weighted average
       shares outstanding.
     
       Federal Income Taxes
       --------------------
       
       The Company qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as  a
       REIT  under the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, the  Company
       is  allowed  to reduce taxable income by all or a  portion  of
       its  distributions  to   shareholders.  As  distributions have 
       exceeded taxable income, no provision for federal income taxes 
       has been  made  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial 
       statements.
       
       Earnings  and  profits,  which  determine  the  taxability  of
       dividends  to  shareholders, differ from net  income  reported
       for   financial  reporting  purposes  primarily   because   of
       different  depreciable lives and bases  of  rental  properties
       and  differences in the timing of recognition of earnings upon
       disposition of properties.
     
       A  summary  of  the taxable nature of the Company's  dividends
       for the three years ended December 31 is as follows:

       
       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
       -----------------------------------
       
       The  fair  values  of  the  Company's  financial  instruments,
       including  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable,   accrued
       expenses,  mortgage debt, unsecured notes  payable,  lines  of
       credit  and  other financial instruments, generally determined
       using  the present value of estimated future cash flows  using
       a   discount  rate  commensurate  with  the  risks   involved,
       approximate their carrying or contract values.
       
       USE OF ESTIMATES
       ----------------
       
       The  preparation of the consolidated financial  statements  in
       conformity   with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles
       requires  management  to make estimates and  assumptions  that
       affect  the  amounts  reported in the  consolidated  financial
       statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results   could
       differ from those estimates.

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
   (3)  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
        --------------------------
       
       The  Company  provides management, leasing,  construction  and
       other   tenant  related  services  to  partnerships  in  which
       certain   executive   officers   have   continuing   ownership
       interests.  The Company was paid fees totaling  $3.2  million,
       $2.8  million and $3.0 million for such services in 1996, 1995
       and  1994,  respectively.  Management believes the  terms  for
       such  services  are  equivalent  to  those  available  in  the
       market.  The  Company has an option to purchase the  executive
       officers'  interest in each of these properties which  expires
       October   2003.  The  option  price  of  each   property   was
       established at the date the option was granted.
       
   (4) INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED COMPANIES
       ---------------------------------------
       
       The  Company has equity interests in unconsolidated partnerships
       and  joint ventures which own and operate rental properties  and
       hold  land for development in the Midwest. The equity method  of
       accounting  is used for these investments in which  the  Company
       has   the   ability  to  exercise  significant  influence   over
       operating  and  financial policies. Any difference  between  the
       carrying  amount of these investments and the underlying  equity
       in   net   assets  is  amortized  to  equity  in   earnings   of
       unconsolidated  companies  over 40 years.  The  cost  method  of
       accounting  is  used for non-majority owned joint ventures  over
       which  the  Company  does  not  have  the  ability  to  exercise
       significant  influence. The difference between the  cost  method
       and  the  equity method for such ventures does not significantly
       affect  the financial position or results of operations  of  the
       Company.   In   1995,  the  Company  acquired  its  unaffiliated
       partner's  50%  interest  in a joint  venture  which  owned  two
       suburban  office  rental  properties (one  of  which  was  under
       construction  as of December 31, 1995) and 40.3  acres  of  land
       held  for development. The Company accounted for the acquisition
       of  the 50% interest using the purchase method with its recorded
       investment in the properties equal to the sum of the balance  of
       its  investment in and advances to the joint venture at the date
       of  acquisition, the net liabilities assumed and  cash  paid  to
       the  joint venture partner amounting to $24.4 million. In  1994,
       the Company acquired its unaffiliated partner's 55% interest  in
       a  partnership  which owned a suburban office  rental  property.
       The  Company  accounted for the acquisition of the 55%  interest
       using  the purchase method with its recorded investment  in  the
       property  equal to the sum of its investment in the  partnership
       at   the   date  of  acquisition,  the  cash  payment   to   the
       unaffiliated  partner,  cash  repayment  of  a  portion  of  the
       partnership's   mortgage  loan  and  net  liabilities   assumed,
       including  the  remaining balance on the partnership's  mortgage
       loan  of  $4.5  million. The fair value of the property  exceeds
       the  Company's recorded investment. Also in 1994, a  partnership
       in  which the Company owned a 50% interest was dissolved through
       the  distribution of all assets and liabilities to the partners.
       At  the  date of dissolution, the Company had loans and advances
       to  the  partnership totaling $4.2 million. Under terms  of  the
       dissolution  agreement, the Company received 71  acres  of  land
       held  for  development and the partnership was not  required  to
       repay  the Company's loans and advances. The Company's  recorded
       investment in the property received is equal to the sum  of  its
       investment in and loans and advances to the partnership  at  the
       date of dissolution. The fair value of the property exceeds  the
       Company's recorded investment.
       
       On  December 28, 1995, the Company formed a joint venture (Dugan
       Realty  L.L.C.) with an institutional real estate  investor  and
       purchased  25  industrial buildings totaling  approximately  2.3
       million square feet.

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
       
       Upon   formation  of  the  venture,  the  Company  contributed
       approximately  1.4  million square feet of recently  developed
       and  acquired  industrial properties, 113  acres  of  recently
       acquired  land held for future development at an agreed  value
       of  $50.8 million, and approximately $16.7 million of cash for
       a  50.1% interest in the joint venture. The Company's recorded
       investment at December 31, 1995 in the joint venture of  $59.4
       million  is  the sum of the carrying value of the  properties,
       land,  and  cash  contributed.  The  Company's  joint  venture
       partner  contributed cash of $67.5 million which was equal  to
       the  agreed  value  of the Company's contribution.  The  total
       cash  contributed by the Company and the joint venture partner
       was  used to purchase the 25 industrial buildings noted above.
       The   recently   acquired  industrial   properties   and   the
       undeveloped land which were contributed were acquired as  part
       of  the  acquisition of Park Fletcher, Inc., an  Indianapolis,
       Indiana  based real estate development and management company.
       The  acquisition was accounted for under the purchase  method.
       The  recorded  carrying value of the acquired  properties  and
       land  was equal to the net liabilities assumed plus cash  paid
       plus  mortgage indebtedness assumed of $17.4 million. The fair
       value   of   the  property  exceeds  the  Company's   recorded
       investment.  The operating results of the acquired  properties
       and  land  have  been  included in the consolidated  operating
       results  subsequent  to the date of acquisition.  The  Company
       completed  the  development  of 1.1  million  square  feet  of
       property  in  1996  and contributed these  properties  to  the
       joint  venture  at  an  agreed value  of  $24.9  million.  The
       Company  recorded its investment in the joint venture  related
       to  this  additional  contribution at its  carrying  value  of
       $20.5  million. The joint venture partner contributed cash  to
       the  venture  equal  to  49.9% of  the  agreed  value  of  the
       properties  contributed,  $12.4 million,  and  this  cash  was
       distributed   to   the  Company  and  reduced   its   recorded
       investment  in  the  venture. The  Company  accounts  for  its
       investment in this joint venture on the equity method  because
       the  joint  venture  partner's approval is  required  for  all
       major  decisions  and  the  joint venture  partner  has  equal
       control  regarding  the primary day-to-day operations  of  the
       venture.
                                      
       Combined  summarized financial information  of  the  companies
       which  are  accounted for by the equity method as of  December
       31,  1996  and  December  31, 1995 and  for  the  years  ended
       December  31,  1996,  1995,  and  1994  are  as  follows   (in
       thousands):

       Investments  in unconsolidated companies include $6.1  million
       and  $6.0 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively,
       related  to  joint ventures accounted for on the cost  method.
       Included  in  equity  in earnings of unconsolidated  companies
       are  distributions from a joint venture accounted for  on  the

(5)   INDEBTEDNESS
      ------------

      Indebtedness  at  December 31 consists of  the  following  (in
      thousands):

     
     As  of December 31, 1996, the $261.8 million of secured debt  is
     collateralized by rental properties with a net carrying value of
     $523.2 million.
                                  - 37 -
         
     
     
                                      
               DUKE REALTY INVESTMENTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                                      
                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
     In  April 1995, the Company obtained an unsecured line of credit
     in  the aggregate amount of $100 million.  The unsecured line of
     credit  matures  in April 1998. Borrowings under  this  line  of
     credit  required  interest at 30-day  LIBOR  plus  2.00%  as  of
     December  31,  1995  (effective rate of  7.69%).  In  1996,  the
     Company increased its amount available under the unsecured  line
     of  credit  to  $150 million and reduced the borrowing  rate  to
     LIBOR  plus  1.25% as of December 31, 1996  (effective  rate  of
     6.75%).
     
     The   Company   has  an  interest  rate  swap   agreement   (the
     "Agreement")  on  $33.0  million of  the  Company's  outstanding
     mortgage debt to effectively fix the interest rate on a  portion
     of its floating rate debt. Under the Agreement, the Company pays
     or receives the difference between a fixed rate of 5.1875% and a
     floating  rate of 30-day LIBOR plus .75% based on  the  notional
     principal  amount of $33.0 million. The amount paid or  received
     under the Agreement is included in interest expense on a monthly
     basis.  The  Agreement matures along with the  related  mortgage
     loan  in  December 1999. The Agreement will stay in place  until
     maturity  unless  the 30-day LIBOR rate on the date  of  monthly
     repricing  exceeds 6.25% which will cause a termination  of  the
     Agreement. The 30-day LIBOR rate at December 31, 1996 was 5.50%.
     The  estimated fair value of the Agreement at December 31,  1996
     was  $312,000.  The fair value was estimated by discounting  the
     expected  cash  flows to be received under the  Agreement  using
     rates  currently  available for interest rate swaps  of  similar
     terms and maturities.
     
     At  December 31, 1996, scheduled amortization and maturities  of
     all indebtedness for the next five years and thereafter  are  as
     follows  (in thousands):

      
     Cash  paid  for  interest  in 1996, 1995,  and  1994  was  $35.5
     million, $22.1 million, and $20.3 million, respectively.   Total
     interest  capitalized in 1996, 1995 and 1994 was  $5.5  million,
     $4.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
     
  (6)  LEASING ACTIVITY
       ----------------
     
     Future  minimum  rents  due to the Company under  non-cancelable
     operating  leases at December 31, 1996 are scheduled as  follows
     (in thousands):

                                  - 38 -     
     
                                      
               DUKE REALTY INVESTMENTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                                      
                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
     In   addition   to   minimum  rents,  certain   leases   require
     reimbursements of specified operating expenses which amounted to
     $19.7  million, $12.7 million, and $10.0 million for  the  years
     ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     
 (7)  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
      ----------------------
     
     The  Company maintains a profit sharing and salary deferral plan
     for  the benefit of its full-time employees. The Company matches
     the employees' contributions up to two percent of the employees'
     salary  and  may  also make annual discretionary  contributions.
     Total  expense recognized by the Company was $328,000,  $245,000
     and   $370,000  for  the  years  ended  1996,  1995  and   1994,
     respectively.
     
     The  Company  makes contributions to a contributory  health  and
     welfare plan as necessary to fund claims not covered by employee
     contributions.  Total expense recognized by the Company  related
     to  this  plan was $1,193,000, $882,000 and $766,000  for  1996,
     1995  and  1994, respectively. Included in total expense  is  an
     estimate based on historical experience of the effect of  claims
     incurred but not reported as of year-end.
     
  (8)   SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
        --------------------
   
     The  Company periodically accesses the public equity markets  to
     fund  the  development  and  acquisition  of  additional  rental
     properties.  The proceeds of these offerings are contributed  to
     DRLP  in exchange for additional interest in the partnership.  A
     summary  of  the  public equity issuances during the  three-year
     period  ended  December  31, 1996 is as follows  (in  thousands,
     except per share price):

       
     During  the  three  years ended December 31, 1996,  the  Company
     acquired a portion of the minority interest in DRLP through  the
     issuance of shares of common stock for a like number of  Limited
     Partner  Units.  The  acquisition of the minority  interest  was
     accounted  for  under the purchase method with  assets  acquired
     recorded at the fair market value of the Company's common  stock
     on  the  date of acquisition. The following acquisition  amounts
     were   allocated  to  rental  property,  undeveloped  land   and
     investments in unconsolidated companies based on their estimated
     fair values (in thousands):

       
                                  - 39 -
     
                                     
               DUKE REALTY INVESTMENTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                                      
                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
     In  August  1996,  the Company issued 300,000  shares  of  9.10%
     Series  A  Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares receiving  net
     proceeds of approximately $72.3 million. On or after August  31,
     2001, the Series A Preferred Shares may be redeemed for cash  at
     the  option  of the Company, in whole or in part at a redemption
     price   of   $250.00   per  share  plus   accrued   and   unpaid
     distributions,  if any, to the redemption date.  The  redemption
     price  of the Series A Preferred Shares (other than any  portion
     thereof consisting of accrued and unpaid distributions) may only
     be  paid  from  the  proceeds of other  capital  shares  of  the
     Company,  which may include other classes or series of preferred
     shares.  The Series A Preferred Shares have no stated  maturity,
     are   not  subject  to  sinking  fund  or  mandatory  redemption
     provisions and are not convertible into any other securities  of
     the  Company. Distributions on the Series A Preferred Shares are
     cumulative  from  the  date of original issue  and  are  payable
     quarterly on or about the last day of February, May, August  and
     November  of each year, commencing on December 2, 1996,  at  the
     rate   of   9.10%  of  the  liquidation  preference  per   annum
     (equivalent to $22.75 per annum per share).
     
  (9) STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
      ------------------------

     The  Company has four stock-based compensation plans, which  are
     described  below.  The Company applies APB Opinion  No.  25  and
     related   Interpretations   in   accounting   for   its   plans.
     Accordingly,  no compensation cost has been recognized  for  its
     fixed  stock  option plans. The Company does charge compensation
     costs  against  its income for its two performance  based  stock
     plans.  If  compensation cost for the Company's four stock-based
     compensation  plans  had been determined  consistent  with  FASB
     Statement  No.  123, the Company's net income and  earnings  per
     share   would  have  been  reduced  to  the  pro  forma  amounts
     indicated below:

     
     The effects of applying FASB Statement No. 123 in this pro forma
     disclosure  are not indicative of future amounts. The  Statement
     does not apply to awards prior to 1995, and additional awards in
     future years are anticipated.
     
     Fixed Stock Option Plans
     ------------------------
     
     The  Company  has two fixed stock option plans, the Duke  Realty
     Services  1993 Stock Option Plan (the "1993 Plan") and the  1995
     Key  Employees'  Stock Option Plan of Duke  Realty  Investments,
     Inc.  (the   "1995 Plan"). Under the 1995 Plan, the  Company  is
     authorized  to grant options to its employees for up to  558,400
     shares  of common stock, as well as up to an additional  400,000
     shares  to  the  extent grants under the 1993  Plan  lapse,  are
     forfeited or are otherwise terminated. The 1995 Plan was adopted
     in  1995,  subject to shareholder approval, which  approval  was
     received  in  1996.  Under  the  1993  Plan,  the  Company   was
     authorized to grant options to its employees for up to 1,315,000
     shares of common stock, of which 751,180 are outstanding  as  of
     December  31,  1996.  Upon the approval of  the  1995  Plan,  no
     further grants are permitted under the 1993 Plan.
                                  - 40 -     
     
     
     
               DUKE REALTY INVESTMENTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                                      
                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                                      
     Under  both plans, the exercise price of each option equals  the
     market  price of the Company's stock on the date of  grant,  and
     each  option's maximum term is ten years. Options granted  under
     the  1993  Plan vest at 20% per year. Options granted under  the
     1995  Plan  vest 50% at the end of the third year following  the
     grant  date,  and  25% per year for each of the  two  succeeding
     years,  or, if earlier, upon the death, retirement or disability
     of the optionee or a change in control of the Company.
     
     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date  of
     grant  using  the Black-Scholes option-pricing  model  with  the
     following assumptions used for grants in 1995 and 1996: Dividend
     yield of 6.0%; expected volatility of 19%; weighted average risk-
     free  interest rates of 6.8% and 5.6% for 1995 and 1996  grants,
     respectively; and weighted average expected lives of  7.8  years
     and 7.9 years for 1995 and 1996 grants, respectively.
     
     A  summary of the status of the Company's two fixed stock  option
     plans  as of December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, and changes during
     the years ended on those dates is as follows:

     The following table summarizes information about fixed stock
     options outstanding at December, 31, 1996:

     
     Performance Based Stock Plans
     -----------------------------
     
     The  Company has two performance based equity compensation plans.
     Under  the  1995  Dividend Increase Unit Plan (the  "DIU  Plan"),
     Dividend  Increase Units ("DIUs") are granted to  key  employees.
     The  value of  DIUs exercised by employees is payable in  company
     stock. A maximum of 100,000 shares of Company stock may be issued
     under  the DIU Plan. The maximum term of all DIUs granted is  ten
     years.
     
                                  - 41 -                                      
     
               DUKE REALTY INVESTMENTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                                      
                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                                      
     The value of each DIU when exercised is equal to the increase in
     the  Company's annualized dividend per share from  the  date  of
     grant  to the date of exercise, divided by the "dividend yield".
     Dividend  yield is the annualized dividend per share divided  by
     the  market price per share of the Company's common stock at the
     date of grant. DIUs are subject to the same vesting schedule  as
     stock options issued under the 1995 Plan. The compensation  cost
     that  has  been  charged against income for  the  DIU  Plan  was
     $152,000 and $39,000 for 1996 and 1995, respectively. A  summary
     of the status of DIUs granted by the Company is as follows:

     
     Under  the  1995  Shareholder Value Plan  (the  "SV  Plan"),  the
     Company  may  grant  awards in specified dollar  amounts  to  key
     employees.  The  award is payable to the employee  on  the  third
     anniversary  of  the  date of grant. One-half  of  the  award  is
     payable  in common stock of the Company, and one-half is  payable
     in  cash.  A  maximum of 100,000 shares of Company stock  may  be
     issued under the SV Plan.
     
     The initial dollar amount of each award granted under the SV Plan
     is  adjusted  upward  or downward based on a  comparison  of  the
     Company's cumulative total shareholder return for the three  year
     period as compared to the cumulative total return of the S&P  500
     and the NAREIT Equity REIT Total Return indices. The award is not
     payable  upon  the employee's termination of employment  for  any
     reason  other than retirement, death, disability or a  change  in
     control of the Company.
     
     The  following  table summarizes information about  the  initial
     amount of SV Plan awards granted in 1995 and 1996:

     
     The  Company  believes  that it is not  possible  to  reasonably
     estimate  the fair value of the common stock to be issued  under
     the  DIU and SV Plans and, therefore, computes compensation cost
     for  the Plans based on the intrinsic value of the awards as  if
     they  were  exercised  at the end of each  applicable  reporting
     period.  The  compensation cost that has  been  charged  against
     income  for the SV Plan was $361,000 and $152,000 for  1996  and
     1995, respectively.
