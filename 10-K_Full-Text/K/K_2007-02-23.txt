PART I

Item 1.

Business

The
    Company.

Kellogg
    Company, founded in 1906 and incorporated in Delaware in 1922,
    and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and
    marketing of

ready-to-eat

cereal and convenience foods.

The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company
    is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek,
    Michigan

49016-3599.

Unless otherwise specified or indicated by the context,
    “Kellogg,” “we,” “us” and
    “our” refer to Kellogg Company, its divisions and
    subsidiaries.

Financial Information About
    Segments.

Information
    on segments is located in Note 14 within Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements which are included herein
    under Part II, Item 8.

Principal
    Products.

Our
    principal products are

ready-to-eat

cereals and convenience foods, such as cookies, crackers,
    toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen waffles and
    veggie foods. These products were, as of December 30, 2006,
    manufactured by us in 17 countries and marketed in more
    than 180 countries. Our cereal products are generally marketed
    under the

Kellogg’s

name and are sold
    principally to the grocery trade through direct sales forces for
    resale to consumers. We use broker and distribution arrangements
    for certain products. We also generally use these, or similar
    arrangements, in less-developed market areas or in those market
    areas outside of our focus.

We also market cookies, crackers, and other convenience foods,
    under brands such as

Kellogg’s, Keebler, Cheez-It,
    Murray, Austin

and

Famous Amos

, to
    supermarkets in the United States through a direct store-door
    (DSD) delivery system, although other distribution methods are
    also used.

Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of our
    products for the years 2004 through 2006 is located in
    Note 14 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which are included herein under Part II,
    Item 8.

Raw
    Materials.

Agricultural
    commodities are the principal raw materials used in our
    products. Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal
    packaging materials used by us. World supplies and prices of
    such commodities (which include such packaging materials) are
    constantly monitored, as are government trade policies. The cost
    of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government
    policy and regulation, weather conditions, or other unforeseen
    circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and
    improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes
    of our short-term and long-term requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the
    United States include corn grits, wheat and wheat derivatives,
    oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean
    derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners, flour, shortening,
    dairy products, eggs, and other filling ingredients, which are
    obtained from various sources. Most of these commodities are
    purchased principally from sources in the United States.

We enter into long-term contracts for the commodities described
    in this section and purchase these items on the open market,
    depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply
    levels, and our relative negotiating power. While the cost of
    some of these commodities has, and may continue to, increase
    over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an
    adequate supply of these items as needed. As further discussed
    herein under Part II, Item 7A, we also use commodity
    futures and options to hedge some of our costs.

Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based
    operations are available in adequate supply and are sometimes
    imported from countries other than those where used in
    manufacturing.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international
    facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane, which
    are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers.
    Short-term standby propane storage exists at several plants for
    use in the event of an interruption in natural gas supplies. Oil
    may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in
    the event of natural gas shortages or when its use presents
    economic advantages. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel
    fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our
    products. As further discussed herein under Part II,
    Item 7A, beginning in 2006, we have used

over-the-counter

commodity price swaps to hedge some of our natural gas costs.

Trademarks and
    Technology.

Generally,
    our products are marketed under trademarks we own. Our principal
    trademarks are our housemarks, brand names, slogans, and designs
    related to cereals and convenience foods manufactured and

The slogans

The Best To You Each Morning, The Original and
    Best

and

They’re Gr-r-reat!

, used in
    connection with our

ready-to-eat

cereals, along with

L’ Eggo my Eggo

,
    used in connection with our frozen waffles and pancakes, and

Elfin Magic

used in connection with convenience
    food products are also important Kellogg trademarks.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when taken as a
    whole, are important to our business. Certain individual
    trademarks are also important to our business. Depending on the
    jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are
    in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained and they have not been
    found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can
    also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks
    are in use.

We consider that, taken as a whole, the rights under our various
    patents, which expire from time to time, are a valuable asset,
    but we do not believe that our businesses are materially
    dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Our
    activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions
    which we hold are similarly a valuable asset, but are not
    believed to be material.

Seasonality.

Demand
    for our products has generally been approximately level
    throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods have
    a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to
    events and holidays. We also custom-bake cookies for the Girl
    Scouts of the U.S.A., which are principally sold in the first
    quarter of the year.

Working
    Capital.

Although
    terms vary around the world and by business types, in the United
    States we generally have required payment for goods sold eleven
    or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as 2% 10/net
    11 or 1% 15/net 16. Receipts from goods sold,
    supplemented as



required by borrowings, provide for our payment of dividends,
    capital expansion, and for other operating expenses and working
    capital needs.

Customers.

Our
    largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated net sales during
    2006, comprised principally of sales within the United States.
    At December 30, 2006, approximately 14% of our consolidated
    receivables balance and 22% of our U.S. receivables balance
    was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
    affiliates. During 2006, our top five customers, collectively,
    accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales
    and approximately 42% of U.S. net sales. There has been
    significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in
    recent years and we believe that this trend is likely to
    continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an
    extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and
    profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a
    significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products
    and our relationships with our customers. Our products have been
    generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker
    and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to
    consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service
    establishments.

Backlog.

For the
    most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and
    are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The
    backlog of any unfilled orders at December 30, 2006 and
    December 31, 2005, was not material to us.

Competition.

We
    have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense
    competition for sales of all of our principal products in our
    major product categories, both domestically and internationally.
    Our products compete with advertised and branded products of a
    similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label
    products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and
    generally with other food products. Principal methods and
    factors of competition include new product introductions,
    product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price,
    advertising, and promotion.

Research and
    Development.

Research
    to support and expand the use of our existing products and to
    develop new food products is carried on at the W.K. Kellogg
    Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek,
    Michigan, and at other locations around the world. Our
    expenditures for research and development were approximately
    $190.6 million in 2006, $181.0 million in 2005 and
    $148.9 million in 2004.

Regulation.

Our
    activities in the United States are subject to regulation by
    various government agencies, including the Food and Drug
    Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the Departments of
    Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation
    by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate
    our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United
    States, including those of the European Union and various
    countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our
    activities.

Environmental
    Matters.

Our
    facilities are subject to various U.S. and foreign federal,
    state, and local laws and regulations regarding the discharge of
    material into the environment and the protection of the
    environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material
    proceedings arising under these regulations. We believe that
    compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will
    not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or
    our competitive position.

Employees.

At
    December 30, 2006, we had approximately 26,000 employees.

Financial Information About Geographic
    Areas.

Information
    on geographic areas is located in Note 14 within Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein

    or words or phrases of similar meaning. For example,
    forward-looking statements are found in this Item 1 and in
    several sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
    Our actual results or activities may differ materially from
    these predictions. Our future results could be affected by a
    variety of factors, including the impact of competitive
    conditions; the effectiveness of pricing, advertising, and
    promotional programs; the success of innovation and new product
    introductions; the recoverability of the carrying value of
    goodwill and other intangibles; the success of productivity
    improvements and business transitions; commodity and energy
    prices, and labor costs; the availability of and interest rates
    on short-term and long-term financing; actual market performance
    of benefit plan trust investments; the levels of spending on
    systems initiatives, properties, business opportunities,
    integration of acquired businesses, and other general and
    administrative costs; changes in consumer behavior and
    preferences; the effect of U.S. and foreign economic conditions
    on items such as interest rates, statutory tax rates, currency
    conversion and availability; legal and regulatory factors;
    business disruption or other losses from war, terrorist acts, or
    political unrest and the risks and uncertainties described in
    Item 1A below. Forward-looking statements speak only as of
    the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to
    publicly update them.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report,
    the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely
    affect our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently
    known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair
    our business operations and financial condition.

Our performance is affected by general economic and political
    conditions and taxation policies.

Our results in the past have been, and in the future may
    continue to be, materially affected by changes in general
    economic and political conditions in the United States and other
    countries, including the interest rate environment in which we
    conduct business, the financial markets through which we access
    capital and currency, political unrest and terrorist acts in the
    United States or other countries in which we carry on business.

The enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added
    tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in
    markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the
    future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our
    products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or
    on our results of operations.

We operate in the highly competitive food industry.

We face competition across our product lines, including

ready-to-eat

cereals and convenience foods, from other companies which have
    varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions.
    Some of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing
    and other resources, and competition with them in our various
    markets and



product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital,
    marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share, any of
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business and
    financial results. Category share and growth could also be
    adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new
    products.

Our consolidated financial results and demand for our
    products are dependent on the successful development of new
    products and processes.

There are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may
    impact us and the industry as a whole. These include changing
    consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute
    products.

Our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer
    preferences and on successful new product and process
    development and product relaunches in response to such changes.
    We aim to introduce products or new or improved production
    processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence
    and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote
    significant focus to the development of new products and to the
    research, development and technology process functions of our
    business, we may not be successful in developing new products or
    our new products may not be commercially successful. Our future
    results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive
    position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of
    our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify,
    develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products
    in these changing markets.

An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other
    acquired intangible could negatively affect our consolidated
    operating results and net worth.

The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of
    acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and
    liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of
    other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, trade
    names, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition
    date. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to
    contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but
    must be evaluated by management at least annually for
    impairment. If carrying value exceeds current fair value, the
    intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value
    via a charge to earnings. Events and conditions which could
    result in an impairment include changes in the industries in
    which we operate, including competition and advances in
    technology; a significant product liability or intellectual
    property claim; or other factors leading to reduction in
    expected sales or profitability. Should the value of one or more
    of the acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated
    earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected.

As of December 30, 2006, the carrying value of intangible
    assets totaled approximately $4.87 billion, of which
    $3.45 billion was goodwill and $1.42 billion
    represented trademarks, tradenames, and other acquired
    intangibles compared to total assets of $10.71 billion and
    shareholders’ equity of $2.07 billion.

We may not achieve our targeted cost savings from cost
    reduction initiatives.

Our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient
    producer in a highly competitive industry. We have invested a
    significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our
    operational facilities. Ongoing operational issues are likely to
    occur when carrying out major production, procurement, or
    logistical changes and these, as well as any failure by us to
    achieve our planned cost savings, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business and consolidated financial position and
    on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness.

We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our
    shareholders’ equity. As of December 30, 2006, we had
    total debt of approximately $5.04 billion and
    shareholders’ equity of $2.07 billion.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences,
    including:

•

the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital,
    capital expenditure or general corporate purposes may be
    impaired, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt
    securities by rating organizations were revised downward;

•

restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market
    conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a
    general downturn in economic conditions or our business;

•

a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations must be
    dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt,
    reducing the funds available to us for other purposes including
    expansion through acquisitions, marketing spending and expansion
    of our product offerings; and

•

we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may
    place us at a competitive disadvantage.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our
    obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our
    financial and operating performance, which in turn, is subject



to prevailing economic conditions, the availability of, and
    interest rates on,

short-term

financing, and to financial, business and other factors beyond
    our control.

Our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a
    result of increases in the price of raw materials, including
    agricultural commodities, fuel and labor.

Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, soybean oil,
    sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our
    products. Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal
    packaging materials used by us. The cost of such commodities may
    fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation,
    weather conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. To the
    extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of
    such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or
    adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that
    offsets such changes, the results of our operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international
    facilities are regularly fuelled by natural gas or propane,
    which are obtained from local utilities or other local
    suppliers. Short-term stand-by propane storage exists at several
    plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies.
    Oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various
    plants. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are
    used in connection with the distribution of our products. The
    cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political
    conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other
    unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated operating results or financial
    condition.

A shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary
    pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could
    increase labor cost, which could have a material adverse effect
    on our consolidated operating results or financial conditions.

Additionally, our labor costs include the cost of providing
    benefits for employees. We sponsor a number of defined benefit
    plans for employees in the United States and various foreign
    locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active
    health care, severance and other postemployment benefits. We
    also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for
    certain of our manufacturing locations. Our major pension plans
    and U.S. retiree health and welfare plans are funded with
    trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of
    equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate
    and other investments. The annual cost of benefits can vary
    significantly from year to year and is materially affected by
    such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return
    on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount
    rate used to measure obligations, the rate or trend of health
    care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained
    wage and benefit agreements.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face
    of a consolidating retail environment. In addition, the loss of
    one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales
    and profits.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated net sales during
    2006, comprised principally of sales within the United States.
    At December 30, 2006, approximately 14% of our consolidated
    receivables balance and 22% of our U.S. receivables balance
    was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
    affiliates. During 2006, our top five customers, collectively,
    accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales
    and approximately 42% of U.S. net sales. As the retail
    grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become
    larger, our large retail customers may seek to use their
    position to improve their profitability through improved
    efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If
    we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product
    innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our
    profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. The
    loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could
    negatively impact our sales and profits.

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any
    inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products
    and brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, including
    particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also including
    patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to
    be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt
    to protect our intellectual property rights through a
    combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret
    laws, as well as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure
    and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of
    our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately
    protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products,
    or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that
    serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our
    intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and
    could materially harm our business.

We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that
    may cover some of our technology, brands or products.



Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property
    could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the
    attention of our management and key personnel from our business
    operations. Third party claims of intellectual property
    infringement might also require us to enter into costly license
    agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or
    injunctions against development and sale of certain products.

Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure
    to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations
    and laws could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial condition.

Our activities, both in and outside of the United States, are
    subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and
    local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Federal Trade
    Commission, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce
    and Labor, as well as similar and other authorities of the
    European Union and various state, provincial and local
    governments, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies.
    Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities.

The manufacturing, marketing and distribution of food products
    is subject to governmental regulation that is becoming
    increasingly onerous. Those regulations control such matters as
    ingredients, advertising, relations with distributors and
    retailers, health and safety and the environment. We are also
    regulated with respect to matters such as licensing
    requirements, trade and pricing practices, tax and environmental
    matters. The need to comply with new or revised tax,
    environmental or other laws or regulations, or new or changed
    interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations,
    may have a material adverse effect on our business and results
    of operations.

Our operations face significant foreign currency exchange
    rate exposure which could negatively impact our operating
    results.

We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay
    expenses in a variety of currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian
    dollar, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Because our
    consolidated financial statements are presented in
    U.S. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities,
    revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable
    exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the
    value of the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of
    these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if
    their value has not changed in their original currency. To the
    extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure
    adequately, our consolidated results of operations may be
    negatively affected.

If our food products become adulterated or misbranded, we
    might need to recall those items and may experience product
    liability if consumers are injured as a result.

We may need to recall some of our products if they become
    adulterated or misbranded. We may also be liable if the
    consumption of any of our products causes injury. A widespread
    product recall could result in significant losses due to the
    costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and
    lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of
    time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product
    liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or
    product liability case could also result in a loss of consumer
    confidence in our food products, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business results and the value of our
    brands.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters and principal research and
    development facilities are located in Battle Creek, Michigan.

We operated, as of December 30, 2006, manufacturing plants
    and distribution and warehousing facilities totaling more than
    28 million square feet of building area in the United
    States and other countries. Our plants have been designed and
    constructed to meet our specific production requirements, and we
    periodically invest money for capital and technological
    improvements. At the time of its selection, each location was
    considered to be favorable, based on the location of markets,
    sources of raw materials, availability of suitable labor,
    transportation facilities, location of our other plants
    producing similar products, and other factors. Our manufacturing
    facilities in the United States include four cereal plants and
    warehouses located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster,
    Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska and other
    plants in San Jose, California; Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus,
    and Rome, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Kansas City, Kansas;
    Florence, Louisville, and Pikeville, Kentucky; Grand Rapids,
    Michigan; Blue Anchor, New Jersey; Cary and Charlotte, North
    Carolina; Cincinnati, Fremont, and Zanesville, Ohio; Muncy,
    Pennsylvania; Rossville, Tennessee and Allyn, Washington.

Outside the United States, we had, as of December 30, 2006,
    additional manufacturing locations, some with warehousing
    facilities, in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador,



Germany, Great Britain, Guatemala, India, Japan, Mexico, South
    Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and Venezuela.

We generally own our principal properties, including our major
    office facilities, although some manufacturing facilities are
    leased, and no owned property is subject to any major lien or
    other encumbrance. Distribution facilities (including related
    warehousing facilities) and offices of non-plant locations
    typically are leased. In general, we consider our facilities,
    taken as a whole, to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient
    capacity for our current operations.

Kellogg Company
    and Subsidiaries

Results Of
    Operations

Overview

Kellogg Company is the world’s leading producer of cereal
    and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies,
    crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen
    waffles, and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and
    marketed globally. We currently manage our operations in four
    geographic operating segments, comprised of North America
    and the three International operating segments of Europe,
    Latin America, and Asia Pacific. For the periods presented,
    the Asia Pacific operating segment included Australia and Asian
    markets. Beginning in 2007, this segment will also include
    South Africa, which was formerly a part of Europe.

We manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our
    long-term annual growth targets. During the periods presented,
    these targets were low single-digit for internal net sales, mid
    single-digit for internal operating profit, and high
    single-digit for net earnings per share, which we met or
    exceeded in each of 2004, 2005, and 2006:

    acquisitions, dispositions, and shipping day differences.
    Specifically, internal net sales and operating profit growth for
    2005 and 2004 exclude the impact of a 53rd shipping week in
    2004. Internal operating profit growth for 2006 also excludes
    the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R)
    “Share-Based Payment.” Accordingly, internal operating
    profit growth for 2006 is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is
    further discussed and reconciled to GAAP-basis growth on
    pages 11 and 12.

(b)

At the beginning of 2006, we
    adopted SFAS No. 123(R) “Share-Based
    Payment,” which reduced our fiscal 2006 operating profit by
    $65.4 million ($42.4 million after tax or
    $.11 per share), due primarily to recognition of
    compensation expense associated with employee and director stock
    option grants. Correspondingly, our reported operating profit
    and net earnings growth for 2006 was reduced by approximately
    4%. Diluted net earnings per share growth was reduced by
    approximately 5%. Refer to the section beginning on page 21
    entitled “

Stock compensation

” for further
    information on the Company’s adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

In combination with an attractive dividend yield, we believe
    this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong
    total return to our shareholders. We plan to continue to achieve
    this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our
    cereal business, expanding our snacks business, and pursuing
    selected growth opportunities. We support our business strategy
    with operating principles that emphasize profit-rich,
    sustainable sales growth, as well as cash flow and return on
    invested capital. We believe our steady earnings growth, strong
    cash flow, and continued investment during a multi-year period
    of significant commodity and energy-driven cost inflation
    demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model.

We measure the volume impact
    (tonnage) on revenues based on the stated weight of our product
    shipments.

During 2006, our consolidated net sales increased 7%, with
    strong results in both North America and the total of our
    International segments. Internal net sales also grew 7%,
    building on a 6% rate of internal growth during 2005. Successful
    innovation, brand-building (advertising and consumer promotion)
    investment, and in-store execution continued to drive
    broad-based sales growth across each



of our enterprise-wide product groups. In fact, we achieved
    growth in retail cereal sales within each of our operating
    segments.

For 2006, our North America operating segment reported a net
    sales increase of 8%. Internal net sales growth was also 8%,
    with each major product group contributing as follows: retail
    cereal +3%; retail snacks (cookies, crackers, toaster pastries,
    cereal bars, fruit snacks) +11%; frozen and specialty (food
    service, vending, convenience, drug stores, custom
    manufacturing) channels +8%. The significant growth achieved by
    our North America snacks business represented nearly one-half of
    the total dollar increase in consolidated internal net sales for
    2006. The 2006 growth in North America retail cereal sales was
    on top of 8% growth in 2005 and represented the
    6th consecutive year in which we’ve increased our
    dollar share of category sales. Although North America consumer
    retail cereal consumption remained steady throughout 2006, our
    shipment revenues declined in the fourth quarter of 2006 by
    approximately 2% versus the prior-year period. We believe this
    decline was largely attributable to year-end retail trade
    inventory adjustments, which brought inventories in line with
    year-end 2005 levels after several successive quarters of slight
    inclines.

Our International operating segments collectively achieved net
    sales growth of approximately 6% or 5% on an internal basis,
    with leading dollar contributions from our UK, France, Mexico,
    and Venezuela business units. Internal sales of our Asia Pacific
    operating segment (which represents less than 5% of our
    consolidated results) were approximately even with the prior
    year, as solid growth in Australia cereal and Asian markets was
    offset by weak performance in our Australia snack business.

Consolidated operating profit for 2006 grew 1%, with internal
    operating profit up 4% versus 2005. As discussed on
    page 11, our measure of internal operating profit growth is
    consistent with our measure of internal sales growth, except
    that during 2006, internal operating profit growth also excluded
    the impact of incremental stock compensation expense associated
    with our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We used this
    non-GAAP financial measure during our first year of adopting
    this FASB standard in order to assist management and investors
    in assessing the Company’s financial operating performance
    against comparative periods, which did not include stock
    option-related compensation expense. Accordingly, corporate
    selling, general, and administrative (SGA) expense was higher
    and operating profit was lower by $65.4 million for 2006,
    reducing consolidated operating profit growth by approximately
    four percentage points. Refer to the section beginning on
    page 21 entitled “

Stock compensation

” for
    further information on the Company’s adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

As further discussed beginning on page 14, our measure of
    internal operating profit growth includes up-front costs related
    to cost-reduction initiatives. Although total 2006 up-front
    costs of $82 million were not significantly changed from
    the 2005 amount of $90 million, a

year-over-year

shift in operating segment allocation of such costs affected
    relative segment performance. The 2006 versus 2005 change in
    project cost allocation was a $44 million decline in North
    America (improving 2006 segment operating profit performance by
    approximately 4%) and a $28 million increase in Europe
    (reducing 2006 segment operating profit performance by
    approximately 8%).

Our current-year operating profit growth was affected by
    significant cost pressures as discussed in the “

Margin
    performance

” section beginning on page 13.
    Expenditures for brand-building activities increased at a low
    single-digit rate; this rate of growth incorporates savings
    reinvestment from our recent focus on media buying efficiencies
    and global leverage of promotional campaigns. Within our total
    brand-building metric, advertising expenditures grew at a high
    single-digit rate for 2006, which is a dynamic that we expect to
    continue through 2007 due to a relatively heavier focus on
    promotional efficiencies. Consistent with our long-term
    commitment, we expect to return to higher rates of growth for
    total brand-building expenditures, beginning in 2008.

During 2005, consolidated net sales increased nearly 6%.
    Internal net sales also grew approximately 6%, which was on top
    of 5% internal sales growth in 2004.

For 2005, successful innovation and brand-building investment
    drove strong growth across our North American business units,
    which collectively reported a 7% increase in net sales versus
    2004. Internal net sales of our North America retail cereal
    business increased 8%, with strong performance in both the
    United States and Canada. Internal net sales of our North
    America retail snacks business increased 7% on top of 8% growth
    in 2004. This growth was attributable principally to sales of
    fruit snacks, toaster pastries, cracker products, and major
    cookie brands. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact
    of proactively managing discontinuation of marginal cookie
    innovations. Internal net sales of our North America frozen and
    specialty channel businesses collectively increased
    approximately 8%, led by solid contributions from our

Eggo

®

frozen foods and food service businesses.

In 2005, our International operating segments collectively
    achieved net sales growth of nearly 4% on both a reported and
    internal basis, with our Latin America operating segment
    contributing approximately two-thirds of the total dollar
    increase. Nevertheless, we achieved our long-term annual growth
    targets of low single-digit for internal net sales in our Europe
    and Asia Pacific operating segments due primarily to solid
    innovation performance in southern Europe and Asia.

Consolidated operating profit increased 4% during 2005, with our
    Europe operating segment contributing approximately one-half of
    the total dollar increase. This disproportionate contribution
    was attributable to a

year-over-year

shift in segment allocation of charges from cost-reduction
    initiatives. As discussed in the section beginning on
    page 14, the 2005 versus 2004 change in project cost
    allocation was a $65 million decline in Europe (improving
    2005 segment operating profit performance by approximately 22%)
    and a $46 million increase in North America (reducing 2005
    segment operating profit performance by approximately 4%).

Internal growth in consolidated operating profit was 5%. This
    internal growth was achieved despite-double digit growth in
    brand-building and innovation expenditures and significant cost
    pressures on gross margin, as discussed in the following
    section. During 2005, we increased our consolidated
    brand-building (advertising and consumer promotion) expenditures
    by more than


/


times
    the rate of sales growth.

Corporate operating profit for 2004 included a charge of
    $9.5 million related to CEO transition expenses, which
    arose from the departure of Carlos Gutierrez, the Company’s
    former CEO, related to his appointment as U.S. Secretary of
    Commerce in early 2005. The total charge (net of forfeitures) of
    $9.5 million was comprised principally of $3.7 million
    for special pension termination benefits and $5.5 million
    for accelerated vesting of 606,250 stock options. Segment
    operating profit for 2004 included intangibles impairment losses
    of $10.4 million, comprised of $7.9 million to write
    off the carrying value of a contract-based intangible asset in
    North America and $2.5 million to write off goodwill in
    Latin America.

We strive for gross margin expansion to reinvest in
    brand-building and innovation expenditures. Our strategy for
    expanding our gross margin is to manage external cost pressures
    through product pricing and mix improvements, productivity
    savings, and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of
    product ingredients and packaging.

Our gross margin performance for 2005 and 2006 reflects the
    impact of significant fuel, energy, and commodity price
    inflation experienced throughout most of that time, as well as
    increased employee benefit costs. In the aggregate, these input
    cost pressures reduced our consolidated gross margin by
    approximately 150 basis points for 2006 and 60 basis
    points in 2005. For 2006, our gross margin performance was also
    unfavorably impacted by incremental logistics and



innovation

start-up

costs related to the recent, significant sales growth within our
    North America operating segment.

While the majority of the inflationary pressure during 2005 and
    2006 was commodity and energy-driven, employee benefit costs
    (the majority of which are recorded in cost of goods sold) also
    increased during that time period, with total active and retired
    employee benefits expense reaching approximately
    $325 million in 2006 versus $290 million in 2005 and
    $260 million in 2004. For 2007, the combined effect of
    favorable trust asset performance and rising interest rates is
    expected to have a moderating effect on underlying health care
    cost inflation. As a result, we expect 2007 benefits expense to
    be approximately even with the 2006 amount.

For 2007, we expect this inflationary trend to continue, with
    input cost (fuel, energy, commodity, and benefits) pressures
    forecasted to exceed realized savings. As compared to 2006
    results, we currently expect $110-$130 million of
    incremental cost inflation, primarily associated with the prices
    of our 2007 ingredient purchases. Accordingly, we believe our
    2007 consolidated gross margin could decline by up to
    50 basis points.

In addition to external cost pressures, our discretionary
    investment in cost-reduction initiatives (refer to following
    section) has created variability in our gross margin performance
    during the periods presented. Although total annual
    program-related charges were relatively steady over the past
    several years, the amount recorded in cost of goods sold varied
    by year (in millions): 2006−$74; 2005−$90;
    2004−$46. Additionally, cost of goods sold for 2005
    includes a charge of approximately $12 million, related to
    a lump-sum payment to members of the major union representing
    the hourly employees at our U.S. cereal plants for
    ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the Company
    covering the four-year period ended October 2009.

For 2006, both our SGA% and operating  margin were affected by
    our fiscal 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). During
    2006, we reported incremental stock compensation expense of
    $65.4 million, which increased our SGA% and reduced our
    operating margin by approximately 60 basis points. Refer to
    the section beginning on page 21 entitled “

Stock
    compensation

” for further information on this subject.

Cost-reduction
    initiatives

We view our continued spending on cost-reduction initiatives as
    part of our ongoing operating principles to reinvest earnings so
    as to provide greater reliability in meeting long-term growth
    targets. Initiatives undertaken must meet certain pay-back and
    internal rate of return (IRR) targets. We currently require each
    project to recover total cash implementation costs within a
    five-year period of completion or to achieve an IRR of at least
    20%. Each cost-reduction initiative is normally one to three
    years in duration. Upon completion (or as each major stage is
    completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project
    begins to deliver cash savings

and/or

reduced depreciation, which is then used to fund new
    initiatives. To implement these programs, the Company has
    incurred various up-front costs, including asset write-offs,
    exit charges, and other project expenditures, which we include
    in our measure and discussion of operating segment profitability
    within the “

Net sales and operating
    profit

” section beginning on page 11.

In 2006, we commenced a multi-year European manufacturing
    optimization plan to improve utilization of our facility in
    Manchester, England and to better align production in Europe.
    Based on forecasted foreign exchange rates, the Company
    currently expects to incur approximately $60 million in
    total up-front costs (including those already incurred in 2006),
    comprised of approximately 80% cash and 20% non-cash asset
    write-offs, to complete this initiative. The cash portion of the
    total up-front costs results principally from our plan to
    eliminate approximately 220 hourly and salaried positions
    from the Manchester facility by the end of 2008 through
    voluntary early retirement and severance programs. For 2006, we
    incurred approximately $28 million of total up-front costs
    and expect to incur a similar amount in 2007, leaving a
    relatively insignificant amount to be incurred in 2008. Cash
    requirements for this initiative are expected to exceed
    projected cash charges by approximately $10 million in
    total due to incremental pension trust funding requirements of
    early retirements; most of this incremental funding occurred in
    2006.

Also during 2006, we implemented several short-term initiatives
    to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our
    U.S. cereal manufacturing network and streamlined our sales
    distribution system in a Latin American market. In 2005, we
    undertook an initiative to consolidate U.S. snacks bakery
    capacity, resulting in the closure and sale of two facilities by
    mid 2006. Major initiatives commenced in 2004 were the global
    rollout of the SAP information technology system, reorganization
    of pan-European operations, consolidation of U.S. veggie
    foods manufacturing operations, and relocation of our
    U.S. snacks business unit to Battle Creek, Michigan. Except
    for the aforementioned European manufacturing optimization plan,
    our other initiatives were substantially complete at
    December 30, 2006. Details of each initiative are described
    in Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



For 2006, the Company recorded total program-related charges of
    approximately $82 million, comprised of $20 million of
    asset write-offs, $30 million for severance and other exit
    costs, $9 million for other cash expenditures,
    $4 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal
    liability, and $19 million for pension and other
    postretirement plan curtailment losses and special termination
    benefits. Approximately $74 million of the total 2006
    charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within operating
    segment results, with approximately $8 million recorded in
    SGA expense within corporate results. The Company’s
    operating segments were impacted as follows (in millions): North
    America−$46; Europe−$28.

For 2005, total program-related charges were approximately
    $90 million, comprised of $16 million for a
    multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability,
    $44 million of asset write-offs, $21 million in
    severance and other exit costs, and $9 million for other
    cash expenditures. All of the charges were recorded in cost of
    goods sold within our North America operating segment.

For 2004, total program-related charges were approximately
    $109 million, comprised of $41 million in asset
    write-offs, $1 million for special pension termination
    benefits, $15 million in severance and other exit costs,
    and $52 million in other cash expenditures such as
    relocation and consulting. Approximately $46 million of the
    total 2004 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold, with
    approximately $63 million recorded in SGA expense. The 2004
    charges impacted our operating segments as follows (in
    millions): North America−$44; Europe−$65.

For the periods presented, cash requirements to implement these
    programs approximated the exit costs and other cash charges
    incurred in each year, except for approximately $8 million
    of incremental pension trust funding that occurred in 2006 in
    connection with the European manufacturing optimization plan. At
    December 30, 2006, the Company’s remaining cash
    commitments to complete the executed programs were comprised of:
    1) exit cost reserves of $14 million expected to be
    paid out in 2007; 2) approximately $25 million of
    projected spending and pension trust funding during 2007 and
    2008 associated with the European manufacturing optimization
    plan; and 3) an estimated multiemployer pension plan
    withdrawal liability of $20 million, which will not be
    finally determined until 2008 and once determined, is payable to
    the pension fund over a

20-year

maximum period. We expect these cash requirements to be funded
    by operating cash flow.

Our 2007 earnings target includes total projected charges
    related to in-progress and potential cost-reduction initiatives
    of approximately $80 million or $.14 per share.
    Approximately one-third of this total is allocated to the
    European manufacturing optimization plan. However, the specific
    cash versus non-cash mix or cost of goods sold versus SGA
    expense impact of the remainder has not yet been determined.
    Other potential initiatives to be commenced in 2007 are still in
    the planning stages and individual actions will be announced as
    we commit to these discretionary investments.

Interest
    expense

As illustrated in the following table, annual interest expense
    for the

2004-2006

period has been relatively steady at approximately
    $300 million per year, which reflects a stable effective
    interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt
    balance throughout most of that time. Interest income (recorded
    in other income) has trended upward from approximately
    $7 million in 2004 to $11 million in 2006, resulting
    in net interest expense of approximately $296 million for
    2006. We currently expect that our 2007 net interest
    expense will approximate the 2006 level.

    gains and losses. Other income (expense), net for the periods
    presented was (in millions): 2006−$13.2;
    2005−($24.9); 2004−($6.6). The variability in other
    income (expense), net, among years reflects the timing of
    certain significant charges explained in the following paragraph
    and net foreign exchange transaction losses included therein of
    (in millions): 2006−$2; 2005−$2; 2004−$15.

Other expense includes charges for contributions to the
    Kellogg’s Corporate Citizenship Fund, a private trust
    established for charitable giving, as follows (in millions):
    2006−$3; 2005−$16; 2004−$9. Other expense for
    2005 also includes a charge of approximately $7 million to
    reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to
    estimated selling value. This facility was sold in August 2006.



Income
    taxes

Our long-term objective is to achieve a consolidated effective
    income tax rate of approximately

31-32%.

In
    comparison to a U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of
    35%, we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move
    toward our long-term target. Excluding the impact of discrete
    adjustments, our sustainable consolidated effective income tax
    rate for both 2006 and 2005 was approximately 33%, which is what
    we currently expect for 2007. Our reported rates of
    approximately 32% for 2006 and 31% for 2005 were lower due to
    the favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as
    audit settlements, statutory rate changes, and other deferred
    tax liability adjustments. (Refer to Note 11 within Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.)
    Similarly, our 2007 consolidated effective income tax rate could
    be up to 200 basis points lower than the aforementioned
    sustainable rate if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax
    positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are
    resolved more favorably than we currently expect. We expect that
    any incremental benefits from such discrete events would be
    invested in cost-reduction initiatives and other growth
    opportunities.

The consolidated effective income tax rate for 2004 of nearly
    35% was higher than the rates for 2006 and 2005 primarily
    because this period preceded the final reorganization of our
    European operations which favorably affected the
    country-weighting impact on our rate. (Refer to Note 3
    within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information on this initiative.) Additionally, the 2004
    consolidated effective income tax rate included a provision of
    approximately $28 million (net of related foreign tax
    credits) for approximately $1.1 billion of dividends from
    foreign subsidiaries which we elected to repatriate in 2005
    under the American Jobs Creation Act. Finally, 2005 was the
    first year in which we were permitted to claim a phased-in
    deduction from U.S. taxable income equal to a stipulated
    percentage of qualified production income (“QPI”).

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows,
    supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other
    significant transactions. This cash-generating capability is one
    of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial
    financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.
    The principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings,
    meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of
    costs to manufacture and market our products. Our cash
    conversion cycle is relatively short; although receivable
    collection patterns vary around the world, in the United States,
    our days sales outstanding (DSO) averaged approximately
    19 days during the periods presented. As a result, our
    operating cash flow should generally reflect our net earnings
    performance over time, although, as illustrated in the following
    schedule, specific results for any particular year may be
    significantly affected by the level of benefit plan
    contributions, working capital movements (operating assets and
    liabilities) and other factors.

Our operating cash flow for 2006 was approximately
    $267 million higher than 2005, due primarily to lower
    benefit plan contributions, partially offset by unfavorable
    working capital movements. Correspondingly, operating cash flow
    for 2005 was approximately $86 million lower than 2004, due
    principally to a significant increase in benefit plan
    contributions. The decline in benefit plan contributions for
    2006 reflects the improved funded position of our major benefit
    plans that was achieved through a significant amount of funding
    in the

2003-2005

period.

On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act (PPA) became
    law in the United States. The PPA revised the basis and
    methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding
    requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits
    paid from tax-qualified plans. Most of these provisions are
    first applicable to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans
    in 2008 on a phased-in basis. The PPA will ultimately require us
    to make additional contributions to our U.S. plans.
    However, due to our historical



funding practices, we currently believe that we will not be
    required to make any contributions under the new PPA
    requirements until after 2012. Accordingly, we do not expect to
    have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements
    for our major retiree benefit plans during the next several
    years, with total 2007 U.S. and foreign plan contributions
    currently estimated at approximately $54 million. Actual
    2007 contributions could exceed our current projections, as
    influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of
    our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities,
    future changes in government requirements, renewals of union
    contracts, or

higher-than-expected

health care claims experience. Additionally, our projections
    concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to
    change primarily based on general market conditions affecting
    trust asset performance and our future decisions regarding
    certain elective provisions of the PPA.

In comparison to 2005, the unfavorable movement in core working
    capital during 2006 was related to trade payables performance
    and higher inventory balances. At December 30, 2006, our
    consolidated trade payables balance was within 3% of the balance
    at year-end 2005. In contrast, our trade payables balance
    increased approximately 22% during 2005, from a historically-low
    level at the end of 2004. The higher inventory balance was
    principally related to higher commodity prices for our raw
    material and packaging inventories and to a lesser extent, the
    overall increase in the average number of weeks of inventory on
    hand. Our consolidated inventory balances were unfavorably
    affected by U.S. capacity limitations during 2006;
    nevertheless, our consolidated inventory balances remain at
    industry-leading levels.

Despite the unfavorable movement in the absolute balance,
    average core working capital continues to improve as a
    percentage of net sales. For the trailing fifty-two weeks ended
    December 30, 2006, core working capital was 6.8% of net
    sales, as compared to 7.0% as of year-end 2005 and 7.3% as of
    year-end 2004. We have achieved this multi-year reduction
    primarily through faster collection of accounts receivable and
    extension of terms on trade payables. Up until 2006, we had also
    been successful in implementing logistics improvements to reduce
    inventory on hand while continuing to meet customer
    requirements. We believe the opportunity to reduce inventory
    from year-end 2006 levels could represent a source of operating
    cash flow during 2007.

For 2005, the net favorable movement in core working capital was
    related to the aforementioned increase in trade payables,
    partially offset by an unfavorable movement in trade
    receivables, which returned to historical levels (in relation to
    sales) in early 2005 from lower levels at the end of 2004. We
    believe these lower levels were related to the timing of our
    53rd week over the 2004 holiday period, which impacted the
    core working capital component of our operating cash flow
    throughout 2005.

As presented in the table on page 16, other working capital
    was a source of cash in 2006 versus a use of cash in 2005. The

year-over-year

favorable variance of approximately $116 million was
    attributable to several factors including lower debt-related
    currency swap payments in 2006 as well as business-related
    growth in accrued compensation and promotional liabilities. The
    unfavorable movement in other working capital for 2004, as
    compared to succeeding years, primarily relates to a decrease in
    current income tax liabilities which is offset in the deferred
    income taxes line item.

Our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash
    provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for
    property additions. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of
    cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of
    cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions,
    acquisition opportunities, and share repurchase. Our cash flow
    metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as
    follows:

Our 2006 and 2005 cash flow (as defined) performance reflects
    increased spending for selected capacity expansions to
    accommodate our Company’s strong sales growth over the past
    several years. This increased capital spending represented 4.2%
    of net sales in 2006 and 3.7% of net sales in 2005, as compared
    to 2.9% in 2004. For 2007, we  currently expect property
    expenditures to remain at approximately 4% of net sales, which
    is consistent with our long-term target for capital spending.
    This forecast includes expenditures associated with the
    construction of a new manufacturing facility in Ontario, Canada,
    which represents approximately 15% of our 2007 capital plan.
    This facility is being constructed to satisfy existing capacity
    needs in our North America business, which we believe will
    partially ease certain of the aforementioned logistics and
    inventory management issues which we encountered during 2006.

For 2007, we are targeting cash flow of
    $950-$1,025 million. We expect to achieve our target
    principally through operating



profit growth, which is forecasted to offset higher levels of
    capital spending and income tax payments during 2007.

In order to support the continued growth of our North American
    fruit snacks business, we completed two separate business
    acquisitions during 2005 for a total of approximately
    $50 million in cash, including related transaction costs.
    In June 2005, we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility
    and related assets from Kraft Foods Inc. The facility is located
    in Chicago, Illinois and employs approximately 400 active hourly
    and salaried employees. In November 2005, we acquired
    substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a
    Washington State-based manufacturer of natural and organic fruit
    snacks.

For 2006, our Board of Directors authorized stock repurchases
    for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for
    employee benefit programs of up to $650 million, which we
    spent to repurchase approximately 14.9 million shares. This
    activity consisted principally of a February 2006 private
    transaction with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust
    (“the Trust”) to repurchase approximately
    12.8 million shares for $550 million. Pursuant to
    similar Board authorizations applicable to those years, we paid
    $664 million in 2005 to repurchase approximately
    15.4 million shares and $298 million in 2004 for
    approximately 7.3 million shares. The 2005 activity
    consisted principally of a November 2005 private transaction
    with the Trust to repurchase approximately 9.4 million
    shares for $400 million. For 2007, our Board of Directors
    has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to
    $650 million.

In July 2005, we redeemed $723.4 million of long-term debt,
    representing the remaining principal balance of our 6.0%
    U.S. Dollar Notes due April 2006. In October 2005, we
    repaid $200 million of maturing 4.875% U.S. Dollar
    Notes. In December 2005, we redeemed $35.4 million of
    U.S. Dollar Notes due June 2008. These payments were funded
    principally through issuance of U.S. Dollar short-term debt.

During November 2005, subsidiaries of the Company issued
    approximately $930 million of foreign currency-denominated
    debt in offerings outside of the United States, consisting of
    Euro 550 million of floating rate notes due 2007 (the
    “Euro Notes”) and approximately C$330 million of
    Canadian commercial paper. These debt issuances were guaranteed
    by the Company and net proceeds were used primarily for the
    payment of dividends pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act
    and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect
    subsidiaries of the Company, as well as for general corporate
    purposes.

To utilize excess cash and reduce financing costs, on
    January 31, 2007, we announced an early redemption of the
    Euro Notes, effective February 28, 2007. To partially
    refinance this redemption, we established a program to issue
    euro-commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount
    outstanding at any time of $750 million or its equivalent
    in alternative currencies. The notes may have maturities ranging
    up to 364 days and will be senior unsecured obligations of
    the applicable issuer, with subsidiary issuances guaranteed by
    the Company. In connection with these financing activities, we
    increased our short-term lines of credit from $2.2 billion
    at December 30, 2006 to approximately $2.6 billion,
    via a $400 million unsecured

364-Day

Credit Agreement effective January 31, 2007. The

364-Day

Agreement contains customary covenants, warranties, and
    restrictions similar to those applicable to our existing
    $2.0 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in
    2011. These facilities are available for general corporate
    purposes, including commercial paper

back-up,

although the Company does not currently anticipate any usage
    under the facilities. (Refer to Note 7 within Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our
    debt issuances and credit facilities.)

At December 30, 2006, our total debt was approximately
    $5.0 billion, approximately even with the balances at
    year-end 2005 and 2004. During 2005, we increased our benefit
    trust investments through plan funding by approximately 13%,
    reduced the Company’s common stock outstanding through
    repurchase programs by approximately 4%, and implemented a
    mid-year increase in the shareholder dividend level of
    approximately 10%. Similarly, during 2006, we further reduced
    our common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by
    approximately 4% and implemented a mid-year increase in the
    shareholder dividend level of approximately 5%. Primarily due to
    the prioritization of these uses of cash flow, plus the
    aforementioned need to selectively invest in production
    capacity, we did not reduce our total debt balance during the
    past two years, but remain committed to net debt reduction
    (total debt less cash) over the long term. We currently expect
    the total debt balance at year-end 2007 to be slightly higher
    than the 2006 year-end level.

We believe that we will be able to meet our interest and
    principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants
    for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational
    needs, including the pursuit of selected growth opportunities,
    through our strong cash flow, our program of issuing short-term
    debt, and maintaining credit facilities on a global basis. Our
    significant long-term debt issues do not



contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on
    credit ratings. A change in the Company’s credit ratings
    could limit its access to the U.S. short-term debt market

and/or

increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future.
    However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to
    have access to our credit facilities, which are in amounts
    sufficient to cover our outstanding commercial paper balance,
    which was $1.3 billion at December 30, 2006. In
    addition, assuming continuation of market liquidity, we believe
    it would be possible to term out certain short-term maturities
    or obtain additional credit facilities such that the Company
    could further extend its ability to meet its long-term borrowing
    obligations through 2008.

Off-balance
    Sheet Arrangements and  Other Obligations

Off-balance
    sheet arrangements

Our off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to a
    residual value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately
    $13 million, which will expire in July 2007, and guarantees
    on loans to independent contractors for their purchase of DSD
    route franchises up to $17 million. We record the estimated
    fair value of these loan guarantees on our balance sheet, which
    was insignificant for the periods presented. Refer to
    Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further information.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and

Significant Accounting
    Estimates

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1
    within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2006,
    we adopted two new accounting pronouncements which had a
    significant impact on our Company’s financial statements.
    At the beginning of 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R)
    “Share-Based Payment,” which materially reduced our
    fiscal 2006 results, due primarily to the first-time recognition
    of compensation expense associated with employee and director
    stock option grants. This topic is further discussed in the
    section beginning on page 21.

Secondly, at the end of 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans,” which required us to reflect
    the net over- or under-funded position of our defined
    postretirement and postemployment benefit plans as an asset or
    liability on the balance sheet, with unrecognized prior service
    cost and net experience losses recorded in shareholders’
    equity. Under pre-existing guidance, these unrecognized amounts,
    which totaled approximately $890.8 million at
    December 30, 2006, were disclosed only in financial
    statement footnotes. Accordingly, the after-tax presentation of
    these amounts on the balance sheet reduced consolidated net
    assets and shareholders’ equity by $591.9 million at
    year-end 2006. Nevertheless, we do not believe this impact is
    economically significant because our net earnings, cash flow,
    liquidity, debt covenants, and plan funding requirements were
    not affected by this change in accounting principle. Refer to
    Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further information on SFAS No. 158. Refer to the
    section beginning on page 22 for information on our process
    for estimating benefit obligations.

At the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year, we adopted FASB
    Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income



Taxes” (FIN No. 48), which affects our process
    for estimating tax benefits and liabilities, as further
    discussed in the “

Income taxes

” section
    beginning on page 24. The initial application of
    FIN No. 48 resulted in a net decrease to accrued
    income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately
    $2 million, with an offsetting increase to retained
    earnings. Refer to Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information on
    FIN No. 48.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements” to provide enhanced guidance
    for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The
    standard also expands disclosure requirements for assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value, how fair value is
    determined, and the effect of fair value measurements on
    earnings. The standard applies whenever other authoritative
    literature requires (or permits) certain assets or liabilities
    to be measured at fair value, but does not expand the use of
    fair value. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those years.
    Early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt
    SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of our 2008 fiscal
    year. For the Company, balance sheet items carried at fair value
    consist primarily of derivatives and other financial
    instruments, assets held for sale, exit liabilities, and the
    trust asset component of net benefit plan obligations. Relevant
    to the “

Intangibles

” section beginning on this
    page, we also use fair value concepts to test various long-lived
    assets for impairment and to initially measure assets and
    liabilities acquired in a business combination. We are currently
    evaluating the impact of adoption on how these assets and
    liabilities are currently measured.

Our critical accounting estimates, which require significant
    judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on
    our financial statements, are discussed in the following
    sections on pages 20-25.

Promotional
    expenditures

Our promotional activities are conducted either through the
    retail trade or directly with consumers and involve in-store
    displays and events; feature price discounts on our products;
    consumer coupons, contests, and loyalty programs; and similar
    activities. The costs of these activities are generally
    recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which
    normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition
    of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding
    the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either
    the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using
    various techniques including historical data on performance of
    similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated
    expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and
    recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent
    period. On a full-year basis, these subsequent period
    adjustments have rarely represented in excess of .4% (.004) of
    our Company’s net sales. However, as our Company’s
    total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as
    a revenue reduction) represented nearly 30% of 2006 net
    sales, the likelihood exists of materially different reported
    results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Intangibles

We follow SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” in evaluating impairment of intangibles.
    We perform this evaluation at least annually during the fourth
    quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting
    process. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment
    testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value
    and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill.
    Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated
    with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires
    allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units.
    The fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our
    assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a
    theoretical sale transaction. Similarly, impairment testing of
    other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value
    to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of
    non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on
    projections of future cash flows to be generated from that
    asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular
    trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream
    attributable to branded product sales. These estimates are made
    using various inputs including historical data, current and
    anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market
    comparables. We periodically engage third-party valuation
    consultants to assist in this process.

We also follow SFAS No. 142 in evaluating the useful
    life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset is expected to
    contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the
    Company. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is
    amortized; an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is
    not amortized, but is evaluated annually for impairment.
    Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant
    judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of
    obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such
    as the stability of the industry, known technological advances,
    legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing
    regulatory environment, and expected changes in



distribution channels), the level of required maintenance
    expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of
    assets.

At December 30, 2006, intangible assets, net, were
    $4.9 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and
    trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods
    Company. Within this total, approximately $1.4 billion of
    non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as
    indefinite-lived, comprised principally of Keebler trademarks.
    While we currently believe that the fair value of all of our
    intangibles exceeds carrying value and that those intangibles so
    classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the
    Company, materially different assumptions regarding future
    performance of our North American snacks business or the
    weighted-average cost of capital used in the valuations could
    result in significant impairment losses

and/or

amortization expense.

Stock
    compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R)
    “Share-Based Payment,” which generally requires public
    companies to measure the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
    grant-date fair value and to recognize this cost over the
    requisite service period. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R)
    as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, using the modified
    prospective method. Accordingly, prior years were not restated,
    but our 2006 results include compensation expense associated
    with unvested equity-based awards, which were granted prior to
    2006. With the adoption of this pronouncement, stock-based
    compensation represents a critical accounting policy of the
    Company, which is further described in Note 1 within Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For 2006, our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) has resulted
    in an increase in the Company’s corporate SGA expense and a
    corresponding reduction to earnings and net earnings per share,
    due primarily to recognition of compensation expense associated
    with employee and director stock option grants. No such expense
    was recognized under our previous accounting method in pre-2006
    periods; however, we were required to disclose pro forma results
    under the alternate fair value method prescribed by
    SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation.” Using reported results for 2006 and pro
    forma results for 2005, the comparable impact of stock
    compensation expense is presented in the following table:

As illustrated in the preceding table, the pro forma incremental
    impact of stock compensation was $.09 per share for 2005
    versus an $.11 impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) in
    2006. The

$.02 year-over-year

increase in the per-share impact is due principally to an
    increase in the number of options granted during 2006 and a
    lower average number of shares outstanding on which the
    calculation is based. As explained in the following paragraphs,
    the amount of stock compensation recognized for any particular
    year is highly dependent on market conditions and other factors
    outside of our control. Based on historical patterns and
    predicted market conditions existing at December 30, 2006,
    we currently expect the 2007 earnings per share impact of stock
    option expense to be within the range of actual 2005 and 2006
    results.

Accounting for stock compensation under
    SFAS No. 123(R) represents a critical accounting
    estimate, which requires significant judgments and assumptions
    likely to have a material impact on our financial statements.
    Due to the need to determine the grant-date fair value of equity
    instruments that have not yet been awarded, the actual impact on
    future results will depend, in part, on actual awards during any
    reporting period and various market factors that affect the fair
    value of those awards. Additionally, while the timing and volume
    of grants associated with a particular year’s long-term
    incentive compensation are within our control, the timing and
    volume of “reload” option grants are not. Reload
    options are awarded to eligible employees and directors to
    replace previously-owned Company stock used by those individuals
    to pay the exercise price, including related employment taxes,
    of vested pre-2004 option awards containing this accelerated
    ownership feature. Under SFAS No. 123(R), these reload
    options result in additional compensation expense in the year of
    grant and for 2006, represented approximately one-third of the
    Company’s total stock option expense. The



Company has not granted options containing an accelerated
    ownership feature since 2003; however, the potential requirement
    to award reload options over the contractual

10-year

term
    of the original grants could continue to significantly impact
    the amount of our stock-based compensation expense for a number
    of years.

We estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the
    date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model for
    annual grants and a Black-Scholes model for reload grants. These
    models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding
    future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and
    dividend yield. Our methods for selecting these valuation
    assumptions are explained in Note 8 within Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. In particular, our estimate
    of stock price volatility is based principally on historical
    volatility of the options granted, and to a lesser extent, on
    implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s
    stock. For the lattice-based model, historical volatility
    corresponds to the

10-year

contractual term of the options granted; whereas, for the
    Black-Scholes model, historical volatility corresponds to the
    expected term, which is currently 2.5 years. We decided to
    rely more heavily on historical volatility due to the greater
    availability of data and reliability of trends over longer
    periods of time, as compared to the terms of more thinly-traded
    options, which rarely extend beyond two years. At year-end 2006,
    historical volatilities using weekly price observations ranged
    from approximately 23% for 10 years to 12% for
    2.5 years. In comparison, implied volatilities averaged
    approximately 16% for traded options with terms in excess of six
    months. Based on this data, our weighted-average composite
    volatility assumption for purposes of valuing our option grants
    during 2006 was 17.9%, as compared to 22.0% for 2005. All other
    assumptions held constant, a one percentage point increase or
    decrease in our 2006 volatility assumption would increase or
    decrease the grant-date fair value of our 2006 option awards by
    approximately 4%.

To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions,
    we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based
    expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences
    can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon
    exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two
    paragraphs. Furthermore, as historical data has a significant
    bearing on our forward-looking assumptions, significant
    variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to
    prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then
    significantly impact the

year-over-year

comparability of stock-based compensation expense.

SFAS No. 123(R) also provides that any corporate
    income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award
    in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to
    as a “windfall tax benefit”) will be presented in the
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as a financing (rather than
    an operating) cash flow. If this standard had been adopted in
    2005, operating cash flow would have been lower (and financing
    cash flow would have been higher) by approximately
    $20 million as a result of this provision. For 2006, the
    corresponding reduction in operating cash flow attributable to
    windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow was
    $21.5 million. The actual impact on future years’
    operating cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of
    employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the
    relationship between the exercise-date market value of the
    underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value
    previously determined for financial reporting purposes.

For balance sheet classification purposes, realized windfall tax
    benefits are credited to capital in excess of par value within
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits
    (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in
    earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of
    windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to
    income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our
    consolidated effective income tax rate. Under the transition
    rules for adopting SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified
    prospective method, we were permitted to calculate a cumulative
    memo balance of windfall tax benefits from post-1995 years
    for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits.
    We completed such study prior to the first period of adoption
    and currently have sufficient cumulative memo windfall tax
    benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that 2007
    earnings are not currently expected to be affected by this
    provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior
    is not within our control, the likelihood exists of materially
    different reported results if different assumptions or
    conditions were to prevail.

Retirement
    benefits

Our Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined
    benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health
    care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada.
    Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations. A
    substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally
    diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings
    of debt securities and other investments. We follow
    SFAS No. 87 “Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions” and SFAS No. 106 “Employers’
    Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions”
    (as amended by SFAS No. 158, effective as of our
    fiscal year-end 2006) for the measurement and recognition
    of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans.
    Embodied in both of these standards is



the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement
    should be recognized over the employees’ active working
    life. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various
    actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and
    obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major
    actuarial assumptions that require significant management
    judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our
    consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include
    the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care
    cost trend rates, and the interest rates used to discount the
    obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the
    United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.

To conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on
    plan assets, we work with third-party financial consultants to
    model expected returns over a

20-year

investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix
    of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect
    a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and
    forward-looking views of the financial markets including
    consideration of current yields on long-term bonds,
    price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and
    long-term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to
    approximately 70% of our trust assets globally, currently
    incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.8% and an
    active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by
    historical analysis. Although we review our expected long-term
    rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment
    performance for one particular year does not, by itself,
    significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of
    return are generally not revised, provided these rates continue
    to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of
    between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected
    long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our
    assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2006 of 8.9%
    equated to approximately the 50th percentile expectation of
    our 2006 model. Similar methods are used for various foreign
    plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic
    conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately
    30% of our global benefit plan assets.

Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at December 30,
    2006, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return
    would increase 2007 benefits expense by approximately
    $42 million. Correspondingly, a 100 basis point
    shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan
    assets for 2007 would result in a similar amount of arising
    experience loss. Any arising asset-related experience gain or
    loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a
    five-year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses
    are amortized using a declining-balance method over the average
    remaining service period of active plan participants, which for
    U.S. plans is presently about 13 years. Under this
    recognition method, a 100 basis point shortfall in actual
    versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2007
    would reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $1 million
    in 2008, increasing to approximately $7 million in 2012.
    For each of the three years ending December 30, 2006, our
    actual return on plan assets exceeded the recognized assumed
    return by the following amounts (in millions):
    2006−$257.1; 2005−$39.4; 2004−$95.6.

To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we
    work with third-party financial consultants to model our actual
    claims cost data over a five-year historical period, including
    an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other
    important demographic components of our covered retiree
    population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of
    plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the
    underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost
    trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to
    remain consistent with recent historical experience and our
    expectations regarding short-term future trends. In comparison
    to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost growth rate
    of approximately 8%, our initial trend rate for 2007 of 9.5%
    reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing claims
    experience for certain demographic groups within our total
    employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by
    1% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.75% is
    reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as
    necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate
    of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost
    premium. Based on consolidated obligations at December 30,
    2006, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care
    cost trend rates would increase 2007 benefits expense by
    approximately $18 million. A 100 basis point excess of
    2007 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from
    the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience
    loss of approximately $9 million. Any arising health care
    claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the
    calculated amount of claims experience over a

four-year

period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are
    amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years,
    resulting in at least the minimum amortization prescribed by
    SFAS No. 106. The net experience gain arising from
    recognition of 2006 claims experience was approximately
    $6 million.



To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we use several
    published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to
    assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities, with a
    primary focus on the

Citigroup Pension Liability
    Index

®

for our U.S. plans. To test the appropriateness of
    these indices, we periodically engage third-party financial
    consultants to conduct a matching exercise between the expected
    settlement cash flows of our plans and bond maturities,
    consisting principally of AA-rated (or the equivalent in foreign
    jurisdictions) non-callable issues with at least
    $25 million principal outstanding. The model does not
    assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments
    mature just in time to pay benefits as they become due. For
    those years where no suitable bonds are available, the portfolio
    utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a
    hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required
    in those years. As of four different interim dates during 2005
    and 2006, this matching exercise for our U.S. plans
    produced a discount rate within +/− 15 basis
    points of the equivalent-dated

Citigroup Pension Liability
    Index

®

.

The measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are
    consistent with our Company’s fiscal year end. Thus, we
    select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that
    are consistent with market indices during December of each year.
    Based on consolidated obligations at December 30, 2006, a
    25 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount rate
    used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2007
    benefits expense by approximately $17 million. All
    obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized
    using a straight-line method over the average remaining service
    period of active plan participants.

Despite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting
    major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material
    differences between assumed and actual experience. As of
    December 30, 2006, we had consolidated unamortized prior
    service cost and net experience losses of approximately
    $.9 billion, as compared to approximately $1.4 billion
    at December 31, 2005. The

year-over-year

decline in net unamortized amounts was attributable largely to
    trust asset performance and the favorable impact of rising
    interest rates on our benefit obligations. Of the total
    unamortized amounts at December 30, 2006, approximately 80%
    was related to discount rate reductions, with the remainder
    primarily related to net unfavorable health care claims cost
    experience (including upward revisions in the assumed trend
    rate.) For 2007, we currently expect total amortization of prior
    service cost and net experience losses to be approximately
    $25 million lower than the actual 2006 amount of
    approximately $123 million. As discussed on page 14,
    total employee benefits expense for 2007 is expected to be
    approximately even with the 2006 amount, with higher active
    health care claims cost and postretirement service and interest
    cost components offsetting the lower amortization expense.

Assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current
    assumptions, annual amortization of accumulated prior service
    cost and net experience losses during each of the next several
    years would remain approximately level with the 2007 amount.

Income
    taxes

Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax
    planning opportunities available to us in the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is
    required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating
    our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our
    belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe
    that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we
    may not succeed. We adjust these reserves in light of changing
    facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.
    Our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve
    provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate.
    For the periods presented, our income tax and related interest
    reserves have averaged approximately $150 million. Reserve
    adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1% of
    earnings before income taxes annually. Nevertheless, the
    accumulation of individually insignificant discrete adjustments
    throughout a particular year has historically impacted our
    consolidated effective income tax rate by up to 200 basis
    points. As discussed on page 16, for 2007, we believe our
    rate could be up to 200 basis points lower if pending
    uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be
    affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more favorably
    than we currently expect.

For the periods presented, our policy was to establish reserves
    that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.
    Favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our
    effective tax rate in the period of resolution. As compared to a
    contingency approach, FIN No. 48 (which we adopted at
    the beginning of 2007) is



based on a benefit recognition model, which we believe could
    result in a greater amount of benefit (and a lower amount of
    reserve) being initially recognized in certain circumstances.
    Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of
    being sustained, FIN No. 48 permits a company to
    recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon
    settlement. The tax position must be derecognized when it is no
    longer more likely than not of being sustained. Despite this
    difference in conceptual approach, we do not currently expect
    the adoption of FIN No. 48 to have a significant
    impact on the amount of benefits recognized in connection with
    our uncertain tax positions during 2007. The current portion of
    our tax reserves is presented in the balance sheet within
    accrued income taxes and the amount expected to be settled after
    one year is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities.
    Significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax
    rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation
    table of Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Future
    Outlook

Our 2007 forecasted consolidated results are generally based on
    our long-term annual growth targets as discussed on
    page 11, although we currently expect our internal net
    sales could increase as much as four percent, slightly exceeding
    our low single-digit growth target. We expect this

higher-than-targeted

growth to come principally from continued category expansion in
    Latin America and strong innovation performance in North
    America. Despite a projected decline in gross margin of up to
    50 basis points, we believe the

higher-than-targeted

sales growth will support mid single-digit consolidated
    operating profit growth. As discussed on page 15, net
    interest expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately even
    with 2006 results and our consolidated effective income tax rate
    could be lower than the 2006 rate of approximately 32%. These
    two factors are expected to provide leverage for purposes of
    achieving our target of high single-digit growth in
    2007 net earnings per share. In addition, we remain
    committed to reinvesting in brand building, cost-reduction
    initiatives, and other growth opportunities. Lastly, we expect
    our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently
    targeting a level of $950-$1,025 million for 2007.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures  About Market Risk

Our Company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a
    part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative
    financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to
    manage these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not engage in
    trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 12
    within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information on our accounting policies related to derivative
    financial and commodity instruments.

Foreign
    exchange risk

Our Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash
    flows related to third-party purchases, intercompany loans and
    product shipments, and nonfunctional currency denominated
    third-party debt. Our Company is also exposed to fluctuations in
    the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and
    cash flows related to repatriation of these investments.
    Additionally, our Company is exposed to volatility in the
    translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. Dollars.
    Primary exposures include the U.S. Dollar versus the
    British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, and
    Mexican Peso, and in the case of inter-subsidiary transactions,
    the British Pound versus the Euro. We assess foreign currency
    risk based on transactional cash flows and translational
    volatility and enter into forward contracts, options, and
    currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short
    currency positions. Forward contracts and options are generally
    less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements are
    established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt
    issuances.

The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative
    instruments at year-end 2006 was $455 million, representing
    a settlement obligation of $1 million. The total notional
    amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year-end
    2005 was $467 million, representing a settlement obligation
    of $22 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of
    anticipated transactions, translational exposure, or existing
    assets or liabilities, and mature within 18 months.
    Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year-end exchange rates,
    the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately
    $46 million at year-end 2006 and $47 million at
    year-end 2005. These unfavorable changes would generally have
    been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying
    exposures.



Interest rate
    risk

Our Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard
    to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future
    issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposures include
    movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered
    Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. We periodically use
    interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to
    reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated
    with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of
    variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected
    market conditions.

Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    provides information on our significant debt issues. There were
    no interest rate derivatives outstanding at year-end 2006 and
    2005. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the
    year, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would
    have increased interest expense by approximately
    $20 million in 2006 and $9 million in 2005.

Price
    risk

Our Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a
    result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials,
    fuel, and energy. Primary exposures include corn, wheat, soybean
    oil, sugar, cocoa, paperboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We
    have historically used the combination of long-term contracts
    with suppliers, and

exchange-traded futures and option contracts to reduce price
    fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material
    purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months.
    During 2006, we entered into two separate

10-year

over-the-counter

commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price
    of natural gas used principally in its manufacturing processes.
    The notional amount of the swaps totaled approximately
    $209 million, which currently equates to approximately 50%
    of our North America manufacturing needs.

The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at
    year-end 2006, including the natural gas swaps, was
    $239 million, representing a settlement obligation of
    approximately $11 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in
    year-end commodity prices, the settlement obligation would
    increase by approximately $17 million, generally offset by
    a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
    The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at
    year-end 2005 was $22 million, representing a settlement
    receivable of approximately $1 million. Assuming a 10%
    decrease in year-end commodity prices, this settlement
    receivable would convert to an obligation of approximately
    $1 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of
    the underlying material purchases.

In addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed
    above, we use long-term contracts with suppliers to manage a
    portion of the price exposure. It should be noted that the
    exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a
    limitation in assessing the net market risk of our Company.

Note 1 Accounting
    policies

Basis of
    presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Kellogg Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
    Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

The Company’s fiscal year normally ends on the Saturday
    closest to December 31 and as a result, a 53rd week is
    added approximately every sixth year. The Company’s 2006
    and 2005 fiscal years ended on December 30 and
    December 31, respectively. The Company’s 2004 fiscal
    year ended on January 1, 2005, and included a
    53rd week.

Cash and cash
    equivalents

Highly liquid temporary investments with original maturities of
    less than three months are considered to be cash equivalents.
    The carrying amount approximates fair value.

Accounts
    receivable

Accounts receivable consist principally of trade receivables,
    which are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowances for
    doubtful accounts and prompt payment discounts. Trade
    receivables generally do not bear interest. Terms and collection
    patterns vary around the world and by channel. In the United
    States, the Company generally has required payment for goods
    sold eleven or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as
    2% 10/net 11 or 1% 15/net 16, and days sales outstanding
    (DSO) has averaged approximately 19 days during the periods
    presented. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents
    management’s estimate of the amount of probable credit
    losses in existing accounts receivable, as determined from a
    review of past due balances and other specific account data.
    Account balances are written off against the allowance when
    management determines the receivable is uncollectible. The
    Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure
    related to its customers. Refer to Note 15 for an analysis
    of the Company’s accounts receivable and allowance for
    doubtful account balances during the periods presented.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (principally
    average) or market.

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)
    No. 151 “Inventory Costs” to converge
    U.S. GAAP principles with International Accounting
    Standards on inventory valuation. SFAS No. 151
    clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
    freight, handling costs, and spoilage should be recognized as
    period charges, rather than as inventory value. This standard
    also provides that fixed production overheads should be
    allocated to units of production based on the normal capacity of
    production facilities, with excess overheads being recognized as
    period charges. The provisions of this standard are effective
    for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
    June 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted. The
    Company adopted this standard at the beginning of its 2006
    fiscal year. The Company’s pre-existing accounting policy
    for inventory valuation was generally consistent with this
    guidance. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 151
    did not have a significant impact on the Company’s 2006
    financial results.

Property

The Company’s property consists mainly of plant and
    equipment used for manufacturing activities. These assets are
    recorded at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives
    using straight-line methods for financial reporting and
    accelerated methods, where permitted, for tax reporting. Major
    property categories are depreciated over various periods as
    follows (in years): manufacturing machinery and equipment 5-20;
    computer and other office equipment 3-5; building components

15-30;

building structures 50. Cost includes an amount of interest
    associated with significant capital projects. Plant and
    equipment are reviewed for impairment when conditions indicate
    that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions
    include an extended period of idleness or a plan of disposal.
    Assets to be abandoned at a future date are depreciated over the
    remaining period of use. Assets to be sold are written down to
    realizable value at the time the assets are being actively
    marketed for sale and the disposal is expected to occur within
    one year. As of year-end 2005 and 2006, the carrying value of
    assets held for sale was insignificant.

Goodwill and
    other intangible assets

The Company’s intangible assets consist primarily of
    goodwill and major trademarks arising from the 2001 acquisition
    of Keebler Foods Company (“Keebler”). Management
    expects the Keebler trademarks, collectively, to contribute
    indefinitely to the cash flows of the Company. Accordingly, this
    asset has been classified as an “indefinite-lived”
    intangible pursuant to SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets.” Under



this standard, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not
    amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment.
    Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between
    the carrying value and fair value of a “reporting
    unit,” which for the Company is generally equivalent to a
    North American product group or International country market. If
    carrying value exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered
    impaired and is reduced to the implied fair value. Impairment
    testing for

non-amortized

intangibles requires a comparison between the fair value and
    carrying value of the intangible asset. If carrying value
    exceeds fair value, the intangible is considered impaired and is
    reduced to fair value. The Company uses various market valuation
    techniques to determine the fair value of intangible assets and
    periodically engages third-party valuation consultants for this
    purpose. Refer to Note 2 for further information on
    goodwill and other intangible assets.

Revenue
    recognition and measurement

The Company recognizes sales upon delivery of its products to
    customers net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns,
    allowances, and various government withholding taxes.
    Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on
    local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range
    from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to
    reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where
    applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a
    combination of historical patterns and future expectations
    regarding specific in-market product performance. The Company
    classifies promotional payments to its customers, the cost of
    consumer coupons, and other cash redemption offers in net sales.
    The cost of promotional package inserts are recorded in cost of
    goods sold. Other types of consumer promotional expenditures are
    normally recorded in selling, general, and administrative (SGA)
    expense.

Advertising

The costs of advertising are generally expensed as incurred and
    are classified within SGA expense.

Research and
    development

The costs of research and development (R&D) are generally
    expensed as incurred and are classified within SGA expense.
    R&D includes expenditures for new product and process
    innovation, as well as significant technological improvements to
    existing products and processes. Total annual expenditures for
    R&D are disclosed in Note 15 and are principally
    comprised of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies
    attributable to time spent on R&D activities. Other costs
    include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and
    equipment, including assets at manufacturing locations that are
    temporarily engaged in pilot plant activities.

Stock
    compensation

The Company uses various equity-based compensation programs to
    provide long-term performance incentives for its global
    workforce. Refer to Note 8 for further information on these
    programs and the amount of compensation expense recognized
    during the periods presented.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R)
    “Share-Based Payment,” which generally requires public
    companies to measure the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
    grant-date fair value and to recognize this cost over the
    requisite service period. The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R) as of the beginning of its 2006 fiscal
    year, using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior
    years were not restated, but 2006 results include compensation
    expense associated with unvested equity-based awards, which were
    granted prior to 2006.

Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company used
    the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles
    Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees” to account for its employee stock
    options and other stock-based compensation. Under this method,
    because the exercise price of stock options granted to employees
    and directors equaled the market price of the underlying stock
    on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was
    recognized. Expense attributable to other types of stock-based
    awards was generally recognized in the Company’s reported
    results under APB No. 25.

Certain of the Company’s equity-based compensation plans
    contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon
    retirement, disability, or death of eligible employees and
    directors. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    Company generally recognized stock compensation expense over the
    stated vesting period of the award, with any unamortized expense
    recognized immediately if an acceleration event occurred.
    SFAS No. 123(R) specifies that a stock-based award is
    considered vested for expense attribution purposes when the
    employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent
    on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, beginning in 2006,
    the Company has prospectively revised its expense attribution
    method so that the related compensation cost is recognized
    immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible
    individuals or over the



period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is
    achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.

The Company classifies pre-tax stock compensation expense
    principally in SGA expense within its corporate operations.
    Expense attributable to awards of equity instruments is accrued
    in capital in excess of par value within the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

SFAS No. 123(R) also provides that any corporate
    income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award
    in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to
    as a “windfall tax benefit”) will be presented in the
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as a financing (rather than
    an operating) cash flow. Realized windfall tax benefits are
    credited to capital in excess of par value in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which
    are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first
    offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits,
    if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense. Under
    the transition rules for adopting SFAS No. 123(R)
    using the modified prospective method, the Company was permitted
    to calculate a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits
    from post-1995 years for the purpose of accounting for
    future shortfall tax benefits. The Company completed such study
    prior to the first period of adoption and currently has
    sufficient cumulative memo windfall tax benefits to absorb
    arising shortfalls, such that earnings were not affected in
    2006. Correspondingly, the Company includes the impact of pro
    forma deferred tax assets (i.e., the “as if” windfall
    or shortfall) for purposes of determining assumed proceeds in
    the treasury stock calculation of diluted earnings per share
    under SFAS No. 128 “Earnings Per Share.”

Employee
    postretirement and postemployment benefits

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign plans to
    provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to
    retired employees, as well as salary continuance, severance, and
    long-term disability to former or inactive employees. Refer to
    Notes 9 and 10 for further information on these benefits
    and the amount of expense recognized during the periods
    presented.

In order to improve the reporting of pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans in the financial statements, in
    September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans,” which is effective at the end
    of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. Prior
    periods are not restated. The standard generally requires
    company plan sponsors to measure the net over- or under-funded
    position of a defined postretirement benefit plan as of the
    sponsor’s fiscal year end and to display that position as
    an asset or liability on the balance sheet. Any unrecognized
    prior service cost, experience gains/losses, or transition
    obligation are reported as a component of other comprehensive
    income, net of tax, in shareholders’ equity. In contrast,
    under pre-existing guidance, these unrecognized amounts were
    generally disclosed only in financial statement footnotes, often
    resulting in a disparity between plan balance sheet positions
    and the funded status. Furthermore, plan measurement dates could
    occur up to three months prior to year end.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of the end of its
    2006 fiscal year. The Company had previously applied
    postretirement accounting concepts for purposes of recognizing
    its postemployment benefit obligations; accordingly, the
    adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 30, 2006,
    affected the balance sheet display of both the Company’s
    postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations, as

Recently
    issued pronouncements

Uncertain tax
    positions

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN No. 48) to clarify what criteria must be met
    prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit, in
    accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes,” of a position taken in a tax return. The
    provisions of the final interpretation apply broadly to all tax
    positions taken by an enterprise, including the decision not to
    report income in a tax return or the decision to classify a
    transaction as tax exempt. The prescribed approach is based on a
    two-step benefit recognition model. The first step is to
    evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
    weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than
    not, based on the technical merits and without consideration of
    detection risk, that the position will be sustained on audit,
    including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes,
    if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of
    the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is
    measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater
    than 50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon
    settlement. The tax position must be derecognized when it is no
    longer more likely than not of being sustained. The
    interpretation also provides guidance on recognition and
    classification of related penalties and interest, classification
    of liabilities, and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits.
    The change in net assets, if any, as a result of applying the
    provisions of this interpretation is considered a change in
    accounting principle with the cumulative effect of the change
    treated as an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of
    retained earnings in the period of transition. The final
    interpretation is effective for the first annual period
    beginning after December 15, 2006, with earlier application
    encouraged.

The Company adopted FIN No. 48 as of the beginning of
    its 2007 fiscal year. Prior to adoption, the Company’s
    pre-existing policy was to establish reserves for uncertain tax
    positions that reflected the probable outcome of known tax
    contingencies. As compared to the Company’s historical
    approach, the application of FIN No. 48 resulted in a
    net decrease to accrued income tax and related interest
    liabilities of approximately $2 million, with an offsetting
    increase to retained earnings.

Interest recognized in accordance with FIN No. 48 may
    be classified in the financial statements as either income taxes
    or interest expense, based on the accounting policy election of
    the enterprise. Similarly, penalties may be classified as income
    taxes or another expense. The Company has historically
    classified income tax-related interest and penalties as interest
    expense and SGA expense, respectively, and will continue to do
    so under FIN No. 48.

Fair
    value

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements” to provide enhanced guidance
    for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The
    standard also expands disclosure requirements for assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value, how fair value is
    determined, and the effect of fair value measurements on
    earnings. The standard applies whenever other authoritative
    literature requires (or permits) certain assets or liabilities
    to be measured at fair value, but does not expand the use of
    fair value. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those years.
    Early adoption is permitted. The Company plans to adopt
    SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of its 2008 fiscal
    year. For the Company, balance sheet items carried at fair value
    consist primarily of derivatives and other financial
    instruments, assets held for sale, exit liabilities, and the
    trust asset component of net benefit plan obligations.
    Additionally, the Company uses fair value concepts to test
    various long-lived assets for impairment and to initially
    measure assets and liabilities acquired in a business
    combination. Management is currently evaluating the impact of
    adoption on how these assets and liabilities are currently
    measured.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



Note 2

Acquisitions,
    other investments, and intangibles

Acquisitions

In order to support the continued growth of its North American
    fruit snacks business, the Company completed two separate
    business acquisitions during 2005 for a total of approximately
    $50 million in cash, including related transaction costs.
    In June 2005, the Company acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing
    facility and related assets from Kraft Foods Inc. The facility
    is located in Chicago, Illinois and employs approximately 400
    active hourly and salaried employees. In November 2005, the
    Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain
    liabilities of a Washington State-based manufacturer of natural
    and organic fruit snacks. Assets, liabilities, and results of
    the acquired businesses have been included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of
    acquisition. The combined purchase price for both transactions
    was allocated to property ($22 million); goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangibles ($16 million); and inventory
    and other working capital ($12 million).

Joint venture
    arrangement

In early 2006, a subsidiary of the Company formed a joint
    venture with a third-party company domiciled in Turkey, for the
    purpose of selling co-branded products in the surrounding
    region. As of December 30, 2006, the Company had
    contributed approximately $3.5 million in cash for a 50%
    equity interest in this arrangement. The Turkish joint venture
    is reflected in the consolidated financial statements on the
    equity basis of accounting. Accordingly, the Company records its
    share of the earnings or loss from this arrangement as well as
    other direct transactions with or on behalf of the joint venture
    entity such as product sales and certain administrative
    expenses. Summary financial information for one hundred percent

Note 3 Cost-reduction
    initiatives

The Company views its continued spending on cost-reduction
    initiatives as part of its ongoing operating principles to
    reinvest earnings so as to provide greater reliability in
    meeting long-term growth targets. Initiatives undertaken must
    meet certain pay-back and internal rate of return (IRR) targets.
    Each cost-reduction initiative is normally one to three years in
    duration. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed
    in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to
    deliver cash savings

and/or

reduced depreciation, which is then used to fund new
    initiatives. To implement these programs, the Company has
    incurred various up-front costs, including asset write-offs,
    exit charges, and other project expenditures.

Cost
    summary

For 2006, the Company recorded total program-related charges of
    approximately $82 million, comprised of $20 million of
    asset write-offs, $30 million for severance and other exit
    costs, $9 million for other cash expenditures,
    $4 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal
    liability, and $19 million for pension and other
    postretirement plan curtailment losses and special termination
    benefits. Approximately $74 million of the total 2006
    charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within operating
    segment results, with approximately $8 million recorded in
    selling, general, and administrative (SGA) expense within
    corporate results. The Company’s operating segments were
    impacted as follows (in millions): North America−$46;
    Europe−$28.

For 2005, the Company recorded total program-related charges of
    approximately $90 million, comprised of $16 million
    for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability,
    $44 million of asset write-offs, $21 million for
    severance and other exit costs, and $9 million for other
    cash expenditures. All of the 2005 charges were recorded in cost
    of goods sold within the Company’s North America operating
    segment.

For 2004, the Company recorded total program-related charges of
    approximately $109 million, comprised of $41 million
    in asset write-offs, $1 million for special pension
    termination benefits, $15 million in severance and other
    exit costs, and $52 million in other cash expenditures such
    as relocation and consulting. Approximately $46 million of
    the total 2004 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold, with
    approximately $63 million recorded in SGA expense. The 2004
    charges impacted the Company’s operating segments as
    follows (in millions): North America−$44; Europe−$65.

Exit cost reserves were approximately $14 million at
    December 30, 2006, consisting principally of severance
    obligations associated with projects commenced in 2006, which
    are expected to be paid out in 2007. At December 31, 2005,
    exit cost reserves were approximately $13 million,
    primarily representing severance costs that were substantially
    paid out in 2006.

Specific
    initiatives

In September 2006, the Company approved a multi-year European
    manufacturing optimization plan to improve utilization of its
    facility in Manchester, England and to better align production
    in Europe. Based on forecasted foreign exchange rates, the
    Company currently expects to incur approximately
    $60 million in total up-front costs (including those
    already incurred in 2006), comprised of approximately 80% cash
    and 20% non-cash asset write-offs, to complete this initiative.
    The cash portion of the total up-front costs results principally
    from management’s plan to eliminate approximately
    220 hourly and salaried positions from the Manchester
    facility by the end of 2008 through voluntary early retirement
    and severance programs. The pension trust funding requirements
    of these early retirements are expected to exceed the recognized
    benefit expense impact by approximately $10 million; most
    of this incremental funding occurred in 2006. During this
    period, certain manufacturing equipment will also be removed
    from service. For 2006, the Company incurred approximately
    $28 million of total up-front costs, including
    $9 million of pension plan curtailment losses and special
    termination benefits.

During 2006, the Company commenced several initiatives to
    enhance the productivity and efficiency of its U.S. cereal
    manufacturing network, primarily through technological and
    sourcing improvements in warehousing and packaging operations.
    In conjunction with these initiatives, the Company offered
    voluntary separation incentives, which resulted in the
    retirement of approximately 80 hourly employees by early
    2007. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company incurred
    approximately $15 million of total up-front costs,
    comprised of approximately 20% asset write-offs and 80% cash
    costs, including $10 million of pension and other
    postretirement plan curtailment losses.

Also during 2006, the Company undertook an initiative to improve
    customer focus and selling efficiency within a particular Latin
    American market, leading to a shift from a third-party
    distributor to a direct sales force model. As a result of this
    initiative, the Company paid $8 million in cash during



the fourth quarter of 2006 to exit the existing distribution
    arrangement.

To improve operational efficiency and better position its North
    American snacks business for future growth, during 2005, the
    Company undertook an initiative to consolidate U.S. bakery
    capacity, which was completed by the end of 2006. The project
    resulted in the closure and sale of the Company’s Des
    Plaines, Illinois facility in late 2005 and closure of its
    Macon, Georgia facility in April 2006, with sale occurring in
    September 2006. These closures resulted in the elimination of
    over 700 hourly and salaried employee positions, through
    the combination of involuntary severance and attrition. Related
    to this initiative, the Company incurred up-front costs of
    approximately $80 million in 2005, comprised of
    approximately one-half asset write-offs and one-half cash costs,
    including $16 million for the present value of a projected
    multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability associated with
    closure of the Macon facility. The Company incurred
    approximately $31 million in up-front costs for 2006,
    comprised of approximately one-third asset write-offs and
    two-thirds cash costs, including a $4 million increase in
    the Company’s estimated pension plan withdrawal liability
    to $20 million. This increase was principally attributable
    to investment loss experienced during 2005 in conjunction with
    increased benefit levels for all participating employers. The
    final calculation of this liability is pending full-year 2007
    employee hours attributable to the Company’s remaining
    participation in this plan, and is therefore subject to
    adjustment in early 2008. The associated cash obligation is
    payable to the pension fund over a

20-year

maximum period; management has not currently determined the
    actual period over which the payments will be made. Except for
    this pension plan withdrawal liability, the Company’s cash
    obligations attributable to this initiative were substantially
    paid out by year end 2006.

During 2004, the Company commenced an operational improvement
    initiative which resulted in the consolidation of veggie foods
    manufacturing at its Zanesville, Ohio facility and the closure
    and sale of its Worthington, Ohio facility by mid 2005. As a
    result of this closing, approximately 280 employee positions
    were eliminated through separation and attrition. Related to
    this initiative, the Company recognized approximately
    $20 million of up-front costs in 2004 and $10 million
    in 2005. For both years, the total amounts were comprised of
    approximately two-thirds asset write-offs and one-third cash
    costs such as severance and removal, which were entirely paid
    out by the end of 2005.

During 2004, the Company’s global rollout of its SAP
    information technology system resulted in accelerated
    depreciation of legacy software assets to be abandoned in 2005,
    as well as related consulting and other implementation expenses.
    Total incremental costs for 2004 were approximately
    $30 million. In close association with this SAP rollout,
    management undertook a major initiative to improve the
    organizational design and effectiveness of pan-European
    operations. Specific benefits of this initiative were expected
    to include improved marketing and promotional coordination
    across Europe, supply chain network savings, overhead cost
    reductions, and tax savings. To achieve these benefits,
    management implemented, at the beginning of 2005, a new European
    legal and operating structure headquartered in Ireland, with
    strengthened pan-European management authority and coordination.
    During 2004, the Company incurred various up-front costs,
    including relocation, severance, and consulting, of
    approximately $30 million. Additional relocation and other
    costs to complete this business transformation after 2004 have
    been insignificant.

In order to integrate it with the rest of our
    U.S. operations, during 2004, the Company completed the
    relocation of its U.S. snacks business unit from Elmhurst,
    Illinois (the former headquarters of Keebler Foods Company) to
    Battle Creek, Michigan. About one-third of the approximately 300
    employees affected by this initiative accepted relocation or
    reassignment offers. The recruiting effort to fill the remaining
    open positions was substantially completed by year-end 2004.
    Attributable to this initiative, the Company incurred
    approximately $15 million in relocation, recruiting, and
    severance costs during 2004. Subject to achieving certain
    employment levels and other regulatory requirements, management
    expects to defray a significant portion of these up-front costs
    through various multi-year tax incentives, which began in 2005.
    The Elmhurst office building was sold in late 2004, and the net
    sales proceeds approximated carrying value.

Note 4 Other
    income (expense), net

Other income (expense), net includes non-operating items such as
    interest income, charitable donations, and foreign exchange
    gains and losses. Net foreign exchange transaction losses for
    the periods presented were approximately (in millions):
    2006−$2; 2005−$2; 2004−$15.

Other expense includes charges for contributions to the
    Kellogg’s Corporate Citizenship Fund, a private trust
    established for charitable giving, as follows (in millions):
    2006−$3; 2005−$16; 2004−$9. Other expense for
    2005 also includes a charge of approximately $7 million to
    reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to
    estimated selling value. This facility was sold in August 2006.



Note 5 Equity

During the year ended December 30, 2006, the Company
    revised the classification of $101.4 million of prior net
    losses realized upon reissuance of treasury shares from capital
    in excess of par value to retained earnings on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. Such reissuances occurred in connection with
    employee and director stock option exercises and other
    share-based settlements. The revision did not have an effect on
    the Company’s results of operations, total
    shareholders’ equity, or cash flows.

Earnings per
    share

Basic net earnings per share is determined by dividing net
    earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share is
    similarly determined, except that the denominator is increased
    to include the number of additional common shares that would
    have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares
    had been issued. Dilutive potential common shares are comprised
    principally of employee stock options issued by the Company.
    Basic net earnings per share is reconciled to diluted net
    earnings per share in the following table. The total number of
    anti-dilutive potential common shares excluded from the
    reconciliation for each period was (in millions): 2006−.7;
    2005−1.5; 2004−4.3.

Stock
    transactions

The Company issues shares to employees and directors under
    various equity-based compensation and stock purchase programs,
    as further discussed in Note 8. The number of shares issued
    during the periods presented was (in millions): 2006−7.2;
    2005−7.7; 2004−10.7. Additionally, during 2006, the
    Company established

Kellogg
    Direct

tm

,

a direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan
    for U.S. shareholders and issued less than .1 million
    shares for that purpose in 2006.

To offset these issuances and for general corporate purposes,
    the Company’s Board of Directors has authorized management
    to repurchase specified amounts of the Company’s common
    stock in each of the periods presented. In 2006, the Company
    spent $650 million to repurchase approximately
    14.9 million shares. This activity consisted principally of
    a February 2006 private transaction with the W.K. Kellogg
    Foundation Trust to repurchase approximately 12.8 million
    shares for $550 million. In 2005, the Company spent
    $664 million to repurchase approximately 15.4 million
    shares. This activity consisted principally of a November 2005
    private transaction with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust
    to repurchase approximately 9.4 million shares for
    $400 million. In 2004, the Company spent $298 million
    to repurchase approximately 7.3 million shares.

On December 8, 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $650 million
    for 2007.

Comprehensive
    income

Comprehensive income includes net earnings and all other changes
    in equity during a period except those resulting from
    investments by or distributions to shareholders. Other
    comprehensive income for the periods presented consists of
    foreign currency translation adjustments pursuant to
    SFAS No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation,”
    unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges pursuant to
    SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and minimum pension
    liability adjustments pursuant to SFAS No. 87
    “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.”
    Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive income at
    December 30, 2006, reflects the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” as
    of the



Company’s 2006 fiscal year end. Refer to Note 1 for

Leases and
    other commitments

The Company’s leases are generally for equipment and
    warehouse space. Rent expense on all operating leases was (in
    millions): 2006–$122.8; 2005–$115.1; 2004–$107.4.
    Additionally, the Company is subject to a residual value
    guarantee on one operating lease of approximately
    $13 million which expires in July 2007. At
    December 30, 2006, the Company had not recorded any
    liability related to this residual value guarantee. During 2006
    and 2005, the Company entered into approximately $2 million
    and $3 million, respectively, in capital lease agreements
    to finance the purchase of equipment. Similar transactions in
    2004 were insignificant.

At December 30, 2006, future minimum annual lease
    commitments under noncancelable operating and capital leases
    were as follows:

One of the Company’s subsidiaries is guarantor on loans to
    independent contractors for the purchase of DSD route
    franchises. At year-end 2006, there were total loans outstanding
    of $16.0 million to 517 franchisees. All loans are variable
    rate with a term of 10 years. Related to this arrangement,
    the Company has established with a financial institution a
    one-year renewable loan facility up to $17.0 million with a
    five-year term-out and servicing arrangement. The Company has
    the right to revoke and resell the route franchises in the event
    of default or any other breach of contract by franchisees.
    Revocations are infrequent. The Company’s maximum potential
    future payments under these guarantees are limited to the
    outstanding loan principal balance plus unpaid interest. The
    estimated fair value of these guarantees is recorded in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet and was insignificant for the periods
    presented.

The Company has provided various standard indemnifications in
    agreements to sell business assets and lease facilities over the
    past several years, related primarily to pre-existing tax,
    environmental, and employee benefit obligations. Certain of
    these indemnifications are limited by agreement in either amount

and/or

term
    and others are unlimited. The Company has also provided various
    “hold harmless” provisions within certain service type
    agreements. Because



the Company is not currently aware of any actual exposures
    associated with these indemnifications, management is unable to
    estimate the maximum potential future payments to be made. At
    December 30, 2006, the Company had not recorded any
    liability related to these indemnifications.

that it had exercised its right to call for early redemption all
    of the outstanding Euro Notes effective February 28, 2007,
    at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus
    accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.

At December 30, 2006, the Company had $2.2 billion of
    short-term lines of credit, virtually all of which were unused
    and available for borrowing on an unsecured basis. These lines
    were comprised principally of an unsecured Five-Year Credit
    Agreement, which the Company entered into during November 2006
    to replace an existing facility, which would have expired in
    2009. The agreement allows the Company to borrow, on a revolving
    credit basis, up to $2.0 billion, to obtain letters of
    credit in an aggregate amount up to $75 million, and to
    provide a procedure for lenders to bid on short-term debt of the
    Company. The agreement contains customary covenants and
    warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness,
    liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and a specified interest
    coverage ratio. If an event of default occurs, then, to the
    extent permitted, the administrative agent may terminate the
    commitments under the credit facility, accelerate any
    outstanding loans, and demand the deposit of cash collateral
    equal to the lender’s letter of credit exposure plus
    interest. The facility is available for general corporate
    purposes, including commercial paper

back-up,

although the Company does not currently anticipate any usage
    under the facility.

Scheduled principal repayments on long-term debt are (in
    millions): 2007−$723.3; 2008−$466.1;
    2009−$1.2; 2010−$1.1; 2011−$1,500.5; 2012 and
    beyond−$1,100.2.

Interest paid was (in millions): 2006−$299;
    2005−$295; 2004−$333. Interest expense capitalized
    as part of the construction cost of fixed assets was (in
    millions): 2006−$2.7; 2005−$1.2; 2004−$.9.

Subsequent
    events

As discussed in preceding subnote (d), on January 31, 2007,
    a subsidiary of the Company announced an early redemption,
    effective February 28, 2007, of Euro 550 million of
    Guaranteed Floating Rate Notes otherwise due May 2007. To
    partially refinance this redemption, the Company and two of its
    subsidiaries (the “Issuers”) established a program
    under which the Issuers may issue euro-commercial paper notes up
    to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of
    $750 million or its equivalent in alternative currencies.
    The notes may have maturities ranging up to 364 days and
    will be senior unsecured obligations of the applicable Issuer.
    Notes issued by subsidiary Issuers will be guaranteed by the
    Company. The notes may be issued at a discount or may bear fixed
    or floating rate interest or a coupon calculated by reference to
    an index or formula.

In connection with these financing activities, the Company
    increased its short-term lines of credit from $2.2 billion
    at December 30, 2006 to approximately $2.6 billion,
    via a $400 million unsecured

364-Day

Credit Agreement effective January 31, 2007. The

364-Day

Agreement contains customary covenants, warranties, and
    restrictions similar to those described herein for the Five-Year
    Credit Agreement. The facility is available for general
    corporate purposes, including commercial paper

back-up,

although the Company does not currently anticipate any usage
    under the facility.

Note 8 Stock
    compensation

The Company uses various equity-based compensation programs to
    provide long-term performance incentives for its global
    workforce. Currently, these incentives consist principally of
    stock options, and to a lesser extent, executive performance
    shares and restricted stock grants. The Company also sponsors a
    discounted stock purchase plan in the United States and
    matching-grant programs in several international locations.
    Additionally, the Company awards stock options and restricted
    stock to its outside directors. These awards are administered
    through several plans, as described within this Note.

The 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2003 Plan”),
    approved by shareholders in 2003, permits benefits to be awarded
    to employees and officers in the form of incentive and
    non-qualified stock options, performance units, restricted stock
    or restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. The
    2003 Plan authorizes the issuance of a total of
    (a) 25 million shares plus (b) shares not issued
    under the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan, with no more than
    5 million shares to be issued in satisfaction of
    performance units, performance-based restricted shares and other
    awards (excluding stock options and stock appreciation rights),
    and with additional annual limitations on awards or payments to
    individual participants. At December 30, 2006, there were
    15.0 million remaining authorized, but unissued, shares
    under the 2003 Plan. During the periods presented, specific
    awards and terms of those awards granted under the 2003 Plan are
    described in the following sections of this Note.

The Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (“Director Plan”)
    was approved by shareholders in 2000 and allows each eligible
    non-employee director to receive 1,700 shares of the
    Company’s common stock annually and annual grants of
    options to purchase 5,000 shares of the Company’s
    common stock. At December 30, 2006, there were



.4 million remaining authorized, but unissued, shares under
    this plan. Shares other than options are placed in the Kellogg
    Company Grantor Trust for Non-Employee Directors (the
    “Grantor Trust”). Under the terms of the Grantor
    Trust, shares are available to a director only upon termination
    of service on the Board. Under this plan, awards were as
    follows: 2006−50,000 options and 17,000 shares;
    2005−55,000 options and 17,000 shares;
    2004−55,000 options and 18,700 shares. Options
    granted to directors under this plan are included in the option
    activity tables within this Note.

The 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was approved by
    shareholders in 2002 and permits eligible employees to purchase
    Company stock at a discounted price. This plan allows for a
    maximum of 2.5 million shares of Company stock to be issued
    at a purchase price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair
    market value of the stock on the first or last day of the
    quarterly purchase period. Total purchases through this plan for
    any employee are limited to a fair market value of $25,000
    during any calendar year. At December 30, 2006, there were
    1.5 million remaining authorized, but unissued, shares
    under this plan. Shares were purchased by employees under this
    plan as follows (approximate number of shares):
    2006−237,000; 2005−218,000; 2004−214,000.
    Options granted to employees to repurchase discounted stock
    under this plan are included in the option activity tables
    within this Note.

Additionally, during 2002, a foreign subsidiary of the Company
    established a stock purchase plan for its employees. Subject to
    limitations, employee contributions to this plan are matched 1:1
    by the Company. Under this plan, shares were granted by the
    Company to match an approximately equal number of shares
    purchased by employees as follows (approximate number of
    shares): 2006−80,000; 2005−80,000; 2004−82,000.

The Executive Stock Purchase Plan was established in 2002 to
    encourage and enable certain eligible employees of the Company
    to acquire Company stock, and to align more closely the
    interests of those individuals and the Company’s
    shareholders. This plan allows for a maximum of
    500,000 shares of Company stock to be issued. At
    December 30, 2006, there were .5 million remaining
    authorized, but unissued, shares under this plan. Under this
    plan, shares were granted by the Company to executives in lieu
    of cash bonuses as follows (approximate number of shares):
    2006−4,000; 2005−2,000; 2004−8,000.

For 2006, the Company used the fair value method prescribed by
    SFAS No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment” to
    account for its equity-based compensation programs. Prior to
    2006, the Company used the intrinsic value method prescribed by
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Refer to
    Note 1 for further information on the Company’s
    accounting policy for stock compensation.

For the year ended December 30, 2006, compensation expense
    for all types of equity-based programs and the related income
    tax benefit recognized was $95.7 million and
    $34.0 million, respectively. As a result of adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006, the Company’s reported
    pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the year was
    $65.4 million higher (with net earnings and net earnings
    per share (basic and diluted) correspondingly lower by
    $42.4 million and $.11, respectively) than if it had
    continued to account for its equity-based programs under APB
    No. 25. Amounts for the prior years are presented in the
    following table in accordance with SFAS No. 123
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and related
    interpretations. Reported amounts consist principally of expense
    recognized for executive performance share and restricted stock
    awards; pro forma amounts are attributable primarily to stock
    option grants.

As of December 30, 2006, total stock-based compensation
    cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was
    approximately $36 million and the weighted-average period
    over which this amount is expected to be recognized was
    approximately 1.4 years.

Cash flows realized upon exercise or vesting of stock-based
    awards in the periods presented are included in the following
    table. Within this table, the 2006 windfall tax benefit (amount
    realized in excess of that previously recognized in earnings) of
    $21.5 million represents the operating cash flow reduction
    (and financing cash flow increase) related to the Company’s
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006. (Refer to
    Note 1 for further information on the Company’s
    accounting policies



regarding tax benefit windfalls and shortfalls.) Cash used by
    the Company to settle equity instruments granted under
    stock-based awards was insignificant.

Shares used to satisfy stock-based awards are normally issued
    out of treasury stock, although management is authorized to
    issue new shares to the extent permitted by respective plan
    provisions. Refer to Note 5 for information on shares
    issued during the periods presented to employees and directors
    under various long-term incentive plans and share repurchases
    under the Company’s stock repurchase authorizations. The
    Company does not currently have a policy of repurchasing a
    specified number of shares issued under employee benefit
    programs during any particular time period.

Stock
    Options

During the periods presented, non-qualified stock options were
    granted to eligible employees under the 2003 Plan with exercise
    prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s
    stock on the grant date, a contractual term of ten years, and a
    two-year graded vesting period. Grants to outside directors
    under the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan included similar
    terms, but vested immediately. Additionally, “reload”
    options were awarded to eligible employees and directors to
    replace previously-owned Company stock used by those individuals
    to pay the exercise price, including related employment taxes,
    of vested pre-2004 option awards containing this accelerated
    ownership feature. These reload options are immediately vested,
    with an expiration date which is the same as the original option
    grant.

Management estimates the fair value of each annual stock option
    award on the date of grant using a lattice-based option
    valuation model. Due to the already-vested status and short
    expected term of reload options, management uses a Black-Scholes
    model to value such awards. Composite assumptions, which are not
    materially different for each of the two models, are presented
    in the following table. Weighted-average values are disclosed
    for certain inputs which incorporate a range of assumptions.
    Expected volatilities are based principally on historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock, and to a lesser extent,
    on implied volatilities from traded options on the
    Company’s stock. For the lattice-based model, historical
    volatility corresponds to the contractual term of the options
    granted; whereas, for the Black-Scholes model, historical
    volatility corresponds to the expected term. The Company
    generally uses historical data to estimate option exercise and
    employee termination within the valuation models; separate
    groups of employees that have similar historical exercise
    behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The
    expected term of options granted (which is an input to the
    Black-Scholes model and an output from the lattice-based model)
    represents the period of time that options granted are expected
    to be outstanding; the weighted-average expected term for all
    employee groups is presented in the following table. The
    risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the
    options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
    at the time of grant.

Other
    stock-based awards

During the periods presented, other stock-based awards consisted
    principally of executive performance shares and restricted stock
    granted under the 2003 Plan.

In 2005 and 2006, the Company granted performance shares to a
    limited number of senior executive-level employees, which
    entitled these employees to receive a specified number of shares
    of the Company’s common stock on the vesting date, provided
    cumulative three-year net sales growth targets were achieved.
    Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),
    management has estimated the fair value of performance share
    awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the
    date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated
    dividends foregone during the performance period. The 2005 and
    2006 target grants (as revised for non-vested forfeitures and
    other adjustments) currently correspond to approximately 275,000
    and 260,000 shares, respectively; each with a grant-date
    fair value of approximately $41 per share. The actual
    number of shares issued on the vesting date could range from
    zero to 200% of target, depending on actual performance
    achieved. Based on the market price of the Company’s common
    stock at year-end 2006, the maximum future value that could be
    awarded on the vesting date is (in millions): 2005
    award−$27.5; 2006 award−$25.8. In addition to these
    performance share plans, a 2003 performance unit plan (payable
    in stock or cash under certain conditions) was settled at 74% of
    target in February 2006 for a total dollar equivalent of
    $2.9 million.

The Company also periodically grants restricted stock and
    restricted stock units to eligible employees under the 2003
    Plan. Restrictions with respect to sale or transferability
    generally lapse after three years and the grantee is normally
    entitled to receive shareholder dividends during the vesting
    period. Management estimates the fair value of restricted stock
    grants based on the market price of the underlying stock on the
    date of grant. A summary of restricted stock activity for the
    year ended December 30, 2006, is presented in the following
    table:

Note 9

Pension
    benefits

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign pension plans
    to provide retirement benefits for its employees. The majority
    of these plans are funded or unfunded defined benefit plans,
    although the Company does participate in a few multiemployer or
    other defined contribution plans for certain employee groups.
    Defined benefits for salaried employees are generally based on
    salary and years of service, while union employee benefits are
    generally a negotiated amount for each year of service. The
    Company uses its fiscal year end as the measurement date for its
    defined benefit plans.

Obligations
    and funded status

The aggregate change in projected benefit obligation, plan
    assets, and funded status is presented in the following tables.
    The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” as of the end of its 2006 fiscal year. The impact of
    the adoption is discussed in Note 1. The standard generally
    requires company plan sponsors to reflect the net over- or under-



funded position of a defined postretirement benefit plan as an
    asset or liability on the balance sheet.

Expense

The components of pension expense are presented in the following
    table. Pension expense for defined contribution plans relates
    principally to multiemployer plans in which the Company
    participates on behalf of certain unionized workforces in the
    United States. The amounts for 2006 and 2005 include charges of
    approximately $4 million and $16 million,
    respectively, for the Company’s current estimate of a
    multiemployer plan withdrawal liability, which is further
    described in Note 3.

Any arising obligation-related experience gain or loss is
    amortized using a straight-line method over the average
    remaining service period of active plan participants. Any
    asset-related experience gain or loss is recognized as described
    on page 46. The estimated net experience loss and prior
    service cost for defined benefit pension plans that will be
    amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into
    pension expense over the next fiscal year are approximately
    $61 million and $13 million, respectively.

Net losses from curtailment and special termination benefits
    recognized in 2006 are related primarily to plant workforce
    reductions in the United States and England, as further
    described in Note 3. Net losses from curtailment and
    special termination benefits recognized in 2004 are related
    primarily to special termination benefits granted to the
    Company’s former CEO and other former executive officers
    pursuant to separation agreements, and to a lesser extent,
    liquidation of the Company’s pension fund in South Africa
    and plant workforce reductions in Great Britain.

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries sponsor 401(k) or
    similar savings plans for active employees. Expense related



to these plans was (in millions): 2006–$33; 2005–$30;
    2004–$26. Company contributions to these savings plans
    approximate annual expense. Company contributions to
    multiemployer and other defined contribution pension plans
    approximate the amount of annual expense presented in the
    preceding table.

To determine the overall expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets, the Company works with third party financial
    consultants to model expected returns over a

20-year

investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix
    of its major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a
    combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and
    forward-looking views of the financial markets including
    consideration of current yields on long-term bonds,
    price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and
    long-term inflation. The U.S. model, which corresponds to
    approximately 70% of consolidated pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan assets, incorporates a long-term
    inflation assumption of 2.8% and an active management premium of
    1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Similar
    methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets,
    reflecting local economic conditions. Although management
    reviews the Company’s expected long-term rates of return
    annually, the benefit trust investment performance for one
    particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence
    this evaluation. The expected rates of return are generally not
    revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a
    “more likely than not” corridor of between the
    25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term
    returns, as determined by the Company’s modeling process.
    The expected rate of return for 2006 of 8.9% equated to
    approximately the 50th percentile expectation. Any future
    variance between the expected and actual rates of return on plan
    assets is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over
    a five-year period and once recognized, experience gains and
    losses are amortized using a declining-balance method over the
    average remaining service period of active plan participants.

The Company’s investment strategy for its major defined
    benefit plans is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset
    classes with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash
    requirements as they become due. Assets are invested in a
    prudent manner to maintain the security of funds while
    maximizing returns within the Company’s guidelines. The
    current weighted-average target asset allocation reflected by
    this strategy is: equity securities−74%; debt
    securities−24%; other−2%. Investment in Company
    common stock represented 1.5% of consolidated plan assets at
    December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Plan funding
    strategies are influenced by tax regulations. The Company
    currently expects to contribute approximately $39 million
    to its defined benefit pension plans during 2007.

Benefit

Note 10

Nonpension
    postretirement and postemployment benefits

Postretirement

The Company sponsors a number of plans to provide health care
    and other welfare benefits to retired employees in the United
    States and Canada, who have met certain age and service
    requirements. The majority of these plans are funded or unfunded
    defined benefit plans, although the Company does participate in
    a few multiemployer or other defined contribution plans for
    certain employee groups. The Company contributes to voluntary
    employee benefit association (VEBA) trusts to fund certain
    U.S. retiree health



and welfare benefit obligations. The Company uses its fiscal
    year end as the measurement date for these plans.

Obligations
    and funded status

The aggregate change in accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation, plan assets, and funded status is presented in the
    following tables. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans” as of the end of its 2006
    fiscal year. The impact of the adoption is discussed in
    Note 1. The standard generally requires company plan
    sponsors to reflect the net over- or under-funded position of a
    defined postretirement benefit plan as an asset or liability on
    the balance sheet.

    defined benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated
    other comprehensive income into nonpension postretirement
    benefit expense over the next fiscal year is approximately
    $24 million, partially offset by amortization of prior
    service credit of $3 million.

Net losses from curtailment and special termination benefits

The Company determines the overall expected long-term rate of

The assumed health care cost trend rate is 9.5% for 2007,
    decreasing gradually to 4.75% by the year 2012 and remaining at
    that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect the
    Company’s recent historical experience and
    management’s expectations regarding future trends. A one

The Company’s asset investment strategy for its VEBA trusts

    Note 9. The current target asset allocation is 75% equity
    securities and 25% debt securities. The Company currently
    expects to contribute approximately $15 million to its VEBA
    trusts during 2007.

Postemployment

Under certain conditions, the Company provides benefits to
    former or inactive employees in the United States and several
    foreign locations, including salary continuance, severance, and
    long-term disability. The Company recognizes an obligation for
    any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service.
    Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with
    service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather
    than years of service) or costs arising from actions that offer
    benefits to employees in excess of those specified in the
    respective plans are charged to expense when incurred. The
    Company’s postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.
    Actuarial assumptions used are generally consistent with those
    presented for pension benefits on page 46. The Company
    previously applied postretirement accounting concepts for
    purposes of recognizing its postemployment benefit obligations.
    Accordingly, the Company’s adoption of
    SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” as
    of the end of its 2006 fiscal year impacted its presentation of
    postemployment benefits as discussed in Note 1. The

As presented in the preceding table, the Company’s 2006
    consolidated provision for income taxes included two
    significant, but partially-offsetting, discrete adjustments.
    First, during the second quarter, the Company revised its
    repatriation plan for certain foreign earnings, giving rise to
    an incremental net tax cost of $18 million. Also in the
    second quarter, the Company reduced its reserves for uncertain
    tax positions by $25 million, related principally to
    closure of several domestic tax audits.

The consolidated effective income tax rate for 2004 of nearly
    35% was higher than the rates for 2006 and 2005 primarily
    because this period preceded the final reorganization of the
    Company’s European operations which favorably affected the
    country-weighting impact on the rate. (Refer to Note 3 for
    further information on this initiative.) Additionally, the 2004
    consolidated effective income tax rate included a provision of
    approximately $40 million, partially offset by related
    foreign tax credits of approximately $12 million, for
    approximately $1.1 billion of dividends from foreign
    subsidiaries which the Company elected to repatriate in 2005
    under the American Jobs Creation Act. Finally, 2005 was the
    first year in which the Company was permitted to claim a
    phased-in deduction from U.S. taxable income equal to a
    stipulated percentage of qualified production income
    (“QPI”).

Generally, the changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax
    assets and corresponding impacts on the effective income tax
    rate result from management’s assessment of the
    Company’s ability to utilize certain operating loss and tax
    credit carryforwards prior to expiration. For 2004, the
    1.5 percent rate reduction presented in the preceding table
    primarily reflects reversal of a valuation allowance against
    U.S. foreign tax credits, which were utilized in
    conjunction with the aforementioned 2005 foreign earnings
    repatriation. Total tax benefits of carryforwards at year-end
    2006 and 2005 were approximately $29 million and
    $23 million, respectively. Of the total carryforwards at
    year-end 2006, less than $2 million expire in 2007 with the
    remainder principally expiring after five years. After valuation
    allowance, the carrying value of carryforward tax benefits at
    year-end 2006 was only $1 million.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the balance
    sheet at year end are presented in a table on page 50. The
    Company adopted SFAS No. 158 “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” as of the end of its 2006 fiscal year. The standard
    generally requires company plan sponsors to reflect the net
    over- or under-funded position of a defined postretirement
    benefit plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. Any
    unrecognized prior service cost, experience gains/losses, or
    transition obligation are reported as a component of other
    comprehensive income, net of tax, in shareholders’ equity.
    As a result of adopting this standard, the employee benefits
    component of the Company’s deferred tax assets increased
    (or liabilities decreased) by a total of $298.9 million at
    December 30, 2006. Refer to Note 1 for further
    information.

At December 30, 2006, accumulated foreign subsidiary
    earnings of approximately $1.1 billion were considered
    permanently invested in those businesses. Accordingly,
    U.S. income taxes have not been provided on these earnings.

Cash paid for income taxes was (in millions): 2006−$428;
    2005−$425; 2004−$421. Income tax benefits realized
    from stock option exercises and deductibility of other
    equity-based awards are presented in Note 8.

Note 12

Financial
    instruments and credit risk concentration

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are
    based on carrying value in the case of short-term items, quoted
    market prices for derivatives and investments, and in the case
    of long-term debt, incremental borrowing rates currently
    available on loans with similar terms and maturities. The
    carrying amounts of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents,
    receivables, and notes payable approximate fair value. The fair
    value of the Company’s long-term debt at December 30,
    2006, exceeded its carrying value by approximately
    $275 million.

The Company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a
    part of its ongoing business operations. Management uses
    derivative financial and commodity instruments, where
    appropriate, to manage these risks. In general, instruments used
    as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk associated with
    the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at
    the inception of the contract. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, the Company designates derivatives as
    either cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment
    hedges, or other contracts used to reduce volatility in the
    translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. Dollars.
    The fair values of all hedges are recorded in accounts
    receivable or other current liabilities. Gains and losses
    representing either hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components
    excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or hedges of
    translational exposure are recorded in other income (expense),
    net. Within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,
    settlements of cash flow and fair value hedges are classified as
    an operating activity; settlements of all other derivatives are
    classified as a financing activity.

Cash flow
    hedges

Qualifying derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges
    when the hedged item is a forecasted transaction. Gains and
    losses on these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive
    income until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings.
    When the hedged item is realized, gains or losses are
    reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the
    Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the same line item as the
    underlying transaction. For all cash flow hedges, gains and
    losses representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge
    components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness were
    insignificant during the periods presented.

The total net loss attributable to cash flow hedges recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive income at December 30,
    2006, was $32.6 million, related primarily to forward
    interest rate contracts settled during 2001 and 2003 in
    conjunction



with fixed rate long-term debt issuances and to a lesser extent,
    to

10-year

natural gas price swaps entered into in 2006. The interest rate
    contract losses will be reclassified into interest expense over
    the next 25 years. The natural gas swap losses will be
    reclassified to cost of goods sold over 10 years. Other
    insignificant amounts related to foreign currency and commodity
    price cash flow hedges will be reclassified into earnings during
    the next 18 months.

Fair value
    hedges

Qualifying derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges
    when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm
    commitment. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded
    in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. For
    all fair value hedges, gains and losses representing either
    hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the
    assessment of effectiveness were insignificant during the
    periods presented.

Net investment
    hedges

Qualifying derivative and nonderivative financial instruments
    are accounted for as net investment hedges when the hedged item
    is a nonfunctional currency investment in a subsidiary. Gains
    and losses on these instruments are recorded as a foreign
    currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income.

Other
    contracts

The Company also periodically enters into foreign currency
    forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in the
    translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. Dollars.
    Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in other
    income (expense), net, generally reducing the exposure to
    translation volatility during a full-year period.

Foreign
    exchange risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash
    flows related primarily to third-party purchases, intercompany
    transactions, and nonfunctional currency denominated third-party
    debt. The Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value
    of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows
    related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, the
    Company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign
    currency earnings to U.S. Dollars. Management assesses
    foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and
    translational volatility and enters into forward contracts,
    options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long
    or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are
    generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap
    agreements are established in conjunction with the term of
    underlying debt issues.

For foreign currency cash flow and fair value hedges, the
    assessment of effectiveness is generally based on changes in
    spot rates. Changes in time value are reported in other income
    (expense), net.

Interest rate
    risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard
    to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of
    variable rate debt. The Company periodically uses interest rate
    swaps, including forward-starting swaps, to reduce interest rate
    volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt
    issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus
    fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market
    conditions.

Variable-to-fixed

interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and
    the assessment of effectiveness is based on changes in the
    present value of interest payments on the underlying debt.

Fixed-to-variable

interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and
    the assessment of effectiveness is based on changes in the fair
    value of the underlying debt, using incremental borrowing rates
    currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities.

Price
    risk

The Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a
    result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials,
    fuel, and energy. The Company has historically used the
    combination of

long-term

contracts with suppliers, and exchange-traded futures and option
    contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage
    of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of
    generally less than 18 months. During 2006, the Company
    entered into two separate

10-year

over-the-counter

commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price
    of natural gas used principally in its manufacturing processes.

Commodity contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
    assessment of effectiveness for exchange-traded instruments is
    based on changes in futures prices. The assessment of
    effectiveness for

over-the-counter

transactions is based on changes in designated indexes.

Credit risk
    concentration

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by counterparties on derivative financial and
    commodity contracts. This credit loss is limited to the



cost of replacing these contracts at current market rates.
    Management believes the probability of such loss is remote.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash
    equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company places its
    investments in highly rated financial institutions and
    investment-grade short-term debt instruments, and limits the
    amount of credit exposure to any one entity. Management believes
    concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts
    receivable is limited due to the generally high credit quality
    of the Company’s major customers, as well as the large
    number and geographic dispersion of smaller customers. However,
    the Company conducts a disproportionate amount of business with
    a small number of large multinational grocery retailers, with
    the five largest accounts comprising approximately 27% of
    consolidated accounts receivable at December 30, 2006.

Operating
    segments

Kellogg Company is the world’s leading producer of cereal
    and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies,
    crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen
    waffles, and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and
    marketed globally. Principal markets for these products include
    the United States and United Kingdom. The Company currently
    manages its operations in four geographic operating segments,
    comprised of North America and the three International operating
    segments of Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. For the
    periods presented, the Asia Pacific operating segment included
    Australia and Asian markets. Beginning in 2007, this segment
    will also include South Africa, which was formerly a part of
    Europe.

The measurement of operating segment results is generally
    consistent with the presentation of the Consolidated Statement
    of Earnings and Balance Sheet. Intercompany transactions between
    operating segments were insignificant in all periods presented.

Management’s
    Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    notes. We believe that the consolidated financial statements
    present the Company’s financial position and results of
    operations in conformity with accounting principles that are
    generally accepted in the United States, using our best
    estimates and judgments as required.

The independent registered public accounting firm audits the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board and provides an objective, independent review of the
    fairness of reported operating results and financial position.

The Board of Directors of the Company has an Audit Committee
    composed of three non-management Directors. The Committee meets
    regularly with management, internal auditors, and the
    independent registered public accounting firm to review
    accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting
    matters.

Formal policies and procedures, including an active Ethics and
    Business Conduct program, support the internal controls and are
    designed to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of
    personal and professional integrity. We have a vigorous internal
    audit program that independently evaluates the adequacy and
    effectiveness of these internal controls.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework,

management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 30, 2006. Our management’s
    assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 30, 2006 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which follows
    on page 56.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

of Kellogg Company:

We have completed integrated audits of Kellogg Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
    audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)1 present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Kellogg Company
    and its subsidiaries at December 30, 2006 and
    December 31, 2005, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 30, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
    conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounted
    for share-based compensation and defined benefit pension, other
    postretirement, and postemployment plans in 2006.

Internal control
    over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting, appearing under Item 8, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 30, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9.

Changes in and
    Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
    Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls and
    Procedures

(a) We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
    our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure under

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e).

Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, rather than absolute,
    assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

As of December 30, 2006, management carried out an
    evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
    reasonable assurance level.

(b) Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002, we have included a report of management’s
    assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as part of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

The independent registered public accounting firm of
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also attested to, and reported on,
    management’s assessment of the internal control over
    financial reporting. Management’s report and the
    independent registered public accounting firm’s attestation
    report are included in our 2006 financial statements in
    Item 8 of this Report under the captions entitled
    “Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting” and “Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm” and are incorporated
    herein by reference.

(c) During the last fiscal quarter, there have been no
    changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Five plans (including one individual compensation arrangement)
    are included in the “Equity compensation plans not approved
    by security holders” line: the Kellogg Share Incentive
    Plan, which was adopted in 2002 and is available to most U.K.
    employees of specified Kellogg Company subsidiaries; a similar
    plan, which is available to employees in the Republic of
    Ireland; the Kellogg Company Executive Stock Purchase Plan,
    which was adopted in 2002 and is available to selected senior
    level Kellogg employees; the Deferred Compensation Plan for
    Non-Employee Directors, which was adopted in 1986 and amended in
    1993 and 2002; and a non-qualified stock option granted in 2000
    to Mr. Jenness, when he had just been appointed a Kellogg
    Director, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.

Under the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, eligible U.K. employees
    may contribute up to 1,500 Pounds Sterling annually to the plan
    through payroll deductions. The trustees of the plan use those
    contributions to buy shares of our common stock at fair market
    value on the open market, with Kellogg matching those
    contributions on a 1:1 basis. Shares must be withdrawn from the
    plan when employees cease employment. Under current law,
    eligible employees generally receive certain income and other
    tax benefits if those shares are held in the plan for a
    specified number of years. A similar plan is also available to
    employees in the Republic of Ireland. As these plans are open
    market plans with no set overall maximum, no amounts for these
    plans are included in the above table. However, approximately
    80,000 shares were purchased by eligible employees under
    the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, the plan for the Republic of
    Ireland and other similar predecessor plans during 2006, with
    approximately an additional 80,000 shares being provided as
    matched shares.

Under the Kellogg Company Executive Stock Purchase Plan,
    selected senior level Kellogg employees may elect to use
    all or part of their annual bonus, on an after-tax basis, to
    purchase shares of our common stock at fair market value (as
    determined over a

thirty-day

trading period). No more than 500,000 treasury shares are
    authorized for use under this plan.

Under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors,
    non-employee Directors may elect to defer all or part of their
    compensation (other than expense reimbursement) into units which
    are credited to their accounts. The units have a value equal to
    the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the
    appropriate date, with dividend equivalents being earned on the
    whole units in non-employee Directors’ accounts. Units may
    be paid in either cash or shares of our common stock, either in
    a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments, with the
    payments to begin as soon as practicable after the non-employee
    Director’s service as a Director terminates. No more than
    150,000 shares are authorized for use under this plan, none
    of which had been issued or allocated for issuance as of
    December 30, 2006. Because Directors may elect, and are
    likely to elect, a distribution of cash rather than shares, the
    contingently issuable shares are not included in column
    (a) of the table above.

When Mr. Jenness joined Kellogg as a director in 2000, he
    was granted a non-qualified stock option to purchase
    300,000 shares of our common stock. In connection with this
    option, which was to vest over three annual installments, he
    agreed to devote 50% of his working time to consulting with
    Kellogg, with further vesting to immediately stop if he was no
    longer willing to devote such amount of time to consulting with
    Kellogg or if Kellogg decided that it no longer wishes to
    receive such services. During 2001, Kellogg and Mr. Jenness
    agreed to terminate the consulting relationship, which
    immediately terminated the unvested 200,000 shares. This
    option contains the AOF feature described in the Proxy Statement.
