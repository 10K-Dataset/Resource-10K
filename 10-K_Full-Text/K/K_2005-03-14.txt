PART I

Item 1.

Business

The Company.

Kellogg Company, incorporated in Delaware in
1922, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and
marketing of ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods.

The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company
is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek,
Michigan Creek 49016-3599. Unless otherwise specified or
indicated by the context, the term “Company” as used
in this report means Kellogg Company, its divisions and
subsidiaries.

In March, 2001, the Company acquired Keebler Foods Company in a
cash transaction valued at $4.56 billion.

Financial Information About Segments.

The information
called for by this Item is incorporated herein by reference from
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 50 and 51 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Principal Products.

The principal products of the Company
are ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, such as cookies,
crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, frozen waffles and meat
alternatives. These products were, as of January 1, 2005,
manufactured by the Company in 17 countries and marketed in more
than 180 countries. The Company’s cereal products are
generally marketed under the

Kellogg’s

name
and are sold principally to the grocery trade through direct
sales forces for resale to consumers. The Company uses broker
and distribution arrangements for certain products. It also
generally uses these, or similar arrangements, in less-developed
market areas or in those market areas outside of its focus.

The Company also markets cookies, crackers, and other
convenience foods, under brands such as

Kellogg’s,
Keebler, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin

and

Famous Amos,

to supermarkets in the United States through a direct
store-door (DSD) delivery system, although other
distribution methods are also used.

Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of the
Company’s products for the years 2002 through 2004 is found
in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 50 and 51 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Raw Materials.

Agricultural commodities are the principal
raw materials used in the Company’s products. Cartonboard,
corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials
used by the Company. World supplies and prices of such
commodities (which include such packaging materials) are
constantly monitored, as are government trade policies. The cost
of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government
policy and regulation, weather conditions, or other unforeseen
circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and
improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes
of the Company’s short-term and long-term requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products produced by the
Company in the United States include corn grits, wheat and wheat
derivatives, oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and
soybean derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners, flour,
shortening, dairy products, eggs, and other filling ingredients,
which ingredients are obtained from various sources. Most of
these commodities are purchased principally from sources in the
United States.

The Company enters into long-term contracts for the commodities
described in this section and purchases these items on the open
market, depending on the Company’s view of possible price
fluctuations, supply levels, and the Company’s relative
negotiating power. While the cost of some of these commodities
has, and may continue to, increase over time, the Company
believes that it will be able to purchase an adequate supply of
these items as needed. The Company also uses commodity futures
and options to hedge some of its costs.

Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based
operations are available in adequate supply and are sometimes
imported from countries other than those where used in
manufacture.



Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international
facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane, which
are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers.
Short-term standby propane storage exists at several plants for
use in the event of interruption in natural gas supplies. Oil
may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in
the event of natural gas shortages or when its use presents
economic advantages. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel
fuel are used in connection with the distribution of the
Company’s products.

Trademarks and Technology.

Generally, the Company’s
products are marketed under trademarks it owns. The
Company’s principal trademarks are its housemarks, brand
names, slogans, and designs related to cereals and convenience

also licensing third parties to use these marks on various

Company’s ready-to-eat cereals, along with

L’
Eggo my



Eggo,

used in connection with the Company’s
frozen waffles and pancakes, and

Elfin Magic

used
in connection with convenience food products are also important
Company trademarks.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when taken as a
whole, are important to the Company’s business. Certain
individual trademarks are also important to the Company’s
business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are
generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their
registrations are properly maintained and they have not been
found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can
also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks
are in use.

The Company considers that, taken as a whole, the rights under
its various patents, which expire from time to time, are a
valuable asset, but the Company does not believe that its
businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or
group of related patents. The Company’s activities under
licenses or other franchises or concessions which it holds are
similarly a valuable asset, but are not believed to be material.

Seasonality.

Demand for the Company’s products has
generally been approximately level throughout the year, although
some of the Company’s convenience foods have a bias for
stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and
holidays. The Company also custom-bakes cookies for the Girl
Scouts of the U.S.A., which are principally sold in the first
quarter of the year.

Working Capital.

Although terms vary around the world and
by business types, in the United States the Company generally
has required payment for goods sold eleven or sixteen days
subsequent to the date of invoice as 2% 10/net 11 or 1% 15/net
16. Receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by
borrowings, provide for the Company’s payment of dividends,
capital expansion, and for other operating expenses and working
capital needs.

Customers.

The Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 14%
of consolidated net sales during 2004, comprised principally of
sales within the United States. At January 1, 2005,
approximately 11% of the Company’s consolidated receivables
balance and 19% of the Company’s U.S. receivables
balance was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
and its affiliates. During 2004, the Company’s top five
customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 26% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales and approximately 32% of
U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide
consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and the
Company believes that this trend is likely to continue. Although
the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time
could negatively impact the Company’s sales and profits,
the Company does not anticipate that this will occur to a
significant extent due to the consumer demand for the
Company’s products and the Company’s relationships
with its customers. Products of the Company have been generally
sold through its own sales forces and through broker and
distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to
consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service
establishments.

Backlog.

For the most part, orders are filled within a
few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time
prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at
January 1, 2005, and December 27, 2003, was not
material to the Company.

Competition.

The Company has experienced, and expects to
continue to experience, intense competition for sales of all of
its principal products in its major product categories, both
domestically and internationally. The Company’s products
compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature
as well as unadvertised and private label products, which are
typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with other
food products. Principal methods and factors of competition
include new product introductions, product quality, taste,
convenience, nutritional value, price, advertising, and
promotion.

Research and Development.

Research to support and expand
the use of the Company’s existing products and to develop
new food products is carried on at the W.K. Kellogg Institute
for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and
at other locations around the world. The Company’s
expenditures for research and development were approximately
$148.9 million in 2004, $126.7 million in 2003 and
$106.4 million in 2002.



Regulation.

The Company’s activities in the United
States are subject to regulation by various government agencies,
including the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade
Commission and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and
Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various
state and local agencies also regulate the Company’s
activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United
States, including those of the European Union and various
countries, states and municipalities, also regulate the
Company’s activities.

Environmental Matters.

The Company’s facilities are
subject to various U.S. and foreign federal, state, and local
laws and regulations regarding the discharge of material into
the environment and the protection of the environment in other
ways. The Company is not a party to any material proceedings
arising under these regulations. The Company believes that
compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will
not materially affect the consolidated financial condition or
the competitive position of the Company. The Company is
currently in substantial compliance with all material
environmental regulations affecting the Company and its
properties.

Employees.

At January 1, 2005, the Company had
approximately 25,000 employees.

Properties

The Company’s corporate headquarters and principal research
and development facilities are located in Battle Creek, Michigan.

The Company operated, as of January 31, 2005, manufacturing
plants and warehouses totaling more than 19 million
(19,000,000) square feet of building area in the United States
and other countries. The Company’s plants have been
designed and constructed to meet its specific production
requirements, and the Company periodically invests money for
capital and technological improvements. At the time of its
selection, each



location was considered to be favorable, based on the location
of markets, sources of raw materials, availability of suitable
labor, transportation facilities, location of other Company
plants producing similar products, and other factors.
Manufacturing facilities of the Company in the United States
include four cereal plants and warehouses located in Battle
Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee;
and Omaha, Nebraska and other plants in San Jose,
California; Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon, and Rome,
Georgia; Chicago and Des Plaines, Illinois; Kansas City, Kansas;
Florence, Louisville, and Pikeville, Kentucky; Grand Rapids,
Michigan; Blue Anchor, New Jersey; Cary and Charlotte, North
Carolina; Cincinnati, Fremont, and Zanesville, Ohio; Muncy,

with warehousing facilities, in Australia, Brazil, Canada,
Colombia, Ecuador, Germany, Great Britain, Guatemala, India,
Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and
Venezuela.

The principal properties of the Company, including its major
office facilities, generally are owned by the Company, although
some manufacturing facilities are leased, and no owned property
is subject to any major lien or other encumbrance. Distribution
facilities and offices of non-plant locations typically are
leased. In general, the Company considers its facilities, taken
as a whole, to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient capacity
for its current operations.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

(a) The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure based on
management’s interpretation of the definition of
“disclosure controls and procedures,” in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, rather than absolute,
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.

(b) Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, the Company has included a report of management’s
assessment of the design and effectiveness of its internal
control as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
independent registered public accounting firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also attested to, and reported on,
management’s assessment of the internal control over
financial reporting. Management’s report and the
independent registered public accounting firm’s attestation
report are included in the Company’s 2004 financial
statements under the captions entitled “Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” and
“Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm” and are incorporated herein by reference.

(c) During the last fiscal quarter, except as indicated
below, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As was
previously reported, the Company was in the process of rolling
out its SAP information technology system on a global basis and
implementing a major initiative to improve the organizational
design and effectiveness of its pan-European operations. In
connection with these activities, the Company successfully
transitioned the remaining portion of its European operations to
the SAP information technology system during the last fiscal
quarter and in very early 2005. Management does not, however,
believe that this adversely affected the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

Five plans (including one individual compensation arrangement)
are included in “Equity compensation plans not approved by
security holders”: the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, which
was adopted in 2002 and is available to most U.K. employees
of specified Kellogg Company subsidiaries; a somewhat similar
plan which is available to employees in the Republic of Ireland;
the Kellogg Company Executive Stock Purchase Plan, which was
adopted in 2002 and is available to selected senior level
employees of the Company; the Deferred Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors, which was adopted in 1986 and amended in
1993 and 2002 and a non-qualified stock option granted in 2000
to James Jenness, one of the Company’s directors.

Under the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, eligible
U.K. employees may contribute up to 1,500 Pounds Sterling
annually to the Plan through payroll deductions. The trustees of
the Plan use those contributions to buy shares at fair market
value on the open market, with the Company matching those
contributions on a 1:1 basis. Shares must be withdrawn from the
Plan when employees cease employment. Under current law,



eligible employees generally receive specified income and other
tax benefits if those shares are held in the Plan for five
years. A somewhat similar plan is also available to employees in
the Republic of Ireland. As these Plans are open market plans
with no set overall maximum, no amounts for these Plans are
included in the above table. However, approximately
82,000 shares were purchased by eligible employees under
the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, the somewhat similar plan in
the Republic of Ireland and somewhat similar predecessor plans
during 2004, with approximately an additional 82,000 shares
being provided as matched shares.

Under the Kellogg Company Executive Stock Purchase Plan,
selected senior level employees may elect to use all or part of
their annual bonus, on an after-tax basis, to purchase shares of
the Company’s common stock at fair market value (as
determined over a thirty-day trading period). No more than
500,000 treasury shares are authorized for use under the Plan.

Under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors,
non-employee directors may elect to defer all or part of their
compensation (other than expense reimbursement) into units which
are credited to their accounts. The units have a value equal to
the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common
stock on the appropriate date, with dividend equivalents being
earned on the whole units in non-employee directors’
accounts. Units may be paid in either cash or shares of the
Company’s common stock, either in a lump sum or in up to
ten annual installments, with the payments to begin as soon as
practicable after the non-employee director’s service as a
director terminates. No more than 150,000 shares are
authorized for use under the Plan, none of which had been issued
or allocated for issuance as of January 1, 2005. Based on
deferrals at January 1, 2005, approximately
134,000 shares were contingently issuable to participating
Directors. Because Directors may elect, and are likely to elect,
a distribution of cash rather than shares, the contingently
issuable shares are not included in column (a) of the table
above.

When James Jenness joined the Company as a director in 2000, he
was granted a non-qualified stock option to
purchase 300,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock. In connection with this option, which was to vest over
three annual installments, he agreed to devote fifty percent of
his working time to consulting with the Company, with further
vesting to immediately stop if he was no longer willing to
devote such amount of time to consulting with the Company or if
the Company decided that it no longer wishes to receive such
services. During 2001, the Company and Mr. Jenness agreed
to terminate the consulting relationship, which immediately
terminated the unvested 200,000 shares. This option
contains the AOF feature described in the Summary Compensation
Table of the Proxy Statement.
