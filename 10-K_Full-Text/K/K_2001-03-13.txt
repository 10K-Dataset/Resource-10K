PART I

Item 1.  Business

The Company.

Kellogg Company, incorporated in Delaware in
1922, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and
marketing of ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods products.

Kellogg Company reached agreement in October 2000 to acquire
Keebler Foods Company in an acquisition which is currently
expected to close in late March 2001. Unless otherwise specified
or indicated by the context, the information given, or
incorporated by reference, in this report does not reflect this
acquisition.

The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company
is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek,
Michigan 49016-3599. Unless otherwise specified or indicated by
the context, the term “Company” as used in this report
means Kellogg Company, its divisions and subsidiaries.

Financial Information About Segments.

The information
called for by this Item is incorporated herein by reference from
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on
page 38 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Principal Products.

The principal products of the Company
are ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods products, such as
toaster pastries, cereal bars, frozen waffles, wholesome snacks
and meat alternatives. These cereals and products were, as of
December 31, 2000, manufactured in 19 countries and
distributed in more than 160 countries. The Company’s
products are generally marketed under the

Kellogg’s

and

Morningstar Farms

names and are sold principally to the grocery trade through
direct sales forces for resale to consumers. The Company uses
broker and distribution arrangements for certain products. It
also generally uses these, or similar arrangements, in
less-developed market areas or in those market areas outside of
its focus.

After completing the Keebler Foods Company acquisition, the
Company also plans to market cookies, crackers and other
convenience food products of the Keebler Foods Company under
other brands such as

Keebler

,

Cheez-It

,

Murray

, and

Famous
Amos

, and manufacture private label cookies, crackers,
and other products. These branded products are generally to be
marketed to supermarkets in the United States through a direct
store door (DSD) delivery system, although other distribution
methods are also to be used. The Company also plans to market
some of its other convenience foods products in the United
States through this DSD system.

Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of
ready-to-eat cereals and the Company’s convenience foods
products for the years 1998 through 2000 is found in
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on
page 38 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Raw Materials.

Agricultural commodities are the principal
raw materials used in the Company’s products. Cartonboard,
corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials
used by the Company. World supplies and prices of such
commodities (which include such packaging materials) are
constantly monitored, as are government trade policies. The cost
of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government
policy and regulation, weather conditions, or other unforeseen
circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and
improve the qualities and supplies of such commodities for
purposes of the Company’s short-term and long-term
requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products produced by the
Company in the United States include corn grits, oats, rice,
soybeans, various fruits, sweeteners, wheat, and wheat
derivatives. These commodities are purchased principally from
sources in the United States. In producing convenience foods
products, the Company may use flour, shortening, sweeteners,
dairy products, eggs, fruit, chocolate, and other filling
ingredients, which ingredients are obtained from various sources.

The Company both enters into long-term contracts for the
commodities described in this section and purchases these items
on the open market, depending on the Company’s view of
possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and the
Company’s relative negotiating power. While the cost of
these commodities may


increase over time, the Company believes that it will be able to
purchase an adequate supply of these items as needed. The
Company also uses commodity futures and options to hedge some of
its costs.

Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based
operations are available in adequate supply and are sometimes
imported from countries other than those where used in
manufacture.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international
facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane,
commodities obtained from local utilities or other local
suppliers. Short-term standby propane storage exists at several
plants for use in the event of interruption in natural gas
supplies. Additionally, oil may be used to fuel certain
operations at various plants in the event of natural gas
shortages or when its use presents economic advantages.

Trademarks and Technology.

Generally, the
Company’s products are marketed under trademarks owned by
the Company. The Company’s principal trademarks are its
housemark, brand names, slogans, and designs related to cereals
and other convenience foods products manufactured and marketed
by the Company as well as licensed uses of these marks on

Keebler

,

Cheez-It

,

EL

. Other Keebler Foods Company trademarks
include

Ernie the Keebler Elf

and the


Hollow Tree

logo, which are used in connection
with Keebler Foods Company products. The Keebler Foods Company
is also the exclusive licensee of the CARR’S brand name in
the United States.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when taken as a
whole, are important to the Company’s business. Certain
individual trademarks are also important to the Company’s
business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are
generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their
registrations are properly maintained and they have not been
found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can
also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks
are in use.

The Company considers that, taken as a whole, the rights under
its various patents, which expire from time to time, are a
valuable asset, but the Company does not believe that its
businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or
group of related patents. The Company’s activities under
licenses or other franchises or concessions are not material.

Seasonality.

Demand for the Company’s products
has been approximately level throughout the year.

Working Capital.

Although terms vary around the world, in
the United States the Company generally has required payment for
goods sold 11 days subsequent to the date of invoice, with
a 2% discount allowed for payment within ten days. Receipts from
goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide for
the Company’s payment of dividends, capital expansion, and
for other operating expenses and working capital needs.

Customers.

The Company has not been, and does not
expect to be during 2001, dependent on any single customer or a
few customers for a material part of its sales. However, the
Company’s top five customers, collectively, accounted for
approximately 16.4% of consolidated net sales, with one of those
customers accounting for 9.2%. In addition, three of those
customers accounted for 17.6% of the Company’s U.S. sales,
with one of those customers accounting for approximately 12% of
the Company’s U.S. sales. There has been significant
worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years
and the Company believes that this trend is likely to continue.
Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length
of time could negatively impact the Company’s sales and
profits, the Company does not anticipate that this will occur to
a significant extent due to the consumer demand for the
Company’s products and the Company’s relationships
with its customers. Products of the Company have been generally
sold through its own sales forces and through broker and
distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to
consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service
establishments.

Backlog.

For the most part, orders are filled
within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at
any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders
at December 31, 2000, and December 31, 1999, was not
material to the Company.

Competition.

The Company has experienced, and
expects to continue to experience, intense competition for sales
of all of its principal products in its major markets, both
domestically and internationally. The Company’s products
compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature
as well as unadvertised and private label products, which are
typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with other
food products with different characteristics. Principal methods
and factors of competition include new product introductions,
product quality, composition and nutritional value, price,
advertising, and promotion. As part of a strategy adopted in
October 2000, the Company intends during 2001 to focus its
efforts on five key market areas and to increase its investment
in advertising and promotional activities related to its U.S.
cereal business.

Research and Development.

Research to support and
expand the use of the Company’s existing products and to
develop new food products is carried on at the W.K. Kellogg
Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek,
Michigan, and at other locations around the world. The
Company’s expenditures for research and development were
approximately $118.4 million in 2000, $104.1 million
in 1999, and $121.9 million in 1998.

Regulation.

The Company’s activities are
subject to regulation by various government agencies, including
the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture,
Federal Trade Commission, and


Department of Commerce in the U.S., and similar agencies outside
of the U.S., as well as various state and local agencies.

Environmental Matters.

The Company’s
facilities are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and
local laws and regulations regarding the discharge of material
into the environment and the protection of the environment in
other ways. The Company is not a party to any material
proceedings arising under these regulations. The Company
believes that compliance with existing environmental laws and
regulations will not materially affect the consolidated
financial condition or the competitive position of the Company.
The Company is currently in substantial compliance with all
material environmental regulations affecting the Company and its
properties.

Employees.

At December 31, 2000, the Company
had approximately 15,200 employees.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas.

The
information called for by this Item is incorporated herein by
reference from Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 38 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Forward-Looking Statements.

This Report contains,
or incorporates by reference, “forward-looking
statements” with projections concerning, among other
things, the Company’s strategy and plans for 2001; the
Keebler Foods Company acquisition and the Company’s sales,
products, distribution systems, business, and results after its
completion; the 2001 effective income tax rate; charges,
benefits and savings from restructuring actions and streamlining
initiatives; 2001 amortization expense and property addition
expenditures; the 2001 interest expense; the results of the Euro
conversion; and the impact of any accounting and disclosure
changes. Forward-looking statements include predictions of
future results or activities and may contain the words
“expects,” “believes,” “will,”
“will deliver,” “anticipates,”
“projects,” or words or phrases of similar meaning.
For example, forward-looking statements are found in this
Item 1 and several sections of Management’s Discussion
and Analysis incorporated by reference. The Company’s
actual results or activities may differ materially from these
predictions. In particular, future results or activities could
be affected by factors related to the pending Keebler
acquisition, including integration problems, failures to achieve
synergies, unanticipated liabilities and the substantial amount
of indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition (which
could, among other things, hinder the Company’s ability to
adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make the Company
more vulnerable in the event of a downturn, and place the
Company at a competitive disadvantage in relation to
less-leveraged competitors). The Company’s future results
could be affected by a variety of other factors, including
competitive conditions and their impact, pricing and promotional
and marketing spending and/or incremental pricing actions on
actual volumes and product mix; the effectiveness of advertising
and marketing spending or programs; the success of new product
introductions; the levels of spending on system initiatives,
properties, business opportunities, integration of acquired
businesses, and other general and administrative costs; the
availability of and interest rates on short-term financing;
changes in consumer preferences; commodity price and labor cost
fluctuations; expenditures necessary to carry out streamlining
initiatives and savings derived therefrom; foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations; changes in statutory tax and other
laws; and other items. Forward-looking statements speak only as
of the date they were made, and the Company undertakes no
obligation to publicly update them.

Item 2.  Properties

The Company’s corporate headquarters and principal research
and development facilities are located in Battle Creek, Michigan.

The Company operated, as of December 31, 2000,
manufacturing plants and warehouses totaling more than
12 million (12,000,000) square feet of building area in the
United States and other countries. The Company’s plants
have been designed and constructed to meet its specific
production requirements, and the Company periodically invests
money for capital and technological improvements. At the time of
its selection, each location was considered to be favorable,
based on the location of markets, sources of raw materials,
availability of suitable labor, transportation facilities,
location of other Company plants producing similar products, and
other factors. Manufacturing facilities of the Company in the
United States include four cereal plants and warehouses located
in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Memphis,
Tennessee; and


Omaha, Nebraska. The Company’s United States convenience
foods plants are located in San Jose, California; Atlanta,
Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Pikeville, Kentucky; Blue Anchor, New
Jersey; Worthington, Ohio; Zanesville, Ohio; Muncy,
Pennsylvania; and Rossville, Tennessee.

Outside the United States, the Company had, as of
December 31, 2000, additional manufacturing locations, some
with warehousing facilities, in Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Germany, Great Britain,
Guatemala, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea,
Spain, Thailand, and Venezuela.

The principal properties of the Company, including its major
office facilities, are owned by the Company and none is subject
to any major lien or other encumbrance. Distribution centers and
offices of non-plant locations typically are leased. The Company
considers its facilities generally suitable, adequate, and of
sufficient capacity for its current operations.
