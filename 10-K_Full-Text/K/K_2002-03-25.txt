PART I

Item 1. Business

The Company.

Kellogg
Company, incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries
are engaged in the manufacture and marketing of ready-to-eat
cereal and convenience foods.

Kellogg Company acquired Keebler Foods Company in
a transaction valued at $4.56 billion, which closed on
March 26, 2001. In connection with the acquisition, Kellogg
Company paid approximately $3.86 billion in cash and
assumed $696 million of debt, with $560 million of the
assumed debt being refinanced on the acquisition date.

The address of the principal business office of
Kellogg Company is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599,
Battle Creek, Michigan Creek 49016-3599. Unless otherwise
specified or indicated by the context, the term
“Company” as used in this report means Kellogg
Company, its divisions and subsidiaries.

Financial Information About
Segments.

The information called for
by this Item is incorporated herein by reference from
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
on page 42 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Principal Products.

The principal products of the Company are ready-to-eat cereals
and convenience foods, such as cookies, crackers, toaster
pastries, cereal bars, frozen waffles, meat alternatives, pie
crusts, and ice cream cones. These products were, as of
December 31, 2001, manufactured in 19 countries and
distributed in more than 160 countries. The Company’s
cereal products are generally marketed under the

Kellogg’s

name and are sold principally to
the grocery trade through direct sales forces for resale to
consumers. The Company uses broker and distribution arrangements
for certain products. It also generally uses these, or similar
arrangements, in less-developed market areas or in those market
areas outside of its focus.

The Company also markets cookies, crackers, and
other convenience foods of its Keebler Foods Company subsidiary
under other brands such as

Kellogg’s, Keebler,
Cheez-It, Murray,

and

Famous Amos,

and
manufactures private label cookies, crackers, and other
products. These branded products are generally marketed to
supermarkets in the United States through a direct store door
(DSD) delivery system, although other distribution methods are
also used. The Company also markets some of its other
convenience foods products in the United States through this DSD
system.

Additional information pertaining to the relative
sales of the Company’s products for the years 1999 through
2001 is found in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 42 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Raw Materials.

Agricultural commodities are the
principal raw materials used in the Company’s products.
Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging
materials used by the Company. World supplies and prices of such
commodities (which include such packaging materials) are
constantly monitored, as are government trade policies. The cost
of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government
policy and regulation, weather conditions, or other unforeseen
circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and
improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes
of the Company’s short-term and long-term requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products
produced by the Company in the United States include corn grits,
oats, rice, cocoa, soybeans and soybean derivatives, various
fruits, sweeteners, wheat, and wheat derivatives. These
commodities are purchased principally from sources in the United
States. In producing convenience foods products, the Company may
use flour, shortening, sweeteners, dairy products, eggs, fruit,
chocolate, and other filling ingredients, which ingredients are
obtained from various sources.

The Company both enters into long-term contracts
for the commodities described in this section and purchases
these items on the open market, depending on the Company’s
view of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and the
Company’s relative negotiating power. While the cost of
these commodities may increase over time, the Company believes
that it will be able to purchase an adequate supply of these
items as needed. The Company also uses commodity futures and
options to hedge some of its costs.



Raw materials and packaging needed for
internationally based operations are available in adequate
supply and are sometimes imported from countries other than
those where used in manufacture.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and
international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or
propane, commodities obtained from local utilities or other
local suppliers. Short-term standby propane storage exists at
several plants for use in the event of interruption in natural
gas supplies. Oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at
various plants in the event of natural gas shortages or when its
use presents economic advantages. In addition, considerable
amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the
distribution of the Company’s products.

Trademarks and Technology.

Generally, the Company’s products
are marketed under trademarks it owns. The Company’s
principal trademarks are its housemarks, brand names, slogans,

The slogans

The Best To You Each Morning,
The Original and Best, They’re Gr-r-reat!,

and

Eat it For Breakfast, Eat it For Life,

used in
connection with the Company’s ready-to-eat cereals, along
with

L’ Eggo my Eggo,

used in connection
with the Company’s frozen waffles and pancakes, and

Elfin Magic

used by the Keebler Foods subsidiary
in connection with convenience food products are also important
Company trademarks.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when
taken as a whole, are important to the Company’s business.
Certain individual trademarks are also important to the
Company’s business. Depending on the jurisdiction,
trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or
their registrations are properly maintained and they have not
been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks
can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the
trademarks are in use.

The Company considers that, taken as a whole, the
rights under its various patents, which expire from time to
time, are a valuable asset, but the Company does not believe
that its businesses are materially dependent on any single
patent or group of related patents. The Company’s
activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions
which it holds are not believed to be material.

Seasonality.

Demand
for the Company’s products has generally been approximately
level throughout the year, although some of the Company’s
private label convenience foods generally have stronger demand
in the first quarter and the Company’s other convenience
foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the
year.

Working Capital.

Although terms vary around the world, in the United States the
Company generally has required payment for goods sold
11 days subsequent to the date of invoice, generally with a
2% or 1% discount allowed for payment within ten days. Receipts
from goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide
for the Company’s payment of dividends, capital expansion,
and for other operating expenses and working capital needs.

Customers.

Historically, the Company has not been dependent on any single
customer or a few customers for a material part of its sales.
However, the Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11% of
consolidated net sales during 2001, comprised principally of
sales within the United States. Correspondingly, at
December 31, 2001, approximately 7% of the Company’s
consolidated receivables balance and 11% of the Company’s
U.S. receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries. During 2001, the
Company’s top five customers, collectively, accounted for
approximately 18% of both the Company’s consolidated and
U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide
consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and the
Company believes that this trend is likely to continue. Although
the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time
could negatively impact the Company’s sales and profits,
the Company does not anticipate that this will occur to a
significant extent due to the consumer demand for the
Company’s products and the Company’s relationships
with its customers. Products of the Company have been generally
sold through its own sales forces and through broker and
distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to
consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service
establishments.

Backlog.

For the
most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and
are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The
backlog of any unfilled orders at December 31, 2001, and
December 31, 2000, was not material to the Company.

Competition.

The
Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience,
intense competition for sales of all of its principal products
in its major product categories, both domestically and
internationally. The Company’s products compete with
advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as
unadvertised and private label products, which are typically
distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food
products with different characteristics. Principal methods and
factors of competition include new product introductions,
product quality, composition and nutritional value, price,
advertising, and promotion.

Research and
Development.

Research to support and
expand the use of the Company’s existing products and to
develop new food products is carried on at the W.K. Kellogg
Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek,
Michigan, and at other locations around the world. The
Company’s expenditures for research



and development were approximately
$110.2 million in 2001, $118.4 million in 2000, and
$104.1 million in 1999.

Regulation.

The
Company’s activities are subject to regulation by various
government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration,
Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, and
Department of Commerce in the United States, and various state
and local agencies, as well as similar agencies outside of the
United States.

Environmental
Matters.

The Company’s facilities
are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws
and regulations regarding the discharge of material into the
environment and the protection of the environment in other ways.
The Company is not a party to any material proceedings arising
under these regulations. The Company believes that compliance
with existing environmental laws and regulations will not
materially affect the consolidated financial condition or the
competitive position of the Company. The Company is currently in
substantial compliance with all material environmental
regulations affecting the Company and its properties.

Employees.

At
December 31, 2001, the Company had approximately 26,424
employees.

Financial Information About Geographic
Areas.

The information called for
by this Item is incorporated herein by reference from
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on
page 42 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Forward-Looking
Statements.

This Report contains,
or incorporates by reference, “forward-looking
statements” with projections concerning, among other
things, the Company’s strategy and plans; integration
activities, costs and savings related to the Keebler
acquisition; cash outlays and savings related to restructuring
actions; the impact of accounting changes; our ability to meet
interest and debt principal repayment obligations; effective
income tax rate; amortization expense; cash flow; property
addition expenditures; and interest expense. Forward-looking
statements include predictions of future results or activities
and may contain the words “expect,”
“believe,” “will,” “will deliver,”
“anticipate,” “project,” “should,”
or words or phrases of similar meaning. For example,
forward-looking statements are found in this Item 1 and in
several sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
incorporated by reference. The Company’s actual results or
activities may differ materially from these predictions. In
particular, future results or activities could be affected by
factors related to the Keebler acquisition, including
integration problems, failures to achieve synergies,
unanticipated liabilities, and the substantial amount of
indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition, which could,
among other things, hinder the Company’s ability to adjust
rapidly to changing market conditions, make the Company more
vulnerable in the event of a downturn, and place the Company at
a competitive disadvantage in relation to less-leveraged
competitors. The Company’s future results could be affected
by a variety of other factors, including competitive conditions
in our markets and categories and their impact; pricing and
promotional and marketing spending levels and/or incremental
pricing actions by the Company or others and their effect on
actual volumes and product mix; the effectiveness of advertising
and marketing spending or programs; the success of new product
introductions; the levels of spending on system initiatives,
properties, business opportunities, integration of acquired
businesses, and other general and administrative costs; the
availability of and interest rates on short-term financing;
changes in consumer preferences; commodity price and labor cost
fluctuations; expenditures necessary to carry out restructuring
initiatives and savings derived therefrom; U.S. and foreign
economic conditions, including foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations; changes in statutory tax and other laws; business
disruption from terrorist acts or a nation’s response to
them; U.S. and foreign regulations; and other items.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were
made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly
update them.

Item 2. Properties

The Company’s corporate headquarters and
principal research and development facilities are located in
Battle Creek, Michigan.

The Company operated, as of December 31,
2001, manufacturing plants and warehouses totaling more than
17 million (17,000,000) square feet of building area in the
United States and other countries. The



Company’s plants have been designed and
constructed to meet its specific production requirements, and
the Company periodically invests money for capital and
technological improvements. At the time of its selection, each
location was considered to be favorable, based on the location
of markets, sources of raw materials, availability of suitable
labor, transportation facilities, location of other Company
plants producing similar products, and other factors.
Manufacturing facilities of the Company in the United States
include four cereal plants and warehouses located in Battle
Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee;
and Omaha, Nebraska. The Company’s United States
convenience foods plants are located in San Jose, California;
Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon, and Rome, Georgia;
Chicago and Des Plaines, Illinois; Kansas City, Kansas;
Florence, Louisville, and Pikeville, Kentucky; Grand Rapids,
Michigan; Blue Anchor, New Jersey; Cary and Charlotte, North
Carolina; Cincinnati, Fremont, Worthington, and Zanesville,
Ohio; Marietta, Oklahoma; Muncy, Pennsylvania; and Cleveland and
Rossville, Tennessee.

Outside the United States, the Company had, as of
December 31, 2001, additional manufacturing locations, some
with warehousing facilities, in Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Germany, Great Britain,
Guatemala, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea,
Spain, Thailand, and Venezuela.

The principal properties of the Company,
including its major office facilities, generally are owned by
the Company, although some manufacturing facilities are leased,
and no owned property is subject to any major lien or other
encumbrance. Distribution facilities and offices of non-plant
locations typically are leased. In general, the Company
considers its facilities, taken as a whole, to be suitable,
adequate, and of sufficient capacity for its current operations.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company is not a party to any pending legal
proceedings which could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company on a consolidated basis,
nor are any of the Company’s properties or subsidiaries
subject to any such proceedings.
