PART 1.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

The
    Company.

Kellogg Company, founded in 1906 and
    incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries are
    engaged in the manufacture and marketing of

ready-to-eat

cereal and convenience foods.

The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company
    is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek,
    Michigan

49016-3599.

Unless otherwise specified or indicated by the context,
    “Kellogg,” “we,” “us” and
    “our” refer to Kellogg Company, its divisions and
    subsidiaries.

Financial Information About
    Segments.

Information on segments is located in
    Note 17 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements which are included herein under Part II,
    Item 8.

Principal
    Products.

Our principal products are

ready-to-eat

cereals and convenience foods, such as cookies, crackers,
    toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen waffles and
    veggie foods. These products were, as of February 23, 2009,
    manufactured by us in 19 countries and marketed in more than 180
    countries. Our cereal products are generally marketed under the

Kellogg’s

name and are sold principally to
    the grocery trade through direct sales forces for resale to
    consumers. We use broker and distribution arrangements for
    certain products. We also generally use these, or similar
    arrangements, in less-developed market areas or in those market
    areas outside of our focus.

We also market cookies, crackers, and other convenience foods,
    under brands such as

Kellogg’s, Keebler, Cheez-It,
    Murray, Austin

and

Famous Amos,

to
    supermarkets in the United States through a direct store-door
    (DSD) delivery system, although other distribution methods are
    also used.

Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of our
    products for the years 2006 through 2008 is located in
    Note 17 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which are included herein under Part II,
    Item 8.

Raw
    Materials.

Agricultural commodities are the
    principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard,
    corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials
    used by us. World supplies and prices of such commodities (which
    include such packaging materials) are constantly monitored, as
    are government trade policies. The cost of such commodities may
    fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation,
    weather conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances.
    Continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality
    and supply of such commodities for purposes of our short-term
    and long-term requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the
    United States include corn grits, wheat and wheat derivatives,
    oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean
    derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners, flour, vegetable oils,
    dairy products, eggs, and other filling ingredients, which are
    obtained from various sources. Most of these commodities are
    purchased principally from sources in the United States.

We enter into long-term contracts for the commodities described
    in this section and purchase these items on the open market,
    depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply
    levels, and our relative negotiating power. While the cost of
    some of these commodities has, and may continue to, increase
    over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an
    adequate supply of these items as needed. As further discussed
    herein under Part II, Item 7A, we also use commodity
    futures and options to hedge some of our costs.

Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based
    operations are available in adequate supply and are sometimes
    imported from countries other than those where used in
    manufacturing.

Natural gas and propane are the primary sources of energy used
    to power processing ovens at major domestic and international
    facilities, although certain locations may use oil or propane on
    a

back-up

or
    alternative basis. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel
    fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our
    products. As further discussed herein under Part II,
    Item 7A, we use

over-the-counter

commodity price swaps to hedge some of our natural gas costs.

Trademarks and
    Technology.

Generally, our products are marketed
    under trademarks we own. Our principal trademarks are our
    housemarks, brand names, slogans, and designs related to cereals
    and convenience foods manufactured and marketed by us, and we
    also grant licenses to third parties to use these marks on
    various goods. These trademarks include

    Differently

used in connection with meat and egg
    alternatives are also important Kellogg trademarks.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when taken as a
    whole, are important to our business. Certain individual
    trademarks are also important to our business. Depending on the
    jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are
    in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained and they have not been
    found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can
    also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks
    are in use.

We consider that, taken as a whole, the rights under our various
    patents, which expire from time to time, are a valuable asset,
    but we do not believe that our businesses are materially
    dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Our
    activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions
    which we hold are similarly a valuable asset, but are not
    believed to be material.

Seasonality.

Demand
    for our products has generally been approximately level
    throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods have
    a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to
    events and holidays. We also custom-bake cookies for the Girl
    Scouts of the U.S.A., which are principally sold in the first
    quarter of the year.

Working
    Capital.

Although terms vary around the world
    and by business types, in the United States we generally have
    required payment for goods sold eleven or sixteen days
    subsequent to the date of invoice as 2% 10/net 11 or 1% 15/net
    16. Receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by
    borrowings, provide for our payment of dividends, repurchases of
    our



common stock, capital expansion, and for other operating
    expenses and working capital needs.

Customers.

Our
    largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated net sales during
    2008, comprised principally of sales within the United States.
    At January 3, 2009, approximately 17% of our consolidated
    receivables balance and 27% of our U.S. receivables balance
    was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
    affiliates. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of
    net sales in 2008. During 2008, our top five customers,
    collectively, including Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately
    33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 42% of
    U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide
    consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and we
    believe that this trend is likely to continue. Although the loss
    of any large customer for an extended length of time could
    negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate
    that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer
    demand for our products and our relationships with our
    customers. Our products have been generally sold through our own
    sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements,
    and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores,
    restaurants, and other food service establishments.

Backlog.

For the
    most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and
    are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The
    backlog of any unfilled orders at January 3, 2009 and
    December 29, 2007 was not material to us.

Competition.

We
    have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense
    competition for sales of all of our principal products in our
    major product categories, both domestically and internationally.
    Our products compete with advertised and branded products of a
    similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label
    products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and
    generally with other food products. Principal methods and
    factors of competition include new product introductions,
    product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price,
    advertising and promotion.

Research and
    Development.

Research to support and expand the
    use of our existing products and to develop new food products is
    carried on at the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition
    Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at other locations
    around the world. Our expenditures for research and development
    were approximately $181 million in 2008, $179 million
    in 2007 and $191 million in 2006.

Regulation.

Our
    activities in the United States are subject to regulation by
    various government agencies, including the Food and Drug
    Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the Departments of
    Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation
    by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate
    our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United
    States, including those of the European Union and various
    countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our
    activities.

Environmental
    Matters.

Our facilities are subject to various
    U.S. and foreign, federal, state, and local laws and
    regulations regarding the discharge of material into the
    environment and the protection of the environment in other ways.
    We are not a party to any material proceedings arising under
    these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing
    environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect
    our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position.

Employees.

At
    January 3, 2009, we had approximately 32,400 employees.

Financial Information About
    Geographic Areas.

Forward-Looking
    Statements.

This Report contains
    “forward-looking statements” with projections
    concerning, among other things, our strategy, financial
    principles, and plans; initiatives, improvements and growth;
    sales, gross margins, advertising, promotion, merchandising,
    brand building, operating profit, and earnings per share;
    innovation; investments; capital expenditures; asset write-offs
    and expenditures and costs related to productivity or efficiency
    initiatives; the impact of accounting changes and significant
    accounting estimates; our ability to meet interest and debt
    principal repayment obligations; minimum contractual
    obligations; future common stock repurchases or debt reduction;
    effective income tax rate; cash flow and core working capital
    improvements; interest expense; commodity and energy prices; and
    employee benefit plan costs and funding. Forward-looking
    statements include predictions of future results or activities
    and may contain the words “expect,”
    “believe,” “will,” “will deliver,”
    “anticipate,” “project,” “should,”
    or words or phrases of similar meaning. For example,
    forward-looking statements are found in this Item 1 and in
    several sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
    Our actual results or activities may differ materially from
    these predictions. Our future results could be affected by a
    variety of factors, including the impact of competitive
    conditions; the effectiveness of pricing, advertising, and
    promotional programs; the success of innovation and new product
    introductions; the recoverability of the carrying value of
    goodwill and other intangibles; the success of productivity
    improvements and business transitions; commodity and energy
    prices, and labor costs; the availability of and interest rates
    on short-term and long-term financing; actual market performance
    of benefit plan trust investments; the levels of spending on
    systems initiatives, properties, business opportunities,
    integration of acquired businesses, and other general and
    administrative costs; changes in consumer behavior and
    preferences; the effect of U.S. and foreign economic
    conditions on items such as interest rates, statutory tax rates,
    currency conversion and availability; legal and regulatory
    factors; the ultimate impact of product recalls; business
    disruption or other losses from war, terrorist acts, or
    political unrest and the risks and uncertainties described in
    Item 1A below. Forward-looking statements speak only as of
    the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to
    publicly update them.

ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report,
    the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely
    affect our business, financial



condition and results of operations. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently
    deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and
    financial condition.

Our performance is affected by general economic and political
    conditions and taxation policies.

Our results in the past have been, and in the future may
    continue to be, materially affected by changes in general
    economic and political conditions in the United States and other
    countries, including the interest rate environment in which we
    conduct business, the financial markets through which we access
    capital and currency, political unrest and terrorist acts in the
    United States or other countries in which we carry on business.

The enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added
    tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in
    markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the
    future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our
    products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or
    on our results of operations.

We operate in the highly competitive food industry.

We face competition across our product lines, including

ready-to-eat

cereals and convenience foods, from other companies which have
    varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions.
    Some of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing
    and other resources, and competition with them in our various
    markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices,
    increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or lose
    category share, any of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business and financial results. Category share and
    growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful
    in introducing new products.

Our consolidated financial results and demand for our
    products are dependent on the successful development of new
    products and processes.

There are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may
    impact us and the industry as a whole. These include changing
    consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute
    products.

Our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer
    preferences and on successful new product and process
    development and product relaunches in response to such changes.
    We aim to introduce products or new or improved production
    processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence
    and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote
    significant focus to the development of new products and to the
    research, development and technology process functions of our
    business, we may not be successful in developing new products or
    our new products may not be commercially successful. Our future
    results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive
    position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of
    our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify,
    develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products
    in these changing markets.

An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other
    acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated
    operating results and net worth.

The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of
    acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and
    liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of
    other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, trade
    names, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition
    date. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to
    contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but
    must be evaluated by management at least annually for
    impairment. If carrying value exceeds current fair value, the
    intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value
    via a charge to earnings. Events and conditions which could
    result in an impairment include changes in the industries in
    which we operate, including competition and advances in
    technology; a significant product liability or intellectual
    property claim; or other factors leading to reduction in
    expected sales or profitability. Should the value of one or more
    of the acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated
    earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected.

As of January 3, 2009, the carrying value of intangible
    assets totaled approximately $5.10 billion, of which
    $3.64 billion was goodwill and $1.46 billion
    represented trademarks, tradenames, and other acquired
    intangibles compared to total assets of $10.95 billion and
    shareholders’ equity of $1.45 billion.

We may not achieve our targeted cost savings from cost
    reduction initiatives.

Our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient
    producer in a highly competitive industry. We have invested a
    significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our
    operational facilities. Ongoing operational issues are likely to
    occur when carrying out major production, procurement, or
    logistical changes and these, as well as any failure by us to
    achieve our planned cost savings, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business and consolidated financial position and
    on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness.

We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our
    shareholders’ equity. As of January 3, 2009, we had
    total debt of approximately $5.46 billion and
    shareholders’ equity of $1.45 billion.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences,
    including:

•

impairing the ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures or general



corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our
    debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward. A
    downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly our short-term
    credit rating, would likely reduce the amount of commercial
    paper we could issue, increase our commercial paper borrowing
    costs, or both;

•

restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market
    conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a
    general downturn in economic conditions or our business;

•

requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations
    to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our
    debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes such
    as expansion through acquisitions, marketing spending and
    expansion of our product offerings; and

•

causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors,
    which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our
    obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our
    financial and operating performance, which in turn, is subject
    to prevailing economic conditions, the availability of, and
    interest rates on, short-term financing, and financial, business
    and other factors beyond our control.

Our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a
    result of increases in the price of raw materials, including
    agricultural commodities, fuel and labor.

Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, soybean oil,
    sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our
    products. Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal
    packaging materials used by us. The cost of such commodities may
    fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation,
    weather conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. To the
    extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of
    such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or
    adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that
    offsets such changes, the results of our operations could be
    materially and adversely affected. In addition, we use
    derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted
    purchases of raw materials. Our hedged price could exceed the
    spot price on the date of purchase, resulting in an unfavorable
    impact on both gross margin and net earnings.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international
    facilities are regularly fuelled by natural gas or propane,
    which are obtained from local utilities or other local
    suppliers. Short-term stand-by propane storage exists at several
    plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies.
    Oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various
    plants. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are
    used in connection with the distribution of our products. The
    cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political
    conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other
    unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated operating results or financial
    condition.

A shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary
    pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could
    increase labor cost, which could have a material adverse effect
    on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.

Additionally, our labor costs include the cost of providing
    benefits for employees. We sponsor a number of defined benefit
    plans for employees in the United States and various foreign
    locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active
    health care, severance and other postemployment benefits. We
    also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for
    certain of our manufacturing locations. Our major pension plans
    and U.S. retiree health and welfare plans are funded with
    trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of
    equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate
    and other investments. The annual cost of benefits can vary
    significantly from year to year and is materially affected by
    such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return
    on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount
    rate used to measure obligations, the rate or trend of health
    care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained
    wage and benefit agreements.

Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our ability, including manufacturing or distribution
    capabilities, and that of our suppliers, business partners and
    contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is
    critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their
    manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather,
    natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics,
    strikes or other reasons, could impair our ability to
    manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps
    to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,
    or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could
    adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
    of operations, as well as require additional resources to
    restore our supply chain.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face
    of a consolidating retail environment. In addition, the loss of
    one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales
    and profits.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated net sales during
    2008, comprised principally of sales within the United States.
    At January 3, 2009, approximately 17% of our



consolidated receivables balance and 27% of our
    U.S. receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by
    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates. No other customer
    accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2008. During
    2008, our top five customers, collectively, including Wal-Mart,
    accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales
    and approximately 42% of U.S. net sales. As the retail
    grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become
    larger, our large retail customers may seek to use their
    position to improve their profitability through improved
    efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If
    we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product
    innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our
    profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. The
    loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could
    negatively impact our sales and profits.

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any
    inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products
    and brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and
    most notably our trademarks, but also including patents, trade
    secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be a
    significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to
    protect our intellectual property rights through a combination
    of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well
    as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure and
    assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our
    intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately
    protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products,
    or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that
    serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our
    intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and
    could materially harm our business.

We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that
    may cover some of our technology, brands or products. Any
    litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property
    could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the
    attention of our management and key personnel from our business
    operations. Third party claims of intellectual property
    infringement might also require us to enter into costly license
    agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or
    injunctions against development and sale of certain products.

Our operations face significant foreign currency exchange
    rate exposure which could negatively impact our operating
    results.

We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay
    expenses in a variety of currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar, including the British pound, euro, Australian
    dollar, Canadian dollar, Venezuelan bolivar fuerte, Russian
    rouble and Mexican peso. Because our consolidated financial
    statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate
    our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into
    U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates.
    Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the
    U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items
    in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value
    has not changed in their original currency.

Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure
    to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations
    and laws could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial condition.

Our activities, both in and outside of the United States, are
    subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and
    local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Federal Trade
    Commission, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce
    and Labor, as well as similar and other authorities of the
    European Union and various state, provincial and local
    governments, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies.
    Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities.

The manufacturing, marketing and distribution of food products
    are subject to governmental regulation that is becoming
    increasingly burdensome. Those regulations control such matters
    as food quality and safety, ingredients, advertising, relations
    with distributors and retailers, health and safety and the
    environment. We are also regulated with respect to matters such
    as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, tax and
    environmental matters. The need to comply with new or revised
    tax, environmental, food quality and safety or other laws or
    regulations, or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of
    existing laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect
    on our business and results of operations. Further, if we are
    found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and
    regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil
    remedies, including fines, injunctions, or recalls, as well as
    potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business.

Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could
    cause consumers to avoid certain food products or
    ingredients.

We could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in
    the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients,
    or the food safety system generally. Adverse publicity about
    these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage
    consumers from buying our products or cause production and
    delivery disruptions.

If our food products become adulterated or misbranded, we
    might need to recall those items and may experience product
    liability if consumers are injured as a result.

Selling food products involves a number of legal and other
    risks, including product contamination, spoilage,



product tampering or other adulteration. We may need to recall
    some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded.
    We may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products
    causes injury, illness or death. A widespread product recall or
    market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to
    their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost
    sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time.
    For example, in January 2009, we initiated a recall of certain

Austin

and

Keebler

branded peanut butter sandwich
    crackers and certain

Famous Amos

and

Keebler

branded peanut butter cookies as a result of potential
    contamination of ingredients at a supplier’s facility. The
    recall was expanded in late January and February to include

Bear Naked

,

Kashi

and

Special K

products
    impacted by that same supplier’s ingredients. The costs of
    the recall negatively impacted gross margin and operating profit
    in fiscal 2008. We could also suffer losses from a significant
    product liability judgment against us. A significant product
    recall or product liability case could also result in adverse
    publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer
    confidence in our food products, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business results and the value of our
    brands. Moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud
    claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not pursued, the
    negative publicity surrounding assertions against our Company
    and our products or processes could adversely affect our
    reputation or brands.

Technology failures could disrupt our operations and
    negatively impact our business.

We increasingly rely on information technology systems to
    process, transmit, and store electronic information. For
    example, our production and distribution facilities and
    inventory management utilize information technology to increase
    efficiencies and limit costs. Furthermore, a significant portion
    of the communications between our personnel, customers, and
    suppliers depends on information technology. Like other
    companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable
    to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control,
    including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist
    attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers,
    and other security issues. We have technology security
    initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place or in process
    to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities, but these
    measures may not be adequate.

If we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint
    ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate
    favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired
    businesses.

From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions,
    divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic
    objectives. With respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to
    identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms
    that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns and other
    benefits as a result of integration challenges. With respect to
    proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter
    difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies
    on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the
    accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divesture
    activities may require us to recognize impairment charges.
    Companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may
    not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and
    profitability that justify the investments made. Our corporate
    development activities may present financial and operational
    risks, including diversion of management attention from existing
    core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and
    financial and other systems, and adverse effects on existing
    business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future
    acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances
    of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent
    liabilities

and/or

amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and
    increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our
    results of operations and financial condition.

Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our
    products.

Retailers are increasingly offering private label products that
    compete with our products. Consumers’ willingness to
    purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer
    products that appeal to consumers at the right price. It is also
    important that our products are perceived to be of a higher
    quality than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in
    quality between our products and those of store brands narrows,
    or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed,
    then consumers may not buy our products. Furthermore, during
    periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more
    private label or other economy brands, which could reduce sales
    volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift
    in our product mix to our lower margin offerings. If we are not
    able to maintain or improve our brand image, it could have a
    material affect on our market share and our profitability.

    STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters and principal research and
    development facilities are located in Battle Creek, Michigan.

We operated, as of February 23, 2009, manufacturing plants
    and distribution and warehousing facilities totaling more than
    29 million square feet of building area in the United
    States and other countries. Our plants have been designed and
    constructed to meet our specific production requirements, and we
    periodically invest money for capital and technological



improvements. At the time of its selection, each location was
    considered to be favorable, based on the location of markets,
    sources of raw materials, availability of suitable labor,
    transportation facilities, location of our other plants
    producing similar products, and other factors. Our manufacturing
    facilities in the United States include four cereal plants and
    warehouses located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster,
    Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska and other
    plants in San Jose, California; Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus,
    and Rome, Georgia; Chicago and Gardner, Illinois; Seelyville,
    Indiana, Kansas City, Kansas; Florence, Louisville, and
    Pikeville, Kentucky; Grand Rapids and Wyoming, Michigan; Blue
    Anchor, New Jersey; Cary and Charlotte, North Carolina;
    Cincinnati, Fremont, and Zanesville, Ohio; Muncy, Pennsylvania;
    Rossville, Tennessee; Clearfield, Utah; and Allyn, Washington.

Outside the United States, we had, as of February 23, 2009,
    additional manufacturing locations, some with warehousing
    facilities, in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia,
    Ecuador, Germany, Great Britain, Guatemala, India, Japan,
    Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and
    Venezuela.

We generally own our principal properties, including our major
    office facilities, although some manufacturing facilities are
    leased, and no owned property is subject to any major lien or
    other encumbrance. Distribution facilities (including related
    warehousing facilities) and offices of non-plant locations
    typically are leased. In general, we consider our facilities,
    taken as a whole, to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient
    capacity for our current operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising
    out of our business which cover matters such as general
    commercial, governmental regulations, antitrust and trade
    regulations, product liability, intellectual property,
    employment and other actions. In the opinion of management, the
    ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position or results of
    operations.

PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET
    FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER
    MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Information on the market for our common stock, number of
    shareowners and dividends is located in Note 16 within
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are
    included herein under Part II, Item 8.

During the quarter ended January 3, 2009, the Company did
    not acquire any shares of its common stock. During this period,
    $500 million was the approximate dollar value of shares
    that may have been purchased under existing plans or programs.

On July 25, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of $500 million of Kellogg common stock during
    2008 and 2009 for general corporate purposes and to offset
    issuances for employee benefit programs. No purchases were made
    under this program. The authorization for this program was
    canceled on February 4, 2009 and replaced with a
    $650 million authorization for 2009.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader
    understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present
    business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to,
    and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto
    contained in Item 8 of this report.

Kellogg Company is the world’s leading producer of cereal
    and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies,
    crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen
    waffles, and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and
    marketed globally. We currently manage our operations in four
    geographic operating segments, comprised of North America and
    the three International operating segments of Europe, Latin
    America, and Asia Pacific. Beginning in 2007, the Asia Pacific
    segment includes South Africa, which was formerly a part of
    Europe. Prior years were restated for comparison purposes.

We manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our
    long-term annual growth targets. These targets are low
    single-digit (1 to 3%) for internal net sales, mid single-digit
    (4 to 6%) for internal operating profit, and high single-digit
    (7 to 9%) for net earnings per share on a currency neutral
    basis. See “Foreign currency translation” section on
    page 15 for an explanation of the Company’s definition of
    currency neutral.

For our full year 2008, we exceeded our net sales target with
    reported net sales growth of 9%, and internal growth of 5.4%.
    Consolidated operating profit increased 4.5%, on internal growth
    of 4.2%, in line with our target. Reported diluted earnings per
    share grew 8%, within our target, to $2.99 per share, while
    currency neutral EPS grew 10%.

In combination with an attractive dividend yield, we believe
    this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong
    total return to our shareholders. We believe we can achieve this
    sustainable growth through a strategy focused on growing our
    cereal business, expanding our snacks business, and pursuing
    selected growth opportunities. We support our business strategy
    with operating principles that emphasize profit-rich,
    sustainable sales growth

,

as well as cash flow and return
    on invested capital. We believe our steady earnings growth,
    strong cash flow, and continued investment during a multi-year
    period of significant commodity and energy-driven cost inflation
    demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model.

During 2008, our consolidated net sales increased almost 9%
    driven by our North America business with increases in both
    volume and price/mix for the year. Internal net sales grew over
    5%, building on a 5% rate of internal growth during 2007. We had
    a fifty-third week in our 2008 fiscal year which contributed
    almost 2% to our reported growth over the prior year as did our
    acquisitions. For further information on our acquisitions refer
    to Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    beginning on page 35. Management has estimated the pro
    forma effect on the Company’s results of operations as
    though these business combinations had been completed at the
    beginning of either 2008 or 2007 would have been immaterial.
    Successful innovation, brand-building (advertising and consumer
    promotion) investment as well as our recent price increases
    continued to drive growth. Declines in volume in both Europe and
    Latin America were more than offset by growth in pricing/mix due
    to our price increases. Asia Pacific had a particularly strong
    year experiencing growth of 8% driven by cereal sales across the
    operating segment.

For 2008, our North America operating segment reported a net
    sales increase of almost 9% with internal net sales growth of
    6%. The growth was broad based and driven by our price
    realization and strong innovation. The major product brands grew
    as follows: retail cereal +3%; retail snacks (cookies, crackers,
    toaster pastries, cereal bars, and fruit snacks) +6%; frozen and
    specialty channels (frozen foods, food service and vending) +9%.
    While retail cereal grew 3% for the year, we had a relatively
    soft share performance in the fourth quarter facing aggressive
    price-based incentives from our competitors. In addition, while
    we estimate our consumption was up 2% across all channels,
    reductions in trade inventory also adversely affected shipments.
    As a result, our fourth quarter internal net sales declined by
    3% which was up against a tough comparable of 8% growth in the
    prior year. Our snacks business grew 6% in 2008 on top of 7%
    growth last year. Our growth came from volume, price increases,
    and successful innovations such as

Townhouse Flipsides

and

Cheez-It Duoz

. We saw net sales growth in all
    product categories — toaster pastries, crackers,
    cookies and wholesome snacks. Our “Right Bites” 100
    calorie cookie and cracker packs performed well as we saw an
    increase in demand for portion controlled portable food. Our
    specialty and frozen channels grew over 9%. Our food service
    business performed well, achieving mid single-digit growth for
    the year. Frozen realized strong sales driven by innovations
    such as

Bake Shop Swirlz

,

Mini Muffin Tops

and

French Toast Waffles

.

Our International operating segments collectively achieved net
    sales growth of 9%, or 5% on an internal basis. Europe’s
    internal net sales grew by almost 4% attributable to price/mix,
    as volume was down slightly. The UK and continental Europe have
    been impacted by the economic crisis which has consumers
    searching for value and retailers reducing inventory. Snacks
    products are performing well across the region, especially in
    the UK driven by

Rice Krispies Squares

. Latin
    America’s internal net sales growth was 4% attributable to
    our price increases and driven by cereal sales in Mexico and
    Venezuela. This year’s growth is on top of last year’s
    9% growth. Volume was down for the year due to the economic
    environment which is impacting consumer confidence. Asia Pacific
    had a very strong year with 8% internal net sales growth. The
    growth was volume driven and broad based in both retail cereal
    and retail snacks.

Consolidated operating profit grew by almost 5% on an as
    reported basis and 4% on an internal basis. Operating profit in
    all areas was impacted by significant cost pressures as
    discussed in more detail in the “Margin performance”
    section beginning on page 14. North America grew by 6%
    driven by growth in net sales and lower exit costs which offset
    higher



commodity costs. Costs associated with the peanut-related recall
    of Kellogg products adversely impacted North America’s
    operating profit by $34 million or 2% of the full year
    operating profit. See the “Subsequent event” section
    on page 18 for more details. Operating profit declined
    slightly in both Europe and Latin America due to increased
    commodity costs and cost reduction initiatives. Asia
    Pacific’s operating profit increased 11% on an internal
    basis due to strong top line growth. On a consolidated basis,
    operating profit from acquisitions decreased internal operating
    profit by 1%, in line with our expectations, with Europe and
    Asia Pacific being particularly impacted by our Russian and
    Chinese acquisitions, respectively.

We measure the volume impact
    (tonnage) on revenues based on the stated weight of our product
    shipments.

During 2007, our consolidated net sales increased 8% on strong
    results from broad based growth across our operating segments.
    Internal net sales grew over 5%, building on a 7% rate of
    internal growth during 2006. Successful innovation,
    brand-building (advertising and consumer promotion) investment
    and in-store execution continued to drive broad based sales
    growth across each of our enterprise-wide product groups. In
    fact, we achieved growth in retail cereal sales within each of
    our operating segments.

For 2007, our North America operating segment reported a net
    sales increase of 6%. Internal net sales grew over 5%, with each
    major product group contributing as follows: retail cereal +3%;
    retail snacks (cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars,
    fruit snacks) +7%; frozen and specialty (food service, club
    stores, vending, convenience, drug and value stores) channels
    +6%. The significant growth achieved by our North America snacks
    business built on internal growth of +11% in 2006.

Our International operating segments collectively achieved net
    sales growth of approximately 12% or 5% on an internal basis,
    with leading dollar contributions from our businesses in the UK,
    France, Mexico, and Venezuela. Internal sales of our Asia
    Pacific operating segment (which represents approximately 5% of
    our consolidated results) were approximately even with the prior
    year, as solid growth in Asian markets was offset by weak
    performance in our Australian business.

Consolidated operating profit for 2007 grew 6%, with internal
    operating profit up 3% versus 2006. For 2007, Europe contributed
    a strong 14% internal growth rate, driven by increased sales and
    stronger gross margins, as well as lower up-front costs. Despite
    a strong sales performance, operating profit in our North
    American segment was dampened by continued commodity cost
    pressures and significantly higher up-front costs associated
    with cost reduction initiatives as more fully discussed on
    page 16. Our Latin America and Asia Pacific operating
    segments suffered operating profit declines, primarily driven by
    lower gross margins due to increased commodity costs, as well as
    the previously mentioned weak performance in our Australian
    business.

We strive for gross profit dollar growth to reinvest in
    brand-building and innovation. Our strategy for increasing our
    gross profit is to manage external cost pressures through
    product pricing and mix improvements, productivity savings, and
    technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product
    ingredients and packaging. For 2008, our gross profit was up
    $188 million over 2007, an increase of 4%. Our gross profit
    would have increased by an additional $5 million excluding
    the impact of foreign currency.

Our decline in gross margin for 2007 and 2008 reflects the
    impact of significant cost pressure with higher costs for
    commodities, energy, and fuel being partially offset by the
    impact of cost reduction initiatives and increased



pricing. For 2008, these cost pressures represented 10% of
    2007’s cost of goods sold, primarily associated with our
    ingredient purchases. In 2007, these cost pressures represented
    6% of the prior year’s cost of goods sold. In 2008,
    acquisitions negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points.

For 2009, we expect inflationary trends to continue although we
    plan to offset the expected 4% to 5% of cost pressures by
    savings from cost reduction initiatives of up to 4% to keep the
    gross margin percentage approximately flat year over year.

For 2008, our SGA% decreased over the prior year due to our
    strong net sales growth, lower expense related to cost reduction
    initiatives recorded in SGA, continued discipline in overhead
    spending and efficiencies in advertising and promotion. For
    2007, our SGA% was negatively impacted by the reorganization of
    our direct store-door delivery (DSD) operations. Total program
    costs of $77 million were recorded in SGA expense, as
    discussed further in the “Exit or disposal activities”
    section.

Foreign
    currency translation

The reporting currency for our financial statements is the
    U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses
    and revenues, are denominated in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, British pound, Mexican
    peso, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. To prepare our
    consolidated financial statements, we must translate those
    assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into
    U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result,
    increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar
    against these other currencies will affect the amount of these
    items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their
    value has not changed in their original currency. This could
    have significant impact on our results if such increase or
    decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial.

The recent volatility in the foreign exchange markets has
    limited our ability to forecast future U.S. reported
    earnings. As such, we are measuring diluted earnings per share
    growth and providing guidance on future earnings on a currency
    neutral basis, assuming earnings are translated at the prior
    year’s exchange rates. This non-GAAP financial measure is
    being used to focus management and investors on local currency
    business results, thereby providing visibility to the underlying
    trends of the Company. Management believes that excluding the
    impact of foreign currency from EPS provides a better
    measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign
    exchange markets.

Below is a reconciliation of reported diluted EPS to currency
    neutral EPS for the fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006:

(b)

The growth percentage for 2006 has
    been adjusted for the impact of our adoption of SFAS
    No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment,” which reduced
    our fiscal 2006 operating profit by $65 million
    ($42 million after tax or $.11 per share), due
    primarily to recognition of compensation expense associated with
    employee and director stock option grants. Correspondingly, our
    reported operating profit and net earnings growth for 2006 was
    reduced by approximately 4% and diluted net earnings per share
    growth was reduced by approximately 5%.

Exit
    or disposal activities

We view our continued spending on cost-reduction initiatives as
    part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater
    visibility in achieving our long-term profit growth targets.
    Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash
    implementation costs within a five-year period of completion.
    Each cost-reduction initiative is normally up to three years in
    duration. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed
    in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to
    deliver cash savings

and/or

reduced depreciation. Certain of these initiatives represent
    exit or disposal activities for which material charges have been
    incurred. We include these charges in our measure of operating
    segment profitability.

Cost
    summary

For 2008 we recorded $27 million of costs associated with
    exit or disposal activities comprised of $7 million of
    asset write offs, $17 million of severance and other cash
    costs and $3 million related to pension costs.
    $23 million of the 2008 charges were recorded in cost of
    goods sold within the Europe operating segment, with the balance
    recorded in SGA expense in the Latin America operating segment.

For 2007, we recorded charges of $100 million, comprised of
    $7 million of asset write-offs, $72 million for
    severance and other exit costs including route franchise
    settlements, $15 million for other cash expenditures, and
    $6 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal
    liability. $23 million of the total 2007 charges were
    recorded in cost of goods sold within the Europe operating
    segment results, with $77 million recorded in SGA expense
    within the North America operating results.

For 2006, we recorded charges of $82 million, comprised of
    $20 million of asset write-offs, $30 million for
    severance and other exit costs, $9 million for other cash
    expenditures, $4 million for a



multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability, and
    $19 million for pension and other postretirement plan
    curtailment losses and special termination benefits.
    $74 million was recorded in cost of goods sold within
    operating segment results and $8 million in SGA expense
    within corporate results. The Company’s operating segments
    were impacted as follows (in millions): North America-$46;
    Europe–$28.

Exit cost reserves at January 3, 2009 were $2 million
    related to severance payments. Exit cost reserves were
    $5 million at December 29, 2007, consisting of
    $2 million for severance and $3 million for lease
    termination payments.

Specific
    initiatives

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we executed a cost-reduction
    initiative in Latin America that resulted in the elimination of
    approximately 120 salaried positions. The cost of the
    program was $4 million and was recorded in Latin
    America’s SGA expense. The charge related primarily to
    severance benefits which were paid by the end of the year. There
    were no reserves as of January 3, 2009 related to this
    program.

We commenced a multi-year European manufacturing optimization
    plan in 2006 to improve utilization of our facility in
    Manchester, England and to better align production in Europe.
    The project resulted in an elimination of approximately
    220 hourly and salaried positions from our Manchester
    facility through voluntary early retirement and severance
    programs. The pension trust funding requirements of these early
    retirements exceeded the recognized benefit expense by
    $5 million which was funded in 2006. During this program
    certain manufacturing equipment was removed from service.

All of the costs for the European manufacturing optimization
    plan have been recorded in cost of goods sold within our Europe
    operating segment. The following tables present total project
    costs and a reconciliation of employee severance reserves for
    this initiative. All other cash costs were paid in the period
    incurred. The project was completed in 2008.

In October 2007, we committed to reorganize certain production
    processes at our plants in Valls, Spain and Bremen, Germany.
    Commencement of this plan followed consultation with union
    representatives at the Bremen facility regarding the elimination
    of approximately 120 employee positions. This
    reorganization plan improved manufacturing and distribution
    efficiency across the Company’s continental European
    operations, and has been completed as of the end of the
    Company’s 2008 fiscal year.

All of the costs for European production process realignment
    have been recorded in cost of goods sold within our Europe
    operating segment.

In July 2007, we began a plan to reorganize our direct
    store-door delivery (DSD) operations in the southeastern United
    States. This DSD reorganization plan was intended to integrate
    our southeastern sales and distribution regions with the rest of
    our U.S. DSD operations, resulting in greater efficiency
    across the nationwide network. We exited approximately 517
    distribution route franchise agreements with independent
    contractors. The plan also resulted in the involuntary
    termination or relocation of approximately 300 employee
    positions. Total project costs incurred were $77 million,
    principally consisting of cash expenditures for route franchise
    settlements and to a lesser extent, for employee separation,
    relocation, and reorganization. Exit reserves were
    $3 million at December 29, 2007 and were paid in 2008.
    All of the costs for the U.S. DSD reorganization plan have
    been recorded in SGA expense within our North America operating
    segment. This initiative is complete.

During 2006, we commenced several initiatives to enhance the
    productivity and efficiency of our



U.S. cereal manufacturing network, primarily through
    technological and sourcing improvements in warehousing and
    packaging operations. In conjunction with these initiatives, we
    offered voluntary separation incentives, which resulted in the
    retirement of approximately 80 hourly employees by early
    2007. During 2006, we incurred approximately $15 million of
    total up-front costs, comprised of approximately 20% asset
    write-offs and 80% cash costs, including $10 million of
    pension and other postretirement plan curtailment losses. These
    initiatives were complete by the end of 2007.

Also during 2006, we undertook an initiative to improve customer
    focus and selling efficiency within a particular Latin American
    market, leading to a shift from a third-party distributor to a
    direct sales force model. As a result of this initiative, we
    paid $8 million in cash during 2006 to exit the existing
    distribution arrangement.

During 2008 we finalized our pension plan withdrawal liability
    related to our North America snacks bakery consolidation which
    was executed in 2005 and 2006. The final liability was
    $20 million, $16 million of which was recognized in
    2005 and $4 million in 2006; and was paid in the third
    quarter of 2008.

Other
    2008 cost reduction initiatives

In addition to investments in exit or disposal activities, we
    undertook various other cost reduction initiatives during 2008.

We incurred $10 million of expense in connection with a
    payment for the restructuring of our labor force at a
    manufacturing facility in Mexico. This cost was recorded in cost
    of goods sold in the Latin America operating segment.

We also incurred $17 million of expense for the elimination
    of the accelerated ownership feature of certain employee stock
    options. Refer to Note 8 within Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information. This expense was
    recorded in SGA expense within corporate results.

During 2008, we also began a lean manufacturing initiative in
    certain U.S., Latin American and European manufacturing
    facilities. We are referring to this initiative as K LEAN which
    stands for Kellogg’s lean, efficient, agile network. This
    program will ensure we are optimizing our manufacturing network,
    reducing waste, developing best practices across our global
    facilities and reducing future capital expenditures. We incurred
    costs of $12 million for consulting recorded in cost of
    goods sold primarily within our North America operating segment.
    The total cost and cash outlay for this program is estimated to
    be $65 million. This project is expected to be primarily
    complete by the end of 2009.

Interest
    expense

As illustrated in the following table, annual interest expense
    for the

2006-2008

period has been relatively steady, which reflects a stable
    effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant
    debt balance throughout most of that time. Interest income
    (recorded in other income (expense), net) increased from
    approximately $11 million in 2006 to $20 million in
    2008, resulting in net interest expense of approximately
    $288 million for 2008. We currently expect that our
    2009 gross interest expense will be approximately
    $280 million.

    Company Owned Life Insurance (“COLI”), due to changes
    in cash surrender value, were (in millions): 2008–$(12);
    2007–$9; 2006–$12.

Income
    taxes

Our long-term objective is to achieve a consolidated effective
    income tax rate of approximately 30% in comparison to a
    U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. We pursue
    planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our
    target. Excluding the impact of discrete adjustments and the
    cost of repatriating foreign earnings, our sustainable
    consolidated effective income tax rate for 2008 was 31% and was
    32% for both 2007 and 2006. We currently expect our 2009
    sustainable rate to be approximately 31%. Our reported rates of
    29.7% for 2008 and 28.7% for 2007 were lower than the
    sustainable rate due to the



favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit
    settlements, international restructuring initiatives and
    statutory rate changes. (Refer to Note 11 within Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) For
    2009, we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be
    approximately 30% to 31%. This could be impacted if pending
    uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be
    affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less
    favorably than we currently expect. Fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates could also impact the effective tax rate
    as it is dependent upon the U.S. dollar earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing
    statutory tax rates.

Subsequent
    event

On January 14, 2009, we announced a precautionary hold on
    certain

Austin

and

Keebler

branded peanut butter
    sandwich crackers and certain

Famous Amos

and

Keebler

branded peanut butter cookies while the U.S. Food and
    Drug Administration and other authorities investigated Peanut
    Corporation of America (“PCA”), one of Kellogg’s
    peanut paste suppliers for the cracker and cookie products. On
    January 16, 2009, Kellogg voluntarily recalled those
    products because the paste ingredients supplied to Kellogg had
    the potential to be contaminated with salmonella. The recall was
    expanded on January 31, February 2 and February 17, 2009 to
    include certain

Bear Naked

,

Kashi

and

Special K

products impacted by PCA ingredients.

We have incurred costs associated with the recalls and in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP we recorded certain items
    associated with this subsequent event in our fiscal year 2008
    financial results.

The charges associated with the recalls reduced North America
    full-year 2008 operating profit by $34 million or $0.06 of
    EPS. We expect a similar impact in 2009. Of the total 2008
    charges, $12 million related to estimated customer returns
    and consumer rebates and was recorded as a reduction to net
    sales; $21 million related to costs associated with
    returned product and the disposal and write-off of inventory
    which was recorded as cost of goods sold; and $1 million
    related to other costs which were recorded as SGA expense.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows
    supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other
    significant transactions. Our cash-generating capability is one
    of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial
    financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.

Credit
    environment

The U.S. and global economies began a period of uncertainty
    starting in 2007. Financial markets continue to experience
    unprecedented volatility. Beginning in the third quarter of 2008
    and thereafter, global capital and credit markets, including
    commercial paper markets, experienced increased instability and
    disruption.

Our Company’s financial strength was evident throughout
    this period of uncertainty, as we continued to have access to
    the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper markets. Although
    interest rates on our U.S. commercial paper increased by an
    average of 200 basis points during the period from
    mid-September through October 2008, the average interest rate we
    paid for commercial paper borrowings in 2008 declined to 3.5%
    from an average of 5.4% in 2007. Our commercial paper and term
    debt credit ratings have not been affected by the changes in the
    credit environment, and the amount of our total debt outstanding
    remained relatively flat over the past three years.

If needed, we have additional sources of liquidity available to
    us. These sources include our access to public debt

and/or

equity markets, and the ability to sell trade receivables. Our
    Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in 2011, allows us to
    borrow up to $2.0 billion on a revolving credit basis. This
    source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured
    basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.

We monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial
    institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash
    equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our
    credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and
    other arrangements.

We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our
    credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be
    adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in
    the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that
    continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global
    capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access
    these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

Operating
    activities

The principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings,
    meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of
    costs to manufacture and market our products. Our cash
    conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory and trade
    receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding,
    based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short,
    equating to approximately 22 days for 2008, 24 days
    for 2007 and 26 days for 2006. The decrease in 2008 was the
    result of a decrease in days of inventory outstanding, while the
    decrease in 2007 reflected an increase in days of trade payables
    outstanding.

Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 was
    $236 million lower than 2007, due primarily to a
    substantial increase in pension and other postretirement benefit
    plan contributions in 2008 and an unfavorable year-over-year
    variance in other working capital. Partially offsetting the
    decrease was the impact of changes in deferred income taxes and
    a favorable variance in core working capital.

Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 was
    $93 million higher than the comparable period of 2006, due
    primarily to growth in cash-basis earnings and favorable total
    working capital performance. As compared to 2006, the favorable
    movement in core working capital during 2007 was related
    principally to higher accounts payable, which were due in part
    to increased payment terms in international locations.

In 2008, core working capital was an average of 6.2% of net
    sales, an improvement of 0.6% compared with 2007. In 2007, core
    working capital was an average of 6.8% of net sales, consistent
    with 2006. We manage core working capital through timely
    collection of accounts receivable, extending terms on accounts
    payable and careful monitoring of inventory.

Other working capital in 2008 reflected an increase in cash paid
    associated with hedging programs, cash paid for advertising and
    promotion, and the impact of changes in accrued salaries and
    wages. Other working capital in 2007 was a use of cash versus a
    source of cash in 2006. The difference related to a
    year-over-year increase in the amount of income tax payments.

Recent adverse conditions in the equity markets caused the
    actual rate of return on our pension and postretirement plan
    assets to be significantly below our assumed long-term rate of
    return of 8.9%. As a result, we decided to make additional
    contributions to our pension and postretirement plans amounting
    to $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our total
    pension and postretirement plan funding for 2008 totaled
    $451 million, while funding in 2007 and 2006 amounted to
    $96 million and $99 million, respectively.

In 2006, the Pension Protection Act (PPA) became law in the
    United States. The PPA revised the basis and methodology for
    determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as
    well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from
    tax-qualified plans. The PPA will ultimately require us to make
    additional contributions to our U.S. plans. We believe that
    we will not be required to make any contributions under PPA
    requirements until 2011. Our projections concerning timing of
    PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based
    on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance
    and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions
    of the PPA.

We currently project that we will make total U.S. and
    foreign plan contributions in 2009 of approximately
    $100 million. Actual 2009 contributions could be different
    from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to
    undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus
    other competing investment priorities, future changes in
    government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of
    union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost
    experience.

Our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash
    provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for
    property additions. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of
    cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of
    cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions,
    acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our cash flow
    metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as
    follows:

Our 2008 cash flow (as defined) reflects the impact of the
    additional pension contributions we made in the fourth quarter
    of 2008. For 2009, we are expecting cash flow (as defined) in
    the range of $1,050 million to $1,150 million. This
    projection assumes an adverse impact on 2009 cash flow of
    approximately $100 million associated with changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates. We expect to achieve our target
    principally through operating profit growth, lower contributions
    to pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2009, and
    continued prudent management of our working capital.



Investing
    activities

Our net cash used in investing activities for 2008 amounted to
    $681 million, an increase of $80 million compared with
    2007. Net cash used in investing activities of $601 million
    in 2007 increased by $156 million compared with 2006.

Cash paid for acquisitions during 2008 and 2007 were the primary
    drivers of increases in cash used in investing activities, as we
    expanded our platform for future growth with acquisitions in
    Russia, China, the U.S. and Australia. Acquisitions are
    discussed in Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net
    sales amounted to 3.6% in 2008, 4.0% in 2007 and 4.2% in 2006.
    In 2008, capital spending consisted primarily of construction
    costs to increase capacity in Europe and to expand our global
    research center in Battle Creek, Michigan. In 2007, we made
    capacity expansions to accommodate sales growth, including the
    purchase of a previously leased snacks manufacturing facility in
    Chicago, Illinois.

We expect our K LEAN manufacturing efficiency initiative to
    result in a trend toward lower capital spending. Going forward,
    our long-term target for capital spending is between 3.0% and
    4.0% of net sales.

Our 2009 capital plan includes spending for a new facility to
    manufacture ready-to-eat cereal in Mexico and continued spending
    on the ongoing project to expand the global research center in
    Battle Creek, Michigan. The expansion of the W. K. Kellogg
    Institute for Food and Nutrition Research reflects our
    commitment to research and innovation which is a key driver to
    the growth of our business.

Financing
    activities

Our net cash used in financing activities for 2008, 2007 and
    2006 amounted to $780 million, $788 million and
    $789 million, respectively.

In March 2008, we issued $750 million of five-year 4.25%
    fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes under an existing shelf
    registration statement. We used proceeds of $746 million
    from issuance of this long-term debt to retire a portion of our
    commercial paper. In conjunction with this debt issuance, we
    entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling
    $750 million, which effectively converted this debt from a
    fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the duration of the
    five-year term. In 2008, we had cash outflows of
    $465 million in connection with the repayment of five-year
    U.S. Dollar Notes at maturity in June 2008. That debt had
    an effective interest rate of 3.35%.

In January 2007, we increased our available credit via a
    $400 million unsecured

364-Day

Credit Agreement. The $400 million Credit Agreement expired
    in January 2008 and we decided not to renew it. In February
    2007, we redeemed Euro Notes for $728 million. To partially
    finance this redemption, we established a program to issue euro
    commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount
    outstanding at any time of $750 million or its equivalent
    in alternative currencies. In December 2007, the Company issued
    $750 million of five-year 5.125% fixed rate
    U.S. Dollar Notes under the existing shelf registration
    statement, using the proceeds to replace a portion of our
    U.S. commercial paper.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we repurchased $650 million of
    our common stock each year under programs authorized by our
    Board of Directors. The number of shares repurchased amounted to
    approximately 13 million, 12 million and
    15 million shares, respectively, in 2008, 2007 and 2006.
    The 2006 activity consisted principally of a private transaction
    with the W. K. Kellogg Foundation Trust to repurchase
    approximately 13 million shares for $550 million. On
    February 4, 2009, the Board of Directors authorized a
    $650 million share repurchase authorization for 2009 that
    we plan to execute largely in the second half of the year. The
    Board also canceled a $500 million share repurchase
    authorization that it had authorized in third quarter 2008. We
    made no purchases under the $500 million share repurchase
    authorization because of our decision to use cash to fund
    pension plans and reduce commercial paper in the fourth quarter
    of 2008.

We paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.30 per
    share in 2008, $1.202 per share in 2007 and $1.137 per share in
    2006. Cash paid for dividends increased by 8.2% in 2008, and by
    5.7% in 2007. Our objective is to maintain our dividend pay-out
    ratio between 40% and 50% of reported net earnings.

At January 3, 2009, our total debt was $5.5 billion,
    approximately level with the balance at year-end 2007. Our
    long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit
    the Company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain
    liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back
    transactions. Some agreements also contain change in control
    provisions. However, they do not contain acceleration of
    maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change
    in the Company’s credit ratings could limit our access to
    the U.S. short-term debt market

and/or

increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future.
    However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to
    have access to our aforementioned credit facilities.

We continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest
    and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt
    covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our
    operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt-on
    acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash
    flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit
    facilities on a global basis.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    ESTIMATES

Promotional
    expenditures

Our promotional activities are conducted either through the
    retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities
    such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts,
    consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. The costs of
    these activities are generally recognized at the time the
    related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual
    cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore
    requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional
    offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or
    consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques
    including historical data on performance of similar promotional
    programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual
    redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a
    change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a
    full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments have rarely
    represented more than 0.3% of our Company’s net sales.
    However, our Company’s total promotional expenditures
    (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction)
    represented approximately 40% of 2008 net sales; therefore,
    it is likely that our results would be materially different if
    different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets

We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” in evaluating impairment of
    intangibles. We perform this evaluation at least annually during
    the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual
    budgeting process. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill
    impairment testing first requires a comparison between the
    carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with
    associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and
    liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting
    unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate
    items among reporting units. The fair value of a reporting unit
    is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples
    likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction.
    Similarly, impairment testing of other intangible assets
    requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that
    particular asset. Fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets
    are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be
    generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a
    particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty
    stream attributable to branded product sales. These estimates
    are made using various inputs including historical data, current
    and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market
    comparables.

We also apply the principles of SFAS No. 142 in
    evaluating the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible
    asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the
    cash flows of the Company. An intangible asset with a finite
    useful life is amortized; an intangible asset with an indefinite
    useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated annually for
    impairment. Reaching a determination on useful life requires
    significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future
    effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic
    factors (such as the stability of the industry, known
    technological advances, legislative action that results in an
    uncertain or changing



regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution
    channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and
    the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

At January 3, 2009, goodwill and other intangible assets
    amounted to $5.1 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill
    and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler
    Foods Company. Within this total, approximately
    $1.4 billion of non-goodwilll intangible assets were
    classified as indefinite-lived, comprised principally of Keebler
    trademarks. We currently believe that the fair value of our
    goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying
    value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute
    indefinitely to the cash flows of the Company. However, if we
    had used materially different assumptions regarding the future
    performance of our North American snacks business or a different
    weighted-average cost of capital in the valuation, this could
    have resulted in significant impairment losses

and/or

amortization expense.

Retirement
    benefits

Our Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined
    benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health
    care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada.
    Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and
    asset return performance. A substantial majority of plan assets
    are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity
    securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other
    investments. We follow SFAS No. 87
    “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and
    SFAS No. 106 “Employers’ Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” (as amended by
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”)
    for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense
    related to our retiree benefit plans. Embodied in both of these
    standards is the concept that the cost of benefits provided
    during retirement should be recognized over the employees’
    active working life. Inherent in this concept is the requirement
    to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure
    costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date.
    Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management
    judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our
    consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include
    the long- term rates of return on plan assets, the health care
    cost trend rates, and the interest rates used to discount the
    obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the
    United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.

To conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on
    plan assets, we model expected returns over a

20-year

investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix
    of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect
    a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and
    forward-looking views of the financial markets including
    consideration of current yields on long-term bonds,
    price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and
    long-term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to
    approximately 70% of our trust assets globally, currently
    incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an
    active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by
    historical analysis. Although we review our expected long-term
    rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment
    performance for one particular year does not, by itself,
    significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of
    return are generally not revised, provided these rates continue
    to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of
    between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected
    long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our
    assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2008 of 8.9%
    equated to approximately the 50th percentile expectation of
    our 2008 model. Similar methods are used for various foreign
    plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic
    conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately
    30% of our global benefit plan assets.

Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at January 3,
    2009, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of
    return would increase 2009 benefits expense by approximately
    $31 million. Correspondingly, a 100 basis point
    shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan
    assets for 2008 would result in a similar amount of arising
    experience loss. Any arising asset-related experience gain or
    loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a
    five-year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses
    are amortized using a declining-balance method over the average
    remaining service period of active plan participants, which for
    U.S. plans is presently about 13 years. Under this
    recognition method, a 100 basis point shortfall in actual
    versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2008
    would reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $1 million
    in 2010, increasing to approximately $5 million in 2014.
    For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan
    assets exceeded/(was less than) the recognized assumed return by
    the following amounts (in millions): 2008–$(1,528);
    2007–$(99); 2006–$257.

To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we
    model our actual claims cost data over a five-year historical
    period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age
    groups and other important demographic components of our covered
    retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the
    impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to
    distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health
    care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as
    necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience
    and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. In
    comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost



growth rate of approximately 5%, our initial trend rate for 2009
    of 7.5% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing
    claims experience for certain demographic groups within our
    total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward
    by 0.5% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is
    reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as
    necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate
    of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost
    premium. Based on consolidated obligations at January 3,
    2009, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care
    cost trend rates would increase 2009 benefits expense by
    approximately $15 million. A 100 basis point excess of
    2009 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from
    the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience
    loss of approximately $9 million. Any arising health care
    claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the
    calculated amount of claims experience over a four-year period.
    Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using
    a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least
    the minimum amortization prescribed by SFAS No. 106. The
    net experience gain arising from recognition of 2008 claims
    experience was approximately $4 million.

To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we use several
    published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to
    assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities, with a
    primary focus on the

Citigroup Pension Liability
    Index

®

for our U.S. plans. To test the appropriateness of these
    indices, we periodically conduct a matching exercise between the
    expected settlement cash flows of our plans and the bond
    maturities, consisting principally of

AA-rated

(or
    the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions) non-callable issues
    with at least $25 million principal outstanding. The model
    does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond
    investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become
    due. For those years where no suitable bonds are available, the
    portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a
    hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required
    in those years. During 2008, we refined our methodology for
    setting our discount rate by inputting the cash flows for our
    pension, postretirement and postemployment plans into the spot
    yield curve underlying the

Citigroup

index. The
    measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent
    with our fiscal year end. Accordingly, we select discount rates
    to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with
    market indices during December of each year.

Based on consolidated obligations at January 3, 2009, a
    25 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount
    rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase
    2009 benefits expense by approximately $13 million. All
    obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized
    using a straight-line method over the average remaining service
    period of active plan participants.

Despite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting
    major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material
    differences between assumed and actual experience. As of
    January 3, 2009, we had consolidated unamortized prior
    service cost and net experience losses of approximately
    $1.9 billion, as compared to approximately
    $0.6 billion at December 29, 2007. The year-over-year
    increase in net unamortized amounts was attributable primarily
    to poor asset performance during 2008. Of the total unamortized
    amounts at January 3, 2009, approximately $1.5 billion
    was related to asset losses during 2008, with the remainder
    largely related to discount rate reductions and net unfavorable
    health care claims experience (including upward revisions in the
    assumed trend rate) prior to 2008. For 2009, we currently expect
    total amortization of prior service cost and net experience
    losses to be approximately $11 million higher than the
    actual 2008 amount of approximately $58 million. Total
    employee benefit expense for 2009 is expected to be slightly
    higher than 2008 due to increased amortization of experience
    losses which is offset by assumed asset returns on our 2008
    contributions. Based on our current actuarial assumptions, we
    expect 2010 pension expense to increase significantly primarily
    due to the amortization of net experience losses.

During 2008 we made contributions in the amount of
    $354 million to Kellogg’s global tax-qualified pension
    programs. This amount was mostly discretionary. We anticipate
    having to make additional contributions in future years to make
    up for the poor performance of global equity markets during
    2008. Additionally we contributed $97 million to our
    retiree medical programs; most of this contribution was also
    discretionary and largely used to fund benefit obligations
    related to our union retiree healthcare benefits.

Assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current
    assumptions, annual amortization of accumulated prior service
    cost and net experience losses during each of the next several
    years would increase versus the 2008 amount.

Income
    taxes

Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax
    planning opportunities available to us in the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is required in
    evaluating our tax positions to determine how much benefit
    should be recognized in our income tax expense. We establish tax
    reserves in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48
    ‘‘Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes“
    (FIN No. 48) which we adopted at the beginning of 2007.
    FIN No. 48 is based on a benefit recognition model,
    which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit
    (and a lower amount of reserve) being initially recognized in
    certain



circumstances. Prior to the adoption of FIN No. 48,
    our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable
    outcome of known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution was
    recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the
    period of resolution. The initial application of
    FIN No. 48 resulted in a net decrease to the
    Company’s consolidated accrued income tax and related
    interest liabilities of approximately $2 million, with an
    offsetting increase to retained earnings.

The Company evaluates a tax position in two-steps in accordance
    with FIN No. 48. The first step is to determine
    whether it is more-likely-than not that a tax position will be
    sustained upon examination based upon the technical merit of the
    position. In weighing the technical merits of the position, we
    consider the facts and circumstances of the position; we assume
    the reviewing tax authority has full knowledge of the position;
    and we consider the weight of authoritative guidance. The second
    step is measurement; a tax position that meets the
    more-likely-than not recognition threshold is measured to
    determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
    statements. While reviewing the ranges of probable outcomes, the
    Company records the largest amount of benefit that is greater
    than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. The tax position will be derecognized when it is no
    longer more-likely-than not of being sustained.

For the periods presented, our income tax and related interest
    reserves have averaged approximately $175 million. Reserve
    adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1% of
    earnings before income taxes annually. Significant tax reserve
    adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately
    presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 11
    within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The current portion of our tax reserves is presented in the
    balance sheet within accrued income taxes and the amount
    expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other
    liabilities. Likewise, the current portion of related interest
    reserves are presented in the balance sheet within accrued other
    current liabilities, with the amount expected to be settled
    after one year recorded in other liabilities.

New
    accounting pronouncements

New accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1
    within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



FUTURE
    OUTLOOK

For 2009, despite a tough economic outlook, we expect our
    business model and strategy will deliver internal net sales
    growth of 3 to 4% and internal operating profit growth of mid
    single-digits (4 to 6%) which are in line with our long-term
    annual growth targets. We expect our earnings per share to grow
    at high single-digits (7 to 9%) on a currency neutral basis.
    Gross profit margin percentage is expected to remain
    approximately flat as our cost reduction initiatives and price
    realization offset pressure on cost of goods sold. Gross
    interest expense for 2009 is expected to decline to
    approximately $280 million driven by lower short-term
    interest rates. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be
    approximately 30% to 31%. We continue to remain committed to
    investing in brand building, cost-reduction initiatives, and
    other growth opportunities. Lastly, we expect our cash flow
    performance to remain strong and are currently expecting 2009
    cash flow to be between $1,050 million and
    $1,150 million after capital expenditures.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our Company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a
    part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative
    financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to
    manage these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not engage in
    trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 12
    within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information on our accounting policies related to derivative
    financial and commodity instruments.

Foreign
    exchange risk

Our Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash
    flows related to third-party purchases, intercompany loans and
    product shipments. Our Company is also exposed to fluctuations
    in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and
    cash flows related to repatriation of these investments.
    Additionally, our Company is exposed to volatility in the
    translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars.
    Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the
    British pound, euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and
    Mexican peso, and in the case of inter-subsidiary transactions,
    the British pound versus the euro. In addition, we have
    operations located in Venezuela where the local currency is
    exposed to a highly volatile economic environment. We assess
    foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and
    translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts,
    options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long
    or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are
    generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap
    agreements are established in conjunction with the term of
    underlying debt issuances.

The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative
    instruments at year-end 2008 was $924 million, representing
    a settlement receivable of $22 million. The total notional
    amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year-end
    2007 was $570 million, representing a settlement obligation
    of $9 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of
    anticipated transactions, translational exposure, or existing
    assets or liabilities, and mature within 18 months.
    Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year-end exchange rates,
    the settlement receivable would have decreased by approximately
    $92 million at year-end 2008 and the settlement obligation
    would have increased by $57 million at year-end 2007. These
    unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by
    favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures.

Interest
    rate risk

Our Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard
    to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future
    issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposures include
    movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered
    Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. We periodically use
    interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to
    reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated
    with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of
    variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected
    market conditions.

In connection with the issuance of U.S. Dollar Notes on
    March 6, 2008, we entered into interest rate swaps. Refer
    to disclosures contained in Note 7 within Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no interest rate
    derivatives outstanding at year-end 2007. Assuming average
    variable rate debt levels during the year, a one percentage
    point increase in interest rates would have increased interest
    expense by approximately $21 million in 2008 and
    $19 million in 2007.

Price
    risk

Our Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a
    result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials,
    fuel, and energy. Primary exposures include corn, wheat, soybean
    oil, sugar, cocoa, paperboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We
    have historically used the combination of long-term contracts
    with suppliers, and exchange-traded futures and option contracts
    to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of
    forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally
    less than 18 months. During 2006, we entered into two
    separate

10-year

over-the-counter commodity swap transactions to reduce
    fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our
    manufacturing processes. The notional amount of the swaps
    totaled $167 million as of January 3, 2009 and equates
    to approximately 50% of our North America manufacturing needs.
    At year-end 2007 the notional amount was $188 million.



The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at
    year-end 2008, including the North America natural gas swaps,
    was $267 million, representing a settlement obligation of
    approximately $16 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in
    year-end commodity prices, the settlement obligation would
    increase by approximately $24 million, generally offset by
    a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
    The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at
    year-end 2007, including the natural gas swaps, was
    $229 million, representing a settlement receivable of
    approximately $22 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in
    year-end commodity prices, this settlement receivable would
    decrease by approximately $22 million, generally offset by
    a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.

In some instances the Company has reciprocal collateralization
    agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in
    excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the
    posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities
    or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the
    Company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount. There
    were no collateral balance requirements at January 3, 2009
    or December 29, 2007.

In addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed
    above, we use long-term contracts with suppliers to manage a
    portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases
    of certain raw materials, including rice, sugar, cartonboard,
    and corrugated boxes. The Company has contracts in place with
    its suppliers that provide for pricing that is lower than market
    prices at January 3, 2009. It should be noted the exclusion
    of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation
    in assessing the net market risk of our Company.

Kellogg Company and
    Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis
    of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Kellogg Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries
    (“Kellogg” or the “Company”). Intercompany
    balances and transactions are eliminated.

The Company’s fiscal year normally ends on the Saturday
    closest to December 31 and as a result, a 53rd week is
    added approximately every sixth year. The Company’s 2007
    and 2006 fiscal years each contained 52 weeks and ended on
    December 29 and December 30, respectively. The
    Company’s 2008 fiscal year ended on January 3, 2009,
    and included a 53rd week. While quarters normally consist
    of 13-week periods, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 included a
    14th week.

Use
    of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
    disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Cash
    and cash equivalents

Highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Accounts
    receivable

Accounts receivable consist principally of trade receivables,
    which are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowances for
    doubtful accounts and prompt payment discounts. Trade
    receivables do not bear interest. Terms and collection patterns
    vary around the world and by channel. In the United States, the
    Company generally has required payment for goods sold eleven or
    sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as 2% 10/net 11
    or 1% 15/net 16, and days sales outstanding has averaged
    approximately 19 days during the periods presented. The
    allowance for doubtful accounts represents management’s
    estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing
    accounts receivable, as determined from a review of past due
    balances and other specific account data. Account balances are
    written off against the allowance when management determines the
    receivable is uncollectible. The Company does not have any
    off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
    Refer to Note 18 for an analysis of the Company’s
    accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful account balances
    during the periods presented.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost of market. Cost is
    determined on an average cost basis.

Property

The Company’s property consists mainly of plants and
    equipment used for manufacturing activities. These assets are
    recorded at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives
    using straight-line methods for financial reporting and
    accelerated methods, where permitted, for tax reporting. Major
    property categories are depreciated over various periods as
    follows (in years): manufacturing machinery and equipment 5-20;
    computer and other office equipment 3-5; building components

15-30;

building structures 50. Cost includes an amount of interest
    associated with significant capital projects. Plant and
    equipment are reviewed for impairment when conditions indicate
    that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions
    include an extended period of idleness or a plan of disposal.
    Assets to be abandoned at a future date are depreciated over the
    remaining period of use. Assets to be sold are written down to
    realizable value at the time the assets are being actively
    marketed for sale and the disposal is expected to occur within
    one year. As of year-end 2007 and 2008, the carrying value of
    assets held for sale was insignificant.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets

The Company’s goodwill and intangible assets are comprised
    primarily of amounts related to the 2001 acquisition of Keebler
    Foods Company (“Keebler”). Management expects the
    Keebler trademarks to contribute indefinitely to the cash flows
    of the Company. Accordingly, these intangible assets, have been
    classified as an indefinite-lived intangible. Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized, but are tested
    at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing
    first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair
    value of a reporting unit, which for the Company is generally
    equivalent to a North American product group or an International
    market. If carrying value exceeds fair value, goodwill is
    considered impaired and is reduced to the implied fair value.
    Impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets
    requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value
    of the intangible asset. If carrying value exceeds fair value,
    the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to
    fair value. The Company uses various market valuation techniques
    to determine the fair value of intangible assets. Refer to
    Note 2 for further information on goodwill and other
    intangible assets.



Revenue
    recognition and measurement

The Company recognizes sales upon delivery of its products to
    customers net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns,
    allowances, and various government withholding taxes.
    Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on
    local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range
    from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to
    reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where
    applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a
    combination of historical patterns and future expectations
    regarding specific in-market product performance. The Company
    classifies promotional payments to its customers, the cost of
    consumer coupons, and other cash redemption offers in net sales.
    The cost of promotional package inserts is recorded in cost of
    goods sold. Other types of consumer promotional expenditures are
    normally recorded in selling, general and administrative (SGA)
    expense.

Advertising

The costs of advertising are expensed as incurred and are
    classified within SGA expense.

Research
    and development

The costs of research and development (R&D) are expensed as
    incurred and are classified within SGA expense. R&D
    includes expenditures for new product and process innovation, as
    well as significant technological improvements to existing
    products and processes. Total annual expenditures for R&D
    are disclosed in Note 18 and are principally comprised of
    internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies attributable
    to time spent on R&D activities. Other costs include
    depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and
    equipment, including assets at manufacturing locations that are
    temporarily engaged in pilot plant activities.

Stock-based
    compensation

The Company uses stock-based compensation, including stock
    options, restricted stock and executive performance shares, to
    provide long-term performance incentives for its global
    workforce. Refer to Note 8 for further information on these
    programs and the amount of compensation expense recognized
    during the periods presented.

The Company classifies pre-tax stock compensation expense
    principally in SGA expense within its corporate operations.
    Expense attributable to awards of equity instruments is accrued
    in capital in excess of par value within the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

Certain of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans
    contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon
    retirement, disability, or death of eligible employees and
    directors. A stock-based award is considered vested for expense
    attribution purposes when the employee’s retention of the
    award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service.
    Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost
    immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible
    individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date
    retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated
    vesting period.

Corporate income tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting
    of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings
    (“windfall tax benefit”) is presented in the
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as a financing activity,
    classified as “other.” Realized windfall tax benefits
    are credited to capital in excess of par value in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits
    (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in
    earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of
    windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to
    income tax expense. The Company currently has sufficient
    cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb arising shortfalls,
    such that earnings were not affected during the periods
    presented. Correspondingly, the Company includes the impact of
    pro forma deferred tax assets (i.e., the “as if”
    windfall or shortfall) for purposes of determining assumed
    proceeds in the treasury stock calculation of diluted earnings
    per share.

Employee
    postretirement and postemployment benefits

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign plans to
    provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to
    retired employees, as well as salary continuance, severance, and
    long-term disability to former or inactive employees. Refer to
    Notes 9 and 10 for further information on these benefits
    and the amount of expense recognized during the periods
    presented.

In order to improve the reporting of pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans in the financial statements, in
    September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 158 “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans,” which was effective for the Company at the end of
    its 2006 fiscal year. Prior periods were not restated. The
    standard requires plan sponsors to measure the net over- or
    under-funded position of a defined postretirement benefit plan
    as of the sponsor’s fiscal year end and to display that
    position as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. Any
    unrecognized prior service cost, experience gains/losses, or
    transition obligation is reported as a component of other
    comprehensive income, net of tax, in shareholders’ equity.
    In contrast, under pre-existing guidance, these unrecognized
    amounts were disclosed in financial statement footnotes.

Uncertain
    tax positions

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”



(FIN No. 48) to clarify what criteria must be met
    prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit, in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes,” of a position taken in a tax return. The
    provisions of the final interpretation apply broadly to all tax
    positions taken by an enterprise, including the decision not to
    report income in a tax return or the decision to classify a
    transaction as tax exempt. The prescribed approach is based on a
    two-step benefit recognition model. The first step is to
    evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
    weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than
    not, based on the technical merits and without consideration of
    detection risk, that the position will be sustained on audit,
    including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes,
    if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of
    the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is
    measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater
    than 50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon
    settlement. The tax position must be derecognized when it is no
    longer more likely than not of being sustained. The
    interpretation also provides guidance on recognition and
    classification of related penalties and interest, classification
    of liabilities, and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits.
    The change in net assets, if any, as a result of applying the
    provisions of this interpretation is considered a change in
    accounting principle with the cumulative effect of the change
    treated as an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of
    retained earnings in the period of transition.

The Company adopted FIN No. 48 as of the beginning of
    its 2007 fiscal year. Prior to adoption, the Company’s
    pre-existing policy was to establish reserves for uncertain tax
    positions that reflected the probable outcome of known tax
    contingencies. As compared to the Company’s historical
    approach, the application of FIN No. 48 resulted in a
    net decrease to accrued income tax and related interest
    liabilities of approximately $2 million, with an offsetting
    increase to retained earnings.

Interest recognized in accordance with FIN No. 48 may
    be classified in the financial statements as either income taxes
    or interest expense, based on the accounting policy election of
    the enterprise. Similarly, penalties may be classified as income
    taxes or another expense. The Company has historically
    classified income tax-related interest and penalties as interest
    expense and SGA expense, respectively, and continues to do so
    under FIN No. 48.

Fair
    value measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” to define fair value,
    establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand
    disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company adopted
    the provisions of SFAS No. 157 applicable to financial
    assets and liabilities, as well as for other assets and
    liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis,
    as of the beginning of its 2008 fiscal year. The FASB provided
    for a deferral of the implementation of this standard for
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for
    those recognized at fair value in the financial statements at
    least annually. Adoption of the initial provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 did not have an impact on the measurement
    of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities but did
    result in additional disclosures contained in Note 13
    herein.

New
    accounting pronouncements

Business combinations and
    noncontrolling interests.

In December 2007, the
    FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised
    2007) “Business Combinations” and
    SFAS No. 160 “Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements,” which are effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. These new
    standards represent the completion of the FASB’s first
    major joint project with the International Accounting Standards
    Board and are intended to improve, simplify, and converge
    internationally the accounting for business combinations and the
    reporting of noncontrolling interests (formerly minority
    interests) in consolidated financial statements. Kellogg Company
    will adopt these standards at the beginning of its 2009 fiscal
    year. The effect of adoption will be prospectively applied to
    transactions completed after the end of the Company’s 2008
    fiscal year, although the new presentation and disclosure
    requirements for pre-existing noncontrolling interests will be
    retrospectively applied to all prior-period financial
    information presented.

SFAS No. 141(R) retains the underlying fair value
    concepts of its predecessor (SFAS No. 141), but
    changes the method for applying the acquisition method in a
    number of significant respects including the requirement to
    expense transaction fees and expected restructuring costs as
    incurred, rather than including these amounts in the allocated
    purchase price; the requirement to recognize the fair value of
    contingent consideration at the acquisition date, rather than
    the expected amount when the contingency is resolved; the
    requirement to recognize the fair value of acquired in-process
    research and development assets at the acquisition date, rather
    than immediately expensing them; and the requirement to
    recognize a gain in relation to a bargain purchase price, rather
    than reducing the allocated basis of long-lived assets. Because
    this standard is applied prospectively, the effect of adoption
    on the Company’s financial statements will depend primarily
    on specific transactions, if any, completed after 2008.

Under SFAS No. 160, consolidated financial statements
    will be presented as if the parent company investors
    (controlling interests) and other minority investors
    (noncontrolling interests) in partially-owned subsidiaries



have similar economic interests in a single entity. As a result,
    the investment in the noncontrolling interest, previously
    recorded on the balance sheet between liabilities and equity
    (the mezzanine), will be reported as equity in the parent
    company’s consolidated financial statements subsequent to
    the adoption of SFAS No. 160. Furthermore,
    consolidated financial statements will include 100% of a
    controlled subsidiary’s earnings, rather than only the
    parent company’s share. Lastly, transactions between the
    parent company and noncontrolling interests will be reported in
    equity as transactions between shareholders, provided that these
    transactions do not create a change in control. Previously,
    acquisitions of additional interests in a controlled subsidiary
    generally resulted in remeasurement of assets and liabilities
    acquired; dispositions of interests generally resulted in a gain
    or loss. The Company does not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 to have a material impact on its
    financial statements.

Disclosures about derivative
    instruments.

In March 2008, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” an amendment of
    SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 161 requires
    companies to disclose their objectives and strategies for using
    derivative instruments, whether or not their derivatives are
    designated as hedging instruments. The pronouncement requires
    disclosure of the fair value of derivative instruments by
    primary underlying risk exposures (e.g. interest rate, credit,
    foreign exchange rate, combination of interest rate and foreign
    exchange rate, or overall price). It also requires detailed
    disclosures about the income statement impact of derivative
    instruments by designation as fair-value hedges, cash-flow
    hedges, or hedges of the foreign-currency exposure of a net
    investment in a foreign operation. SFAS No. 161
    requires disclosure of information that will enable financial
    statement users to understand the level of derivative activity
    entered into by the company (e.g., total number of interest-rate
    swaps or total notional or quantity or percentage of forecasted
    commodity purchases that are being hedged). The principles of
    SFAS No. 161 may be applied on a prospective basis and
    are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008. For the Company,
    SFAS No. 161 will be effective at the beginning of its
    2009 fiscal year and will result in additional disclosures in
    notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Fair value.

In
    February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP)

FAS 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,” which
    delays by one year the effective date of SFAS No. 157
    for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities,
    except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value
    in the financial statements at least annually. Assets and
    liabilities subject to this deferral include goodwill,
    intangible assets, long-lived assets measured at fair value for
    impairment assessments, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    initially measured at fair value in a business combination. For
    the Company, FSP

FAS 157-2

will be effective at the beginning of its 2009 fiscal year.
    Management does not expect the adoption of the remaining
    provisions to have a material impact on the measurement of the
    Company’s non-financial assets and liabilities.

Disclosures about postretirement
    benefit plan assets.

In December 2008, the FASB
    issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
    about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets,” which provides
    additional guidance on employers’ disclosures about the
    plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement
    plans. The disclosures required by FSP FAS 132(R)-1 include
    a description of how investment allocation decisions are made,
    major categories of plan assets, valuation techniques used to
    measure the fair value of plan assets, the impact of
    measurements using significant unobservable inputs and
    concentrations of risk within plan assets. The disclosures about
    plan assets required by this FSP shall be provided for fiscal
    years ending after December 15, 2009. For the Company, FSP
    FAS 132(R)-1 will be effective for fiscal year end 2009 and
    will result in additional disclosures related to the assets of
    defined benefit pension plans in notes to the Company’s

ACQUISITIONS, OTHER INVESTMENTS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE
    ASSETS

Acquisitions

The Company made acquisitions in order to expand its presence
    geographically and increase its manufacturing capacity.

Assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the acquired
    businesses have been included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition; such
    amounts were insignificant to the Company’s consolidated
    financial position and results of operations. In addition, the
    pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the Company’s
    results of operations, as though these business combinations had
    been completed at the beginning of 2008 or 2007, would have been
    immaterial when considered individually or in the aggregate.

At January 3, 2009, the valuation of assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed in connection with these acquisitions is
    considered complete.

Specialty
    Cereals.

In September 2008, the Company acquired
    Specialty Cereals of Sydney, Australia, a manufacturer and
    distributor of natural

ready-to-eat

cereals. The Company paid $37 million cash in connection
    with the transaction, including approximately $5 million to
    the seller’s lenders to settle



debt of the acquired entity. Assets acquired consisted primarily
    of property, plant and equipment of $19 million and
    goodwill of $18 million (which will not be deductible for
    income tax purposes). This acquisition is included in the Asia
    Pacific operating segment.

IndyBake Products/Brownie
    Products.

In August 2008, the Company acquired
    certain assets and liabilities of the business of IndyBake
    Products and Brownie Products (collectively,
    “IndyBake”), located in Indiana and Illinois.
    IndyBake, a contract manufacturing business that produces
    cracker, cookie and frozen dough products, had been a partner to
    Kellogg for many years as a snacks contract manufacturer.

The Company paid approximately $42 million in cash in
    connection with the transaction, including approximately
    $8 million to the seller’s lenders. Assets acquired
    consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment of
    $12 million and goodwill of $25 million (which will be
    deductible for income tax purposes). Other assets acquired
    amounted to $5 million, net of other liabilities acquired.
    This acquisition is included in the North America operating
    segment.

Navigable
    Foods.

In June 2008, the Company acquired a
    majority interest in the business of Zhenghang Food Company Ltd.
    (“Navigable Foods”) for approximately $36 million
    (net of cash received). Navigable Foods, a manufacturer of
    cookies and crackers in the northern and northeastern regions of
    China, included approximately 1,800 employees, two
    manufacturing facilities and a sales and distribution network.

During 2008, the Company paid a total of $31 million in
    connection with the acquisition, including approximately
    $22 million to lenders and other third parties to settle
    debt and other obligations of the acquired entity. Assets
    acquired consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment of
    $23 million and goodwill of $19 million (which will be
    deductible for income tax purposes). Other liabilities acquired
    amounted to $6 million, net of other assets acquired. At
    January 3, 2009, additional purchase price payable in June
    2011 amounted to $5 million and was recorded on the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in other liabilities.
    This acquisition is included in the Asia Pacific operating
    segment.

The Company recorded noncontrolling interest of $6 million
    in connection with the acquisition, and obtained the option to
    purchase the noncontrolling interest beginning June 30,
    2011. The noncontrolling interest holder also obtained the
    option to cause the Company to purchase its remaining interest.
    The options, which have similar terms, include an exercise price
    that is expected to approximate fair value on the date of
    exercise.

United
    Bakers.

In January 2008, subsidiaries of the
    Company acquired substantially all of the equity interests in
    OJSC Kreker (doing business as “United Bakers”) and
    consolidated subsidiaries. United Bakers is a leading producer
    of cereal, cookie, and cracker products in Russia, with
    approximately 4,000 employees, six manufacturing
    facilities, and a broad distribution network.

The Company paid $110 million cash (net of $5 million
    cash acquired), including approximately $67 million to
    settle debt and other assumed obligations of the acquired
    entities. Of the total cash paid, $5 million was spent in
    2007 for transaction fees and advances. This acquisition is
    included in the Europe operating segment.

The purchase agreement between the Company and the seller
    provides for the payment of a currently undeterminable amount of
    contingent consideration at the end of three years, which will
    be calculated based on the growth of sales and earnings before
    income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Such payment will
    be recognized as additional purchase price when the contingency
    is resolved.

The purchase price allocation for United Bakers was as follows:

Bear Naked, Inc. and
    Wholesome & Hearty Foods Company.

In
    late 2007, the Company completed two separate business
    acquisitions for a total of approximately $123 million in
    cash, including related transaction costs. A subsidiary of the
    Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in Bear Naked,
    Inc., a leading seller of premium-branded natural granola
    products. Also, the Company acquired certain assets and
    liabilities of the Wholesome & Hearty Foods Company, a
    U.S. manufacturer of veggie foods marketed under the
    Gardenburger

®

brand. The combined purchase price allocation was as follows (in
    millions): Goodwill–$68; indefinite-lived trademark
    intangibles–$33; trademark intangibles with a

10-year

expected useful life–$5; equipment–$7; working capital
    and other individually immaterial items–$10. The amount of
    tax-deductible goodwill is currently expected to approximate the
    carrying value recognized for financial reporting purposes.
    These acquisitions are included in the North America operating
    segment.



Other
    investments

In early 2006, a subsidiary of the Company formed a joint
    venture with a third-party company domiciled in Turkey, for the
    purpose of selling co-branded products in the surrounding
    region. During 2007, the Company contributed approximately
    $4 million in cash to its Turkish joint venture, in which
    it owns a 50% equity interest. No additional contributions were
    made during 2008. The Company’s net investment as of
    January 3, 2009 was approximately $6 million. This
    joint venture is included in the Europe operating segment and is
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
    Accordingly, the Company records its share of the earnings or
    loss from this arrangement as well as other direct transactions
    with or on behalf of the joint venture entity such as product
    sales and certain administrative expenses.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets

For 2007, the Company recorded in selling, general, and
    administrative expense impairment losses of $7 million to
    write off the remaining carrying value of several individually
    insignificant trademarks, which were abandoned during the year.
    Associated gross carrying amounts of $16 million and the
    related accumulated amortization were retired from the
    Company’s balance sheet.

For the periods presented, the Company’s intangible assets

NOTE 3

EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

The Company views its continued spending on cost-reduction
    initiatives as part of its ongoing operating principles to
    provide greater visibility in achieving its long-term profit
    growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to
    recover cash implementation costs within a five-year period of
    completion. Each cost-reduction initiative is normally up to
    three years in duration. Upon completion (or as each major stage
    is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project
    begins to deliver cash savings

and/or

reduced depreciation.

Cost
    summary

The Company recorded $27 million of costs in 2008
    associated with exit or disposal activities comprised of
    $7 million of asset write offs, $17 million of
    severance and other cash costs and $3 million related to
    pension costs. $23 million of the 2008 charges were
    recorded in cost of goods sold within the Europe operating
    segment, with the balance recorded in selling, general and
    administrative (SGA) expense in the Latin America operating
    segment.

For 2007, the Company recorded charges of $100 million,
    comprised of $7 million of asset write-offs,
    $72 million for severance and other exit costs including
    route franchise settlements, $15 million for other cash
    expenditures, and $6 million for a multiemployer pension
    plan withdrawal liability. $23 million of the total 2007
    charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within the Europe
    operating segment results, with $77 million recorded in SGA
    expense within the North America operating results.

For 2006, the Company recorded charges of $82 million,
    comprised of $20 million of asset write-offs,
    $30 million for severance and other exit costs,
    $9 million for other cash expenditures, $4 million for
    a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability, and
    $19 million for pension and other postretirement plan
    curtailment losses and special termination benefits.
    $74 million was recorded in cost of goods sold within



operating segment results, with $8 million recorded in SGA
    expense within corporate results. The Company’s operating
    segments were impacted as follows (in millions): North
    America–$46; Europe–$28.

Exit cost reserves at January 3, 2009 were $2 million
    related to severance payments. Exit cost reserves were
    $5 million at December 29, 2007, consisting of
    $2 million for severance and $3 million for lease
    termination payments.

Specific
    initiatives

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company executed a
    cost-reduction initiative in Latin America that resulted in the
    elimination of approximately 120 salaried positions. The cost of
    the program was $4 million and was recorded in Latin
    America’s SGA expense. The charge related primarily to
    severance benefits which were paid by the end of the year. There
    were no reserves as of January 3, 2009 related to this
    program.

The Company commenced a multi-year European manufacturing
    optimization plan in 2006 to improve utilization of its facility
    in Manchester, England and to better align production in Europe.
    The project resulted in an elimination of approximately
    220 hourly and salaried positions from the Manchester
    facility through voluntary early retirement and severance
    programs. The pension trust funding requirements of these early
    retirements exceeded the recognized benefit expense by
    $5 million which was funded in 2006. During this program
    certain manufacturing equipment was removed from service.

All of the costs for the European manufacturing optimization
    plan have been recorded in cost of goods sold within the
    Company’s Europe operating segment. The following tables
    present total project costs and a reconciliation of employee
    severance reserves for this initiative. All other cash costs
    were paid in the period incurred. The project was completed in
    2008.

In October 2007, management committed to reorganize certain
    production processes at the Company’s plants in Valls,
    Spain and Bremen, Germany. Commencement of this plan followed
    consultation with union representatives at the Bremen facility
    regarding the elimination of approximately 120 employee
    positions. This reorganization plan improved manufacturing and
    distribution efficiency across the Company’s continental
    European operations, and has been completed as of the end of the
    Company’s 2008 fiscal year.

All of the costs for European production process realignment
    have been recorded in cost of goods sold within the
    Company’s Europe operating segment.

In July 2007, management commenced a plan to reorganize the
    Company’s direct store-door delivery (DSD) operations in
    the southeastern United States. This DSD reorganization plan was
    intended to integrate the Company’s southeastern sales and
    distribution regions with the rest of its U.S. DSD
    operations, resulting in greater efficiency across the
    nationwide network. The Company exited approximately 517
    distribution route franchise agreements with independent
    contractors. The plan also resulted in the involuntary
    termination or relocation of approximately 300 employee
    positions. Total project costs incurred were $77 million,
    principally consisting of cash expenditures for route franchise
    settlements and to a lesser extent, for employee separation,
    relocation, and reorganization. Exit cost reserves were
    $3 million as of December 29, 2007 and were paid in
    2008. This initiative is complete.

During 2006, the Company commenced several initiatives to
    enhance the productivity and efficiency of its U.S. cereal
    manufacturing network, primarily through technological and
    sourcing improvements in warehousing and packaging operations.
    In conjunction with these initiatives, the Company offered
    voluntary separation incentives, which resulted in the
    retirement of approximately 80 hourly employees by early
    2007. During 2006, the Company incurred approximately
    $15 million of total up-front costs, comprised of
    approximately 20% asset write-offs and 80% cash



costs, including $10 million of pension and other
    postretirement plan curtailment losses. These initiatives were
    complete by the end of 2007.

Also during 2006, the Company undertook an initiative to improve
    customer focus and selling efficiency within a particular Latin
    American market, leading to a shift from a third-party
    distributor to a direct sales force model. As a result of this
    initiative, the Company paid $8 million in cash during 2006
    to exit the existing distribution arrangement.

During 2008 the Company finalized its pension plan withdrawal
    liability related to its North America snacks bakery
    consolidation which was executed in 2005 and 2006. The final
    liability was $20 million, $16 million of which was
    recognized in 2005 and $4 million in 2006; and was paid in
    the third quarter of 2008.

NOTE 4

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET

Other income (expense), net includes non-operating items such as
    interest income, charitable donations, and gains and losses from
    foreign currency exchange and commodity derivatives.

Other income (expense), net includes charges for contributions
    to the Kellogg’s Corporate Citizenship Fund, a private
    trust established for charitable giving, as follows (in
    millions): 2008–$4; 2007–$12; 2006–$3. Interest
    income was (in millions): 2008–$20; 2007–$23;
    2006–$11. Net foreign currency exchange gains (losses) were
    (in millions): 2008–$5; 2007–$(8); 2006–$(2).
    Income (expense) recognized for premiums on commodity options
    was (in millions): 2008–$(12); 2007–$(7);
    2006–$0. Gains (losses) on Company Owned Life Insurance
    (“COLI”), due to changes in cash surrender value, were
    (in millions): 2008–$(12); 2007–$9; 2006–$12.

NOTE 5

EQUITY

During the year ended December 30, 2006, the Company
    revised the classification of $101 million of prior net
    losses realized upon reissuance of treasury shares from capital
    in excess of par value to retained earnings on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. Such reissuances occurred in connection with
    employee and director stock option exercises and other
    share-based settlements. The revision did not have an effect on
    the Company’s results of operations, total
    shareholders’ equity, or cash flows.

Earnings
    per share

Basic net earnings per share is determined by dividing net
    earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share is
    similarly determined, except that the denominator is increased
    to include the number of additional common shares that would
    have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares
    had been issued. Dilutive potential common shares are comprised
    principally of employee stock options issued by the Company.
    Basic net earnings per share is reconciled to diluted net
    earnings per share in the following table. The total number of
    anti-dilutive potential common shares excluded from the
    reconciliation for each period was (in millions): 2008–5.8;
    2007–0.8; 2006–0.7.

Stock
    transactions

The Company issues shares to employees and directors under
    various equity-based compensation and stock purchase programs,
    as further discussed in Note 8. The number of shares issued
    during the periods presented was (in millions): 2008–5;
    2007–4; 2006–7. Additionally, during 2006, the Company
    established

Kellogg
    Direct

tm

,

    a direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan for
    U.S. shareholders. The total number of shares issued for
    that purpose was less than one million in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

To offset these issuances and for general corporate purposes,
    the Company’s Board of Directors has authorized management
    to repurchase specified amounts of the Company’s common
    stock in each of the periods presented. In each of the years
    2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company spent $650 million to
    repurchase the following number of shares (in millions);
    2008–13; 2007–12; and 2006–15. The 2006 activity
    consisted principally of a February 2006 private transaction
    with the W. K. Kellogg Foundation Trust to repurchase
    approximately 13 million shares for $550 million.

On July 25, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of $500 million of Kellogg common stock during
    2008 and 2009 for general corporate purposes and to offset
    issuances for employee benefit programs. No purchases were made
    under this program. This authorization was canceled on



February 4, 2009 and replaced with a $650 million
    authorization for 2009.

Comprehensive
    income

Comprehensive income includes net earnings and all other changes
    in equity during a period except those resulting from
    investments by or distributions to shareholders. Other
    comprehensive income for the periods presented consists of
    foreign currency translation adjustments pursuant to
    SFAS No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation,”
    unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges pursuant to
    SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and beginning in 2007
    includes adjustments for net experience losses and prior service
    cost pursuant to SFAS No. 158 “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans.” The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of
    the end of its 2006 fiscal year.

During 2008, the assets of the Company’s postretirement and
    postemployment benefit plans suffered losses of over
    $1 billion due to the asset allocation of 70% in the equity
    market. These losses are recognized in other comprehensive
    income and for pension plans is recognized in the calculated
    value of plan assets over a five-year period and once
    recognized, are amortized using a declining-balance method over
    the average remaining service period of active plan participants.

NOTE 6

LEASES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

The Company’s leases are generally for equipment and
    warehouse space. Rent expense on all operating leases was (in
    millions): 2008-$145; 2007-$135; 2006-$123. The Company was
    subject to a residual value guarantee on one operating lease of
    approximately $13 million, which was scheduled to expire in
    July 2007. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company
    recognized a liability in connection with this guarantee of
    approximately $5 million, which was recorded in cost of
    goods sold within the Company’s North America operating
    segment. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company
    terminated the lease agreement and purchased the facility for
    approximately $16 million, which discharged the residual
    value guarantee obligation. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company entered into approximately $3 million,
    $5 million and $2 million, respectively, in capital

One of the Company’s subsidiaries was guarantor on loans to

    franchises. In July 2007, the Company exited these agreements.
    Refer to Note 3 for further information.

The Company has provided various standard indemnifications in
    agreements to sell and purchase business assets and lease
    facilities over the past several years, related primarily to
    pre-existing tax, environmental, and employee benefit
    obligations. Certain of these indemnifications are limited by
    agreement in either amount

and/or

term
    and others are unlimited. The Company has also provided various
    “hold harmless” provisions within certain service type
    agreements. Because the Company is not currently aware of any
    actual exposures associated with these indemnifications,
    management is unable to estimate the maximum potential future
    payments to be made. At January 3, 2009, the Company had
    not recorded any liability related to these indemnifications.

On March 6, 2008, the Company
    issued $750 million of five-year 4.25% fixed rate U.S.
    Dollar Notes, using the proceeds from these Notes to retire a
    portion of its U.S. commercial paper. These Notes were issued
    under an existing shelf registration statement. The Notes
    contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the
    Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur
    certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back
    transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of
    control provision. In conjunction with this debt issuance, the
    Company entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts
    totaling $750 million, which effectively converted this
    debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the
    duration of the five-year term. These derivative instruments,
    which were designated as fair value hedges of the debt
    obligation, resulted in an effective interest rate of 3.09% as
    of January 3, 2009. The fair value adjustment for the
    interest rate swaps was $43 million at January 3,
    2009, and is recorded directly in the hedged debt balance.

In February 2007, the Company and two of its subsidiaries (the
    “Issuers”) established a program under which the
    Issuers may issue euro-commercial paper notes up to a maximum
    aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $750 million or
    its equivalent in alternative currencies. The notes may have
    maturities ranging up to 364 days and will be senior
    unsecured obligations of the applicable Issuer. Notes issued by
    subsidiary Issuers will be guaranteed by the Company. The notes
    may be issued at a discount or may bear fixed or floating rate
    interest or a coupon calculated by reference to an index or
    formula. As of January 3, 2009, no notes were outstanding
    under this program.

At January 3, 2009, the Company had $2.2 billion of
    short-term lines of credit, virtually all of which were unused
    and available for borrowing on an unsecured basis. These lines
    were comprised principally of an unsecured Five-Year Credit
    Agreement, which the Company entered into during November 2006
    and expires in 2011. The agreement allows the Company to borrow,
    on a revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion, to obtain
    letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to $75 million,
    and to provide a procedure for lenders to bid on short-term debt
    of the Company. The agreement contains customary covenants and
    warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness,
    liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and a specified interest
    coverage ratio. If an event of default occurs, then, to the
    extent permitted, the administrative agent may terminate the
    commitments under the credit facility, accelerate any
    outstanding loans, and demand the deposit of cash collateral
    equal to the lender’s letter of credit exposure plus
    interest. The Company entered into a $400 million unsecured

364-Day

Credit Agreement effective January 31, 2007, containing
    customary covenants, warranties, and restrictions similar to
    those described herein for the Five-Year Credit Agreement. The
    facility was available for general corporate purposes, including
    commercial paper

back-up.

The
    $400 million Credit Agreement expired at the end of January
    2008 and the Company did not renew it.

Scheduled principal repayments on long-term debt are (in
    millions): 2009–$1; 2010–$1; 2011–$1,428;
    2012–$751; 2013–$752; 2014 and beyond–$1,108.

Interest paid was (in millions): 2008–$305; 2007–$305;
    2006–$299. Interest expense capitalized as part of the
    construction cost of fixed assets was (in millions):
    2008–$6; 2007–$5; 2006–$3.

NOTE 8

STOCK COMPENSATION

The Company uses various equity-based compensation programs to
    provide long-term performance incentives for its global
    workforce. Currently, these incentives consist principally of
    stock options, and to a lesser extent, executive performance
    shares and restricted stock grants. The Company also sponsors a
    discounted stock purchase plan in the United States and
    matching-grant programs in several international locations.
    Additionally, the Company awards stock options and restricted
    stock to its outside directors. These awards are administered
    through several plans, as described within this Note.

The 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2003 Plan”),
    approved by shareholders in 2003, permits benefits to be awarded
    to employees and officers in the form of incentive and
    non-qualified stock options, performance units, restricted stock
    or restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. The
    2003 Plan authorizes the issuance of a total of
    (a) 25 million shares plus (b) shares not issued
    under the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan, with no more than
    5 million shares to be issued in satisfaction of
    performance units, performance-based restricted shares and other
    awards (excluding stock options and stock appreciation rights),
    and with additional annual limitations on awards or payments to
    individual participants. At January 3, 2009, there were
    6.6 million remaining authorized, but unissued, shares
    under the 2003 Plan. During the periods presented, specific
    awards and terms of those awards granted under the 2003 Plan are
    described in the following sections of this Note.

The Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (“Director Plan”)
    was approved by shareholders in 2000 and allows each eligible
    non-employee director to receive 2,100 shares of the
    Company’s common stock annually and annual grants of
    options to purchase 5,000 shares of the Company’s
    common stock. At January 3, 2009, there were
    0.3 million remaining authorized, but unissued, shares
    under this plan. Shares other than options are placed in the
    Kellogg Company Grantor Trust for Non-Employee Directors (the
    “Grantor Trust”). Under the terms of the Grantor
    Trust, shares are available to a director only upon termination
    of service on the Board. Under this plan, awards were as
    follows: 2008–54,465 options and 19,964 shares;
    2007–51,791 options and 21,702 shares;
    2006–50,000 options and 17,000 shares. Options granted
    to directors under this plan are included in the option activity
    tables within this Note.



The 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was approved by
    shareholders in 2002 and permits eligible employees to purchase
    Company stock at a discounted price. This plan allows for a
    maximum of 2.5 million shares of Company stock to be issued
    at a purchase price equal to 95% of the fair market value of the
    stock on the last day of the quarterly purchase period. Total
    purchases through this plan for any employee are limited to a
    fair market value of $25,000 during any calendar year. The Plan
    was amended in 2007. Prior to amendment, Company stock was
    issued at a purchase price equal to 85% of the fair market value
    of the stock on the first or last day of the quarterly purchase
    period. At January 3, 2009, there were 1.1 million
    remaining authorized, but unissued, shares under this plan.
    Shares were purchased by employees under this plan as follows
    (approximate number of shares): 2008–157,000;
    2007–232,000; 2006–237,000. Options granted to
    employees to purchase discounted stock under this plan are
    included in the option activity tables within this Note.

Additionally, during 2002, a foreign subsidiary of the Company
    established a stock purchase plan for its employees. Subject to
    limitations, employee contributions to this plan are matched 1:1
    by the Company. Under this plan, shares were granted by the
    Company to match an approximately equal number of shares
    purchased by employees as follows (approximate number of
    shares): 2008–78,000; 2007–75,000; 2006–80,000.

The Executive Stock Purchase Plan was established in 2002 to
    encourage and enable certain eligible employees of the Company
    to acquire Company stock, and to align more closely the
    interests of those individuals and the Company’s
    shareholders. This plan allowed for a maximum of
    500,000 shares of Company stock to be issued. Under this
    plan in 2006, approximately 4,000 shares were granted by
    the Company to executives in lieu of cash bonuses. No shares
    were granted under this plan in 2007. The plan expired in 2007
    with approximately 460,000 authorized but unissued shares
    remaining unused.

Compensation expense for all types of equity-based programs and
    the related income tax benefit recognized were as follows:

Pre-tax compensation expense for 2008 included $4 million
    of expense related to the modification of certain stock options
    to eliminate the accelerated ownership feature (“AOF”)
    and $13 million representing cash compensation to holders
    of modified stock options to replace the value of the AOF, which
    is discussed in the section, “Stock options.”

As of January 3, 2009, total stock-based compensation cost
    related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was approximately
    $29 million and the weighted-average period over which this
    amount was expected to be recognized was approximately
    1.4 years.

Cash flows realized upon exercise or vesting of stock-based
    awards in the periods presented are included in the following
    table. Tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting of
    stock-based awards generally represent the tax benefit of the
    difference between the exercise price and the strike price of
    the option.

Cash used by the Company to settle equity instruments granted
    under stock-based awards was insignificant.

Shares used to satisfy stock-based awards are normally issued
    out of treasury stock, although management is authorized to
    issue new shares to the extent permitted by respective plan
    provisions. Refer to Note 5 for information on shares
    issued during the periods presented to employees and directors
    under various long-term incentive plans and share repurchases
    under the Company’s stock repurchase authorizations. The
    Company does not currently have a policy of repurchasing a
    specified number of shares issued under employee benefit
    programs during any particular time period.

Stock
    options

During the periods presented, non-qualified stock options were
    granted to eligible employees under the 2003 Plan with exercise
    prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s
    stock on the grant date, a contractual term of ten years, and a
    two-year graded vesting period. Grants to outside directors
    under the Director Plan included similar terms, but vested
    immediately.

Effective April 25, 2008, the Company eliminated the AOF
    from all outstanding stock options. Stock options that contained
    the AOF feature included the vested pre-2004 option awards and
    all reload options. Reload options are the stock options awarded
    to eligible employees and directors to replace previously owned
    Company stock used by those individuals to pay the exercise
    price, including related employment taxes, of vested pre-2004
    options awards containing the AOF. The reload options were
    immediately vested with an expiration date which was the same as
    the original option grant. Apart from removing the AOF, the
    stock



options were not otherwise affected. Holders of the stock
    options received cash compensation to replace the value of the
    AOF.

The Company accounted for the elimination of the AOF as a
    modification in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment,” which required the Company to
    record a modification charge equal to the difference between the
    value of the modified stock options on the date of modification
    and their values immediately prior to modification. Since the
    modified stock options were 100% vested and had relatively short
    remaining contractual terms of one to five years, the Company
    used a Black-Scholes model to value the awards for the purpose
    of calculating the modification charge. The total fair value of
    the modified stock options increased by $4 million due to
    an increase in the expected term.

As a result of this action, pre-tax compensation expense for
    2008 included $4 million of expense related to the
    modification of stock options and $13 million representing
    cash compensation paid to holders of the stock options to
    replace the value of the AOF. Approximately 900 employees
    were holders of the modified stock options.

Management estimates the fair value of each annual stock option
    award on the date of grant using a lattice-based option
    valuation model. Composite assumptions are presented in the
    following table. Weighted-average values are disclosed for
    certain inputs which incorporate a range of assumptions.
    Expected volatilities are based principally on historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock, and to a lesser extent,
    on implied volatilities from traded options on the
    Company’s stock. Historical volatility corresponds to the
    contractual term of the options granted. The Company uses
    historical data to estimate option exercise and employee
    termination within the valuation models; separate groups of
    employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are
    considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term
    of options granted represents the period of time that options
    granted are expected to be outstanding; the weighted-average
    expected term for all employee groups is presented in the
    following table. The risk-free rate for periods within the
    contractual life of the options is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Other
    stock-based awards

During the periods presented, other stock-based awards consisted
    principally of executive performance shares and restricted stock
    granted under the 2003 Plan.

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company made performance share
    awards to a limited number of senior executive-level employees,
    which entitles these employees to receive a specified number of
    shares of the Company’s common stock on the vesting date,
    provided cumulative three-year targets are achieved. The
    cumulative three-year targets involved operating profit for the
    2008 grant, cash flow for the 2007 grant and net sales growth
    for the 2006 grant. Management estimates the fair value of
    performance share awards based on the market price of the
    underlying stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present
    value of estimated dividends foregone during the performance
    period. The 2008, 2007 and 2006 target grants (as revised for
    non-vested forfeitures and other adjustments) currently
    correspond to approximately 187,000, 185,000 and
    241,000 shares, respectively, with a grant-date fair value
    of approximately $47, $46,



and $41 per share. The actual number of shares issued on the
    vesting date could range from zero to 200% of target, depending
    on actual performance achieved. Based on the market price of the
    Company’s common stock at year-end 2008, the maximum future
    value that could be awarded on the vesting date was (in
    millions): 2008 award–$17; 2007 award–$17; and 2006
    award–$22. The 2005 performance share award, payable in
    stock, was settled at 200% of target in February 2008 for a
    total dollar equivalent of $28 million.

The Company also periodically grants restricted stock and
    restricted stock units to eligible employees under the 2003
    Plan. Restrictions with respect to sale or transferability
    generally lapse after three years and the grantee is normally
    entitled to receive shareholder dividends during the vesting
    period. Management estimates the fair value of restricted stock
    grants based on the market price of the underlying stock on the
    date of grant. A summary of restricted stock activity for the
    year ended January 3, 2009, is presented in the following
    table:

NOTE 9

PENSION BENEFITS

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign pension
    plans to provide retirement benefits for its employees. The
    majority of these plans are funded or unfunded defined benefit
    plans, although the Company does participate in a limited number
    of multiemployer or other defined contribution plans for certain
    employee groups. Defined benefits for salaried employees are
    generally based on salary and years of service, while union
    employee benefits are generally a negotiated amount for each
    year of service. The Company uses its fiscal year end as the
    measurement date for its defined benefit plans.

Obligations
    and funded status

The aggregate change in projected benefit obligation, plan
    assets, and funded status is presented in the following tables.
    The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” as of the end of its 2006 fiscal year. The standard
    generally requires company plan sponsors to reflect the net
    over- or under-funded position of a defined postretirement
    benefit plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet.

Any arising obligation-related experience gain or loss is
    amortized using a straight-line method over the average
    remaining service period of active plan participants. Any
    asset-related experience gain or loss is recognized as described
    in the “Assumptions” section. The estimated net
    experience loss and prior service cost for defined benefit
    pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other
    comprehensive income into pension expense over the next fiscal
    year are approximately $44 million and $12 million,
    respectively.

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries sponsor 401(k) or
    similar savings plans for active employees. Expense related to
    these plans was (in millions): 2008–$37; 2007–$36;
    2006–$33. Company contributions to these savings plans
    approximate annual expense. Company contributions to
    multiemployer and other defined contribution pension plans
    approximate the amount of annual expense presented in the
    preceding table.

To determine the overall expected long-term rate of return on

investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix
    of its major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a
    combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and
    forward-looking views of the financial markets including
    consideration of current yields on long-term bonds,
    price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and
    long-term inflation. The U.S. model, which corresponds to
    approximately 70% of consolidated pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan assets, incorporates a long-term
    inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of
    1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Similar
    methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets,
    reflecting local economic conditions. Although management
    reviews the Company’s expected long-term rates of return
    annually, the benefit trust investment performance for one
    particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence
    this evaluation. The expected rates of return are generally not
    revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a
    “more likely than not” corridor of between the
    25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term
    returns, as determined by the Company’s modeling process.
    The expected rate of return for 2008 of 8.9% equated to
    approximately the 50th percentile expectation. Any future
    variance between the expected and actual rates of return on plan
    assets is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over
    a five-year period and once recognized, experience gains and
    losses are amortized using a declining-balance method over the
    average remaining service period of active plan participants.

To conduct the annual review of discount rates, the Company uses
    several published market indices with appropriate duration
    weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt
    securities, with a primary focus on the

Citigroup Pension
    Liability
    Index

®

for the U.S. plans. To test the appropriateness of these
    indices, the Company periodically conducts a matching exercise
    between the expected settlement cash flows of the plans and the
    bond maturities, consisting principally of

AA-rated

(or
    the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions) non-callable issues
    with at least $25 million principal outstanding. The model
    does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond
    investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become
    due. For those years where no suitable bonds are available, the
    portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a
    hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required
    in those years. During 2008, the Company refined the methodology
    for setting the discount rate by inputting the cash flows for
    the pension, postretirement and postemployment plans into the
    spot yield curve underlying the

Citigroup

index. The
    measurement dates for the defined benefit plans are consistent
    with the Company’s fiscal year end. Accordingly, the
    Company selects discount rates to measure the benefit
    obligations that are consistent with market indices during
    December of each year.

The Company’s investment strategy for its major defined
    benefit plans is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset
    classes with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash
    requirements as they become due. Assets are invested in a
    prudent manner to maintain the security of funds while
    maximizing returns within the Company’s guidelines. The
    current weighted-average target asset allocation reflected by
    this strategy is: equity securities–74%; debt
    securities–24%; other–2%. Investment in Company common
    stock represented 1.8% and 1.5% of consolidated plan assets at
    January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, respectively.
    Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and
    funding requirements. The Company currently expects to
    contribute approximately $85 million to its defined benefit
    pension plans during 2009.

Benefit
    payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future
    service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid (in millions):
    2009–$174; 2010–$180; 2011–$194; 2012–$188;
    2013–$193; 2014 to 2018–$1,083.

NOTE 10

NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Postretirement

The Company sponsors a number of plans to provide health care
    and other welfare benefits to retired employees in the United
    States and Canada, who have met certain age and service
    requirements. The majority of these plans are funded or unfunded
    defined benefit plans, although the Company does participate in
    a limited number of multiemployer or other defined contribution
    plans for certain employee groups. The Company contributes to
    voluntary employee benefit association (VEBA) trusts to fund
    certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit
    obligations. The Company uses its fiscal year end as the
    measurement date for these plans.

Obligations
    and funded status

The aggregate change in accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation, plan assets, and funded status is presented in the
    following tables. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans” as of the end of its 2006
    fiscal year. The standard generally requires company plan
    sponsors to reflect the net over- or under-funded position of a
    defined postretirement benefit plan as an asset or liability on
    the balance sheet.

Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or
    loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience
    over a four-year period and once recognized, is amortized using
    a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least
    the minimum amortization prescribed by SFAS No. 106.
    Any asset-related experience gain or loss is recognized as
    described for pension plans on page 46. The estimated net
    experience loss for defined benefit plans that will be amortized
    from accumulated other comprehensive income into nonpension
    postretirement benefit expense over the next fiscal year is
    approximately $13 million,



partially offset by amortization of prior service credit of
    $3 million.

Net losses from curtailment and special termination benefits
    recognized in 2006 are related primarily to plant workforce
    reductions in the United States as further described in
    Note 3.

The Company determines the overall discount rate and expected

    the same manner as that described for pension trusts in
    Note 9.

The assumed health care cost trend rate is 7.6% for 2009,
    decreasing gradually to 4.5% by the year 2015 and remaining at
    that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect the
    Company’s recent historical experience and
    management’s expectations regarding future trends. A one

The Company’s asset investment strategy for its VEBA trusts

    securities and 25% debt securities. The Company currently
    expects to contribute approximately $15 million to its VEBA
    trusts during 2009.

Postemployment

Under certain conditions, the Company provides benefits to
    former or inactive employees in the United States and several
    foreign locations, including salary continuance, severance, and
    long-term disability. The Company recognizes an obligation for
    any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service.
    Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with
    service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather
    than years of service) or costs arising from actions that offer
    benefits to employees in excess of those specified in the
    respective plans are charged to expense when incurred. The
    Company’s postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.
    Actuarial assumptions used are generally consistent with those
    presented for pension benefits on page 46. The aggregate
    change in accumulated postemployment benefit obligation and the
    net amount recognized were:

Effective income tax rate

29.7%

28.7%

31.7%

As presented in the preceding table, the Company’s 2008
    consolidated effective tax rate was 29.7%, as compared to 28.7%
    in 2007 and 31.7% in 2006. The 2008 effective tax rate reflects
    the favorable impact of various tax audit settlements. In
    conjunction with a planned international legal restructuring,
    management recorded a $33 million tax charge in the second
    quarter and an additional $9 million during the third and
    fourth quarters for a total charge of $42 million on
    $1 billion of prior and current year unremitted foreign
    earnings and capital. During the year, the Company repatriated
    approximately $710 million of earnings and capital which
    carried a cash tax charge of $24 million. This amount was
    less than the charge recorded during the year due to the impact
    of favorable movements in foreign currency. This cost was
    further offset by foreign tax related items of $16 million,
    reducing the net cost of repatriation to $8 million. The
    Company has provided $18 million of deferred taxes related
    to the remaining $290 million of unremitted foreign
    earnings. These amounts are reflected in the foreign earnings
    repatriation line item. At January 3, 2009, accumulated
    foreign subsidiary earnings of approximately $834 million
    were considered indefinitely  invested in those businesses.
    Accordingly, U.S. income deferred taxes have not been provided
    on these earnings and it is not practical to estimate the
    deferred tax impact of those earnings.

2007’s effective rate benefited from the favorable effect
    of discrete items in that year. In the first quarter of 2007,
    management implemented an international restructuring initiative
    which eliminated a foreign tax liability of approximately
    $40 million. Accordingly, the reversal was recorded within
    the Company’s consolidated provision for income taxes. The
    Company benefited from statutory rate reductions, primarily in
    the United Kingdom and in Germany which resulted in an
    $11 million reduction to income tax expense. During 2007,
    the Company repatriated approximately $327 million of
    current year foreign earnings, for a gross U.S. tax cost of
    $35 million. This cost was offset by foreign tax credit
    related items of $31 million, reducing the net cost of
    repatriation to $4 million.

The Company’s 2006 consolidated effective tax rate included
    two significant, but partially-offsetting, discrete adjustments.
    The Company reduced its reserves for uncertain tax positions by
    $25 million, related principally to the closure of several
    domestic tax audits. In addition, the Company revised its
    repatriation plan for certain foreign earnings, giving rise to
    an incremental net tax cost of $18 million.

Generally, the changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax
    assets and corresponding impacts on the effective income tax
    rate result from management’s assessment of the
    Company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions,
    operating losses and tax credit carryforwards prior to
    expiration. For 2007, the .5% rate reduction presented in the
    preceding table primarily reflects the reversal of a valuation
    allowance against U.S. foreign tax credits which were
    utilized in conjunction with the aforementioned 2007 foreign
    earnings repatriation. Total tax benefits of carryforwards at
    year-end 2008 and 2007 were approximately $27 million and
    $17 million, respectively, with related valuation
    allowances at year-end 2008 and 2007 of approximately $20 and
    $17 million. Of the total carryforwards at year-end 2008
    approximately



$2 million expire in 2009 with the remainder principally
    expiring after five years.

The following table provides an analysis of the Company’s
    deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2008 and
    2007. The significant increase in the “employee
    benefits” caption of the Company’s noncurrent deferred
    tax asset during 2008 is principally related to net experience
    losses associated with employer pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans that are recorded in other comprehensive income,
    net of tax.

Uncertain
    tax positions

The Company adopted Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN No. 48) as of the beginning of its 2007
    fiscal year. This interpretation clarifies what criteria must be
    met prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit, in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes,” of a position taken in a tax return.

FIN No. 48 is based on a benefit recognition model.
    Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of
    being sustained, FIN No. 48 permits a company to
    recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon
    settlement. The tax position must be derecognized when it is no
    longer more likely than not of being sustained. The initial
    application of FIN No. 48 resulted in a net decrease
    to the Company’s consolidated accrued income tax and
    related interest liabilities of approximately $2 million,
    with an offsetting increase to retained earnings.

The Company files income taxes in the U.S. federal
    jurisdiction, and in various state, local, and foreign
    jurisdictions. For the past several years, the Company’s
    annual provision for U.S. federal income taxes has
    represented approximately 70% of the Company’s consolidated
    income tax provision. With limited exceptions, the Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) for years prior to 2006. During the second
    quarter of 2008, the IRS commenced a focused review of the
    Company’s 2006 and 2007 U.S. federal income tax
    returns which is anticipated to be completed during the second
    quarter of 2009. The Company also entered into the IRS’
    Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”) for the 2008 tax
    year. The Company is also under examination for income and
    non-income tax filings in various state and foreign
    jurisdictions, most notably: 1) a

U.S.-Canadian

transfer pricing issue pending international arbitration
    (“Competent Authority”) with a related advanced
    pricing agreement for years

1997-2008;

and 2) an on-going examination of

2002-2005

U.K. income tax filings.

As of January 3, 2009, the Company has classified
    $35 million of unrecognized tax benefits as a current
    liability, representing several individually insignificant
    income tax positions under examination in various jurisdictions.
    Management’s estimate of reasonably possible changes in
    unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months is
    comprised of the aforementioned current liability balance
    expected to be settled within one year, offset by approximately
    $5 million of projected additions related primarily to
    ongoing intercompany transfer pricing activity. Management is
    currently unaware of any issues under review that could result
    in significant additional payments, accruals, or other material
    deviation in this estimate.

Following is a reconciliation of the Company’s total gross
    unrecognized tax benefits as of the years ended January 3,
    2009 and December 29, 2007. For the



2008 year, approximately $110 million represents the
    amount that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s
    effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs
    from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table
    due to the decrease in U.S. federal income taxes which
    would occur upon recognition of the state tax benefits included
    therein.

The current portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax

    to be settled after one year is recorded in other liabilities.

The Company classifies income tax-related interest and penalties
    as interest expense and selling, general, and administrative
    expense, respectively. For the year ended January 3, 2009,
    the Company recognized a reduction of $2 million of
    tax-related interest and penalties and had approximately
    $29 million accrued at January 3, 2009. For the year
    ended December 29, 2007, the company recognized
    $9 million of tax-related interest and penalties and had
    $31 million accrued at year end.

NOTE 12

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATION

The carrying values of the Company’s short-term items,
    including cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
    payable and notes payable approximate fair value. The fair value
    of long-term debt is calculated based on incremental borrowing
    rates currently available on loans with similar terms and
    maturities. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt
    at January 3, 2009 exceeded its carrying value by
    approximately $246 million.

The Company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a
    part of its ongoing business operations. Management uses
    derivative financial and commodity instruments, where
    appropriate, to manage these risks. In general, instruments used
    as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk associated with
    the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at
    the inception of the contract. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, the Company designates derivatives as
    cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges, or
    other contracts used to reduce volatility in the translation of
    foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars. The fair values
    of all hedges are recorded in accounts receivable, other assets,
    other current liabilities and other liabilities. Gains and
    losses representing either hedge ineffectiveness, hedge
    components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or
    hedges of translational exposure are recorded in other income
    (expense), net. Within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,
    settlements of cash flow and fair value hedges are classified as
    an operating activity; settlements of all other derivatives are
    classified as a financing activity.

Cash
    flow hedges

Qualifying derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges
    when the hedged item is a forecasted transaction. Gains and
    losses on these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive
    income until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings.
    When the hedged item is realized, gains or losses are
    reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the
    Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the same line item as the
    underlying transaction. For all cash flow hedges, gains and
    losses representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge
    components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness were
    insignificant during the periods presented.

The cumulative net loss attributable to cash flow hedges
    recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at
    January 3, 2009, was $24 million, related to forward
    interest rate contracts settled during 2001 and 2003 in
    conjunction with fixed rate long-term debt issuances,

10-year

natural gas price swaps entered into in 2006, and commodity
    price cash flow hedges, partially offset by gains on foreign
    currency cash flow hedges. The interest rate contract losses
    will be reclassified into interest expense over the next
    23 years. The natural gas swap losses will be reclassified
    to cost of goods sold over the next 8 years. Gains and
    losses related to foreign currency and commodity price cash flow
    hedges will be reclassified into earnings during the next
    18 months.

Fair
    value hedges

Qualifying derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges
    when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm
    commitment. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded
    in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. For
    all fair value hedges, gains and losses representing either
    hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the
    assessment of effectiveness were insignificant during the
    periods presented.

Net
    investment hedges

Qualifying derivative and nonderivative financial instruments
    are accounted for as net investment hedges when the hedged item
    is a nonfunctional currency investment in a subsidiary. Gains
    and losses on these instruments are included in foreign currency
    translation adjustments in other comprehensive income.



Other
    contracts

The Company also periodically enters into foreign currency
    forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in the
    translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars.
    Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in other
    income (expense), net, generally reducing the exposure to
    translation volatility during a full-year period.

Foreign
    exchange risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash
    flows related primarily to third-party purchases, intercompany
    transactions and nonfunctional currency denominated third-party
    debt. The Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value
    of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows
    related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, the
    Company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign
    currency earnings to U.S. dollars. Management assesses
    foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and
    translational volatility and enters into forward contracts,
    options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long
    or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are
    generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap
    agreements are established in conjunction with the term of
    underlying debt issues.

For foreign currency cash flow and fair value hedges, the
    assessment of effectiveness is generally based on changes in
    spot rates. Changes in time value are reported in other income
    (expense), net.

Interest
    rate risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard
    to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of
    variable rate debt. The Company periodically uses interest rate
    swaps, including forward-starting swaps, to reduce interest rate
    volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt
    issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus
    fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market
    conditions.

Variable-to-fixed

interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and
    the assessment of effectiveness is based on changes in the
    present value of interest payments on the underlying debt.

Fixed-to-variable

interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and
    the assessment of effectiveness is based on changes in the fair
    value of the underlying debt, using incremental borrowing rates
    currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities.

Price
    risk

The Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a
    result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials,
    fuel, and energy. The Company has historically used the
    combination of long-term contracts with suppliers, and
    exchange-traded futures and option contracts to reduce price
    fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material
    purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months.
    During 2006, the Company entered into two separate

10-year

over-the-counter

commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price
    of natural gas used principally in its manufacturing processes.

Commodity contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
    assessment of effectiveness for exchange-traded instruments is
    based on changes in futures prices. The assessment of
    effectiveness for

over-the-counter

transactions is based on changes in designated indexes.

Credit
    risk concentration

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by counterparties on derivative financial and
    commodity contracts. This credit loss is limited to the cost of
    replacing these contracts at current market rates. In some
    instances the Company has reciprocal collateralization
    agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in
    excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the
    posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities
    or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the
    Company or its counterparties exceeds a certain amount. There
    were no collateral balance requirements at January 3, 2009
    or December 29, 2007.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash
    equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company places its
    investments in highly rated financial institutions and
    investment-grade short-term debt instruments, and limits the
    amount of credit exposure to any one entity. Management believes
    concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts
    receivable is limited due to the generally high credit quality
    of the Company’s major customers, as well as the large
    number and geographic dispersion of smaller customers. However,
    the Company conducts a disproportionate amount of business with
    a small number of large multinational grocery retailers, with
    the five largest accounts comprising approximately 30% of
    consolidated accounts receivable at January 3, 2009.

NOTE 13

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” was
    adopted by the Company as of the beginning of its 2008 fiscal
    year, as discussed in Note 1 herein. As required by
    SFAS No. 157, the Company has categorized its
    financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value
    hierarchy, based on the nature of the inputs used in determining
    fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (level 3). Following is a description of each



category in the fair value hierarchy and the financial assets
    and liabilities of the Company that are included in each
    category at January 3, 2009.

Level 1

— Financial assets and liabilities
    whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in an active market. For the Company,
    level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily
    of commodity derivative contracts.

Level 2

— Financial assets and liabilities
    whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not
    active or model inputs that are observable either directly or
    indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or
    liability. For the Company, level 2 financial assets and
    liabilities consist of interest rate swaps and

over-the-counter

commodity and currency contracts.

The Company’s calculation of the fair value of interest
    rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based
    on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.
    Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based
    on the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied
    by the notional amount. Foreign currency contracts are valued
    using an income approach based on forward rates less the
    contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.

Level 3 —

Financial assets and liabilities
    whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that
    require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the
    overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect
    management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market
    participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The
    Company does not have any level 3 financial assets or
    liabilities.

The following table presents the Company’s fair value
    hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair
    value on a recurring basis as of January 3, 2009:

CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims
    in the ordinary course of business covering matters such as
    general commercial, governmental regulations, antitrust and
    trade regulations, product liability, intellectual property,
    employment and other actions. Management has determined that the
    ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or
    results of operations.

NOTE 15

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On January 14, 2009, the Company announced a precautionary
    hold on certain

Austin

and

Keebler

branded peanut
    butter sandwich crackers and certain

Famous Amos

and

Keebler

branded peanut butter cookies while the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other authorities
    investigated Peanut Corporation of America (“PCA”),
    one of Kellogg’s peanut paste suppliers for the cracker and
    cookie products. On January 16, 2009, Kellogg voluntarily
    recalled those products because the paste ingredients supplied
    to Kellogg had the potential to be contaminated with salmonella.
    The recall was expanded on January 31, February 2 and
    February 17, 2009 to include certain

Bear Naked

,

Kashi

and

Special K

products impacted by PCA
    ingredients.

The Company has incurred costs associated with the recalls and
    in accordance with U.S. GAAP recorded certain items
    associated with this subsequent event in its fiscal year 2008
    financial results.

The charges associated with the recalls reduced North America
    full-year 2008 operating profit by $34 million or $0.06
    EPS. Of the total charges, $12 million related to estimated
    customer returns and consumer rebates and was recorded as a
    reduction to net sales; $21 million related to costs
    associated with returned product and the disposal and write-off
    of inventory which was recorded as cost of goods sold; and
    $1 million related to other costs which were recorded as
    SGA expense.

Management’s
    Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    notes. We believe that the consolidated financial statements
    present the Company’s financial position and results of
    operations in conformity with accounting principles that are
    generally accepted in the United States, using our best
    estimates and judgments as required.

The independent registered public accounting firm audits the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board and provides an objective, independent review of the
    fairness of reported operating results and financial position.

The Board of Directors of the Company has an Audit Committee
    composed of five non-management Directors. The Committee meets
    regularly with management, internal auditors, and the
    independent registered public accounting firm to review
    accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting
    matters.

Formal policies and procedures, including an active Ethics and
    Business Conduct program, support the internal controls and are
    designed to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of
    personal and professional integrity. We have a rigorous internal
    audit program that independently evaluates the adequacy and
    effectiveness of these internal controls.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for designing, maintaining and
    evaluating adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our
    internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework, management concluded
    that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    as of January 3, 2009. The effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2009 has
    been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which follows.

Executive Vice President,

Chief Financial Officer



Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the
    Shareholders and Board of Directors of

Kellogg Company

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Kellogg Company
    and its subsidiaries at January 3, 2009 and
    December 29, 2007, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    January 3, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    January 3, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
    on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for defined benefit pension, other postretirement and
    postemployment plans in 2006. Also, as discussed in Note 1
    to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
    the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions in
    2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9. CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a) We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
    our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure under

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e).

Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, rather than absolute,
    assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

As of January 3, 2009, management carried out an evaluation
    under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
    Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
    reasonable assurance level.

(b) Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002, we have included a report of management’s
    assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as part of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

The independent registered public accounting firm of
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also attested to, and reported on,
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting. Management’s report and the independent
    registered public accounting firm’s attestation report are
    included in our 2008 financial statements in Item 8 of this
    Report under the captions entitled “Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” and
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm” and are incorporated herein by reference.

(c) During the last fiscal quarter, there have been no
    changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
