PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

The Company.

Kellogg Company, founded
in 1906 and incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and marketing of ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods.

The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek, Michigan 49016-3599. Unless otherwise specified or indicated by the context,
“Kellogg,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Kellogg Company, its divisions and subsidiaries.

Financial Information About Segments.

Information on segments is located in Note 16 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Principal
Products.

Our principal products are ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, such as cookies, crackers, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks, frozen waffles
and veggie foods. These products were, as of February 26, 2013, manufactured by us in 18 countries and marketed in more than 180 countries. Our cereal products are generally marketed under the

Kellogg’s

name and are sold to
the grocery trade through direct sales forces for resale to consumers. We use broker and distributor arrangements for certain products. We also generally use these, or similar arrangements, in less-developed market areas or in those market areas
outside of our focus.

We also market cookies, crackers, crisps, and other convenience foods, under brands such as

Kellogg’s, Keebler,
Cheez-It, Murray, Austin

and

Famous Amos,

to supermarkets in the United States through a direct store-door (DSD) delivery system, although other distribution methods are also used.

Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of our products for the years 2010 through 2012 is located in Note 16 within Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8.

Raw
Materials.

Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, soy bean oil, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the
principal packaging materials used by us. We continually monitor world supplies and prices of such commodities (which include such packaging materials), as well as government trade policies. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to
government policy and regulation, weather conditions, climate change or other unforeseen circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes of our short-term and long-term
requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the United States include corn grits, wheat and wheat derivatives, oats,
rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners, flour, vegetable oils, dairy products, eggs, and other filling ingredients, which are obtained from various sources. Most of these commodities are purchased
principally from sources in the United States.

We enter into long-term contracts for the commodities described in this section and purchase these
items on the open market, depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and our relative negotiating power. While the cost of some of these commodities has, and may continue to, increase over time, we believe that we will be
able to purchase an adequate supply of these items as needed. As further discussed herein under Part II, Item 7A, we also use commodity futures and options to hedge some of our costs.

Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based operations are available in adequate supply and are sometimes imported from countries other than those
where used in manufacturing.

Natural gas and propane are the primary sources of energy used to power processing ovens at major domestic and
international facilities, although certain locations may use oil or propane on a back-up or alternative basis. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. As further discussed herein
under Part II, Item 7A, we use over-the-counter commodity price swaps to hedge some of our natural gas costs.

Trademarks and Technology.

Generally, our products are marketed under trademarks we own. Our principal trademarks are our
housemarks, brand names, slogans, and designs related to cereals and convenience foods manufactured and marketed by us, and we also grant licenses to third parties to use these marks on various goods. These trademarks include

used in connection with potato crisps are also important
Kellogg trademarks.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when taken as a whole, are important to our business. Certain individual trademarks are
also important to our business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of
trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use.

We consider that, taken as a whole, the rights under our
various patents, which expire from time to time, are a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Our activities under licenses or other franchises or
concessions which we hold are similarly a valuable asset, but are not believed to be material.

Seasonality.

Demand for our products has generally been approximately level throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods
have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and holidays. We also custom-bake cookies for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., which are principally sold in the first quarter of the year.


Working Capital.

Although terms vary around the world and by business types, in the United States we generally have required payment for goods sold eleven or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as 2% 10/net 11 or
1% 15/net 16. Receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide for our payment of dividends, repurchases of our common stock, capital expansion, and for other operating expenses and working capital needs.

Customers.

Our largest customer,
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated net sales during 2012, comprised principally of sales within the United States. At December 29, 2012, approximately 18% of our consolidated receivables
balance and 26% of our U.S. receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2012. During 2012, our top five customers, collectively,
including Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 45% of U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and we believe that this trend
is likely to continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our
products and our relationships with our customers. Our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and
other food service establishments.

Backlog.

For the most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at December 29, 2012 and
December 31, 2011 was not material to us.

Competition.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories, both domestically and internationally. Our products
compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food products. Principal methods and factors of
competition include new product introductions, product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price, advertising and promotion.

Research and Development.

Research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is carried on
at the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at other locations around the world. Our expenditures for research and development were approximately (in millions): 2012-$206; 2011-$192; 2010-$187.

Regulation.

Our activities
in the United States are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other
bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United States, including those of the European Union and various countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our activities.

Environmental Matters.

Our
facilities are subject to various U.S. and foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material
proceedings arising under these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position.

Employees.

At December 29, 2012,
we had approximately 31,000 employees.

Financial Information About Geographic
Areas.

Information on geographic areas is located in Note 16 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8.

below. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them.


ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks
and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.

Our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, including agricultural commodities, fuel and labor.

Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard,
corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, climate change or other unforeseen circumstances. To the extent
that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes, the results of our operations could be
materially and adversely affected. In addition, we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials. Our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase, resulting in an unfavorable impact on
both gross margin and net earnings.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or
propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Short-term stand-by propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies. Oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at
various plants. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or
other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.

A shortage in
the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.

Additionally, our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States
and various foreign locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active health care, severance and other postemployment benefits. We also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations.
Our major pension plans and U.S. retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. The annual cost
of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount rate used to measure obligations, the
rate or trend of health care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.

Our operations face significant
foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results.

We hold assets and incur
liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and Russian ruble. Because our
consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, changes in the value of the
U.S. dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.

If our food products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result.

Selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration.
We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded. We may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. A widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in
significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. For example, in October 2012, we initiated a recall of certain packages of

Mini-Wheats

cereal due to the possible presence of fragments of flexible metal mesh from a faulty manufacturing part. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case
could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. Moreover, even if a product
liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or


processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands.

We could also be adversely affected if
consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our
products or cause production and delivery disruptions.

Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our ability, including manufacturing or distribution capabilities, and that of our suppliers, business
partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change,
natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, or other reasons, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood
or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.

Evolving tax, environmental, food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, labeling, trade, food
quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.

Our activities,
both in and outside of the United States, are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Federal Trade Commission,
the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as similar and other authorities of the European Union, International Accords and Treaties and others, including voluntary regulation by other bodies. The manufacturing, marketing
and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements. Those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety, ingredients, advertising, labeling, relations with
distributors and retailers, health and safety and the environment. We are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, tax and environmental matters. The need to comply with new or revised tax,
environmental, food quality and safety or other laws or regulations, or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, if we are
found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or permits, or recalls, as well as potential criminal
sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations, it could potentially create negative publicity which could harm our business or reputation.

If we pursue strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions
or successfully integrate acquired businesses.

From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures
that would further our strategic objectives. With respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of
integration challenges. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our
strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges. Companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the
investments made. Our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, and
adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization
expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Our profits earned outside the U.S. are generally taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rates. The cash we generate outside the U.S. is principally to be
used to fund our international development. If the funds generated by our U.S. business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the U.S., we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the U.S. Such international
earnings would be subject to U.S. tax which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase.


We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net
worth, property, withholding and franchise taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to such
income and non-income based taxes inside and outside of the U.S. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and
penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

The enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in markets in which we are currently
active or may be active in the future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.

We may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Pringles acquisition or in the expected time frame.

The overall success of the Pringles acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining and integrating the Pringles business into our existing
business. We may not be able to fully achieve these objectives, or may not be able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, and the anticipated future benefits and synergies therefore may not be realized fully or at all. We may also incur
unanticipated costs. The acquisition involves challenges and risks, including risks that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or that we will not realize a satisfactory return. Any integration difficulties could decrease or
eliminate the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Pringles acquisition and could negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results.

Our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes.

There are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole. These include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products.

Our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response
to such changes. We aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote significant focus to the development of new
products and to the research, development and technology process functions of our business, we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. Our future results and our ability to maintain or
improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets.

We operate in the highly competitive food industry.

We face competition across our product lines, including ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions. Most of our
competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share, any
of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business.

There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil, criminal or regulatory actions, including under general, commercial, employment, environmental, food quality and safety, anti-trust
and trade, and environmental laws and regulations, or in asserting its rights under various laws. In addition, we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal
requirements. The costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us, and new legal requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness.

We have
indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity. As of December 29, 2012, we had total debt of approximately $7.9 billion and total Kellogg Company equity of $2.4 billion.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including:

•

impairing the ability to access global capital markets to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate


purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward or if a rating organization announces that our ratings are under review for a
potential downgrade;

•

A downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly our short-term credit rating, would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue, increase our
commercial paper borrowing costs, or both;

•

restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or
our business;

•

requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds
available to us for other purposes such as expansion through acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchasing shares, marketing spending and expansion of our product offerings; and

•

causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which
in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions, the availability of, and interest rates on, short-term financing, and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.

Our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies.

Customer and
consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions, or other economic downturns in the United States or other nations. Our results in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be,
materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the United States and other countries, including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business, the financial markets through which we access capital and
currency, political unrest and terrorist acts in the United States or other countries in which we carry on business.

Current economic conditions
globally, particularly in Europe may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers. This could result in reductions in sales of our products, reduced acceptance of innovations, and increased price competition. Deterioration in
economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Financial institutions may be negatively impacted
by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and increased volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity
markets. There could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business, which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers, including our suppliers, co-manufacturers and
distributors. A disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management. Any of these events would likely harm our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail
environment. In addition, the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated net sales during 2012, comprised principally of sales within the United States. At December 29, 2012, approximately 18% of our consolidated receivables balance and
26% of our U.S. receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2012. During 2012, our top five customers, collectively, including
Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 45% of U.S. net sales. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger, our large retail customers may seek to use
their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our
profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. The loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits.

An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.

The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The
carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, trade names, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are
not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. If carrying value exceeds current fair


value, the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings. Events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in
which we operate, including competition and advances in technology; a significant product liability or intellectual property claim; or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability. Should the value of one or more of the
acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected.

As of December 29, 2012, the
carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately $7.4 billion, of which $5.0 billion was goodwill and $2.4 billion represented trademarks, tradenames, and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of
$15.2 billion and total Kellogg Company equity of $2.4 billion.

Our postretirement benefit-related costs and funding requirements could
increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions.

Increases in the costs of
postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation, the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond
markets on the performance of our pension and post-retirement plan assets, potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations, and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected
return on pension and post-retirement plan assets assumptions. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial
markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. The Company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly those due
to the change in the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets and interest rates. In addition, funding requirements for our plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among
other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and post-retirement funding obligations.

Multiemployer Pension Plans could adversely affect our business.

We participate in various
“multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Our required
contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their
withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum
contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the
extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits. In the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan, and in that
event, we could face a withdrawal liability. Some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities. Such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability.

Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.

Retailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products. Consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to
consumers at the right price. It is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in quality between our products and those of store brands narrows, or if such difference
in quality is perceived to have narrowed, then consumers may not buy our products. Furthermore, during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of our
higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings. If we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image, it could have a material effect on our market share and our profitability.

We may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives.

Our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. We have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities. Ongoing
operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production, procurement, or logistical changes and these, as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our
business and consolidated financial position and


on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.

Technology failures could
disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.

We increasingly rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store
electronic information. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between our
personnel, customers, and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, as a result of updating our SAP platform or due to events beyond our control, including, but
not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. Moreover, our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other
malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks. These events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including
remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions
to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems.

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing
agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third party
nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our technology, or any change in law or
other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.

We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands or products. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and
time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be
subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.

Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers
do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.

We have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually
enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality
products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the
quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, Kellogg and third parties
increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about Kellogg, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do
not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted.

COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate
headquarters and principal research and development facilities are located in Battle Creek, Michigan.

We operated, as of February 26, 2013,
manufacturing plants and distribution and warehousing facilities totaling more than 30 million square feet of building area in the United States and other countries. Our plants have been designed and constructed to meet our specific production
requirements, and we periodically invest money for capital and technological improvements. At the time of its selection, each location was considered to be favorable, based on the location of markets, sources of raw materials, availability of
suitable labor, transportation facilities, location of our other plants producing similar products, and other factors. Our manufacturing


facilities in the United States include four cereal plants and warehouses located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska and other plants or
facilities in San Jose, California; Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, and Rome, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Seelyville, Indiana; Kansas City, Kansas; Florence, Louisville, and Pikeville, Kentucky; Grand Rapids and Wyoming, Michigan; Blue Anchor, New
Jersey; Cary and Charlotte, North Carolina; Cincinnati and Zanesville, Ohio; Muncy, Pennsylvania; Jackson and Rossville, Tennessee; Clearfield, Utah; and Allyn, Washington.

Outside the United States, we had, as of February 26, 2013, additional manufacturing locations, some with warehousing facilities, in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Germany, Great
Britain, India, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and Venezuela.

We generally own our principal properties,
including our major office facilities, although some manufacturing facilities are leased, and no owned property is subject to any major lien or other encumbrance. Distribution facilities (including related warehousing facilities) and offices of
non-plant locations typically are leased. In general, we consider our facilities, taken as a whole, to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient capacity for our current operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and
governmental inspections, audits or investigations arising out of our business which cover matters such as general commercial, governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability, environmental, intellectual property,
employment and other actions. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Information on the market for our common stock, number of shareowners and dividends is located in Note 15 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

On April 23, 2010, our board of directors authorized a $2.5 billion three-year share repurchase program for 2010 through 2012 for general
corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs. During 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 1 million shares for a total of $63 million.

On December 7, 2012, our board of directors authorized a $300 million repurchase program for 2013. In connection with the acquisition of the Pringles business, we expect to limit our share repurchases to
proceeds received by us from employee option exercises during 2013.

The following table provides information with respect to purchases of common shares
under programs authorized by our board of directors during the quarter ended December 29, 2012.


ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated
Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report.

For more than 100 years, consumers have counted on
Kellogg for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. Kellogg is the world’s leading producer of cereal, second largest producer of cookies and crackers, and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods. Additional product
offerings include toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally.

We
manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location. These operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or
classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments. We report results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi; U.S.
Snacks; U.S. Specialty; North America Other; Europe; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long-term annual growth targets. These targets are 3 to 4% for internal net sales,
mid-single-digit (4 to 6%) for underlying operating profit, and high-single-digit (7 to 9%) for currency neutral underlying diluted net earnings per share.

Internal net sales growth and internal operating profit growth exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and, if applicable, acquisitions, dispositions and transaction and integration costs associated with
the acquisition of the

Pringles

®

business (Pringles). In addition to these items, internal operating profit growth
also includes the benefit of allocating a portion of costs related to our support functions that are now being leveraged to provide support to the Pringles business.

As a result of adopting the accounting change discussed below, comparability of certain financial measures is impacted significantly by the mark-to-market adjustments that are recorded annually, or more frequently
if a re-measurement event occurs. To provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our underlying operating performance we use non-GAAP financial measures within the MD&A that exclude the impact of mark-to-market adjustments. These
non-GAAP financial measures include underlying gross margin, underlying gross profit, underlying SGA%, underlying operating margin, underlying operating profit, underlying operating profit growth, underlying income taxes, underlying net income
attributable to Kellogg Company, underlying basic earnings per share (EPS), underlying diluted EPS, and underlying diluted EPS growth. Underlying operating profit growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, mark-to-market
adjustments, and, if applicable, acquisitions, dispositions, and transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the Pringles business.

During 2012 we completed the acquisition of the Pringles business from The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) for $2.668 billion, including working capital adjustments, which was funded from cash-on-hand
and the issuance of $2.3 billion of short and long-term debt.

In the fourth quarter of 2012 we changed our accounting for recognizing expense for our
pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Historically we deferred actuarial gains and losses from these plans and recognized the financial impact to the income statement over several years. Under the new accounting method, gains and losses from
these plans are recognized in an annual mark-to-market adjustment that is recorded in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if a re-measurement event occurs earlier in the year.

Concurrent with the accounting change, we have elected to modify the allocation of pension and post-retirement benefit plan costs to reportable segments. Historically all costs for these plans were allocated to
reportable segments for management evaluation and reporting purposes. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we have included the service cost of these plans within the financial results of the reportable segments. All other costs related to these
plans, such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and the annual mark-to-market adjustment will be reported in Corporate.

These changes
have been applied retrospectively. Financial results from prior periods have been recast to include the impact as if the changes had been in place during those periods. Refer to Note 1 within Notes to


Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this accounting change.

For
the full year 2012, our reported net sales, which includes the impact of the operating results of the Pringles business since the acquisition on May 31, 2012, increased by 7.6% and internal net sales increased by 2.5%, in line with our
expectations. We experienced solid growth in North America, Latin America, and most of Asia Pacific. Operating environments in Europe continued to be difficult, although we are seeing continued improvement in sales trends for the segment. Reported
operating profit, which includes the impact of the accounting change, the operating results of the Pringles business, and transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Pringles, increased by 9.5%. Underlying operating profit
declined by 5.7%, in line with our expectations, and was unfavorably impacted by anticipated cost inflation, the impact of the third quarter’s limited recall, and increased brand-building investment. Diluted EPS of $2.67, was up 12.2% compared
to the prior year EPS of $2.38. Underlying EPS of $3.52 was in line with our expectations.

Reconciliation of certain non-GAAP
Financial Measures

(a)

Internal net sales growth for 2012 excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, integration costs, and currency. Internal net sales growth for 2011 excludes the impact of
currency. Internal net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure further discussed and reconciled to the directly comparable measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the net sales and operating profit section.

(b)

Actuarial gains/losses are recognized in the year they occur. In 2012, asset returns exceeded expectations but discount rates fell almost 100 basis points resulting in a net
loss. The loss in 2011 resulted from actual asset returns being less than expected and a decline in discount rates. The loss in 2010 resulted from a decline in discount rates which was partially offset by better than expected asset returns.

(c)

Underlying operating profit, underlying operating profit growth, underlying income taxes, underlying net income attributable to Kellogg Company, underlying basic EPS, underlying
basic EPS growth, underlying diluted EPS, and underlying diluted EPS growth are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of pension and post-retirement benefit plans mark-to-market adjustments. Underlying operating profit growth excludes the impact

Internal net sales for U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi increased 2.7%
as a result of favorable pricing/mix and approximately flat volume. This business has two product groups: cereal and select snacks. Cereal’s internal net sales increased by 2.4% resulting from strong innovation launches and increased investment
in brand-building supporting brands such as

Frosted Flakes

®

. Snacks (toaster pastries, Kashi-branded cereal bars,
crackers, cookies, Stretch Island fruit snacks, and health and wellness products) internal net sales increased by 3.4% as a result of solid growth in the toaster pastries and health and wellness businesses.

Internal net sales in U.S. Snacks increased by 1.9% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and a slight decline in volume. This business consists of cookies,
crackers, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and Pringles. The sales growth was the result of strong crackers consumption behind the launch of

innovation.
Sales declined in cereal bars versus a difficult year-ago comparison while

Special K

®

bars continued strong growth
behind innovations. Cookies sales were flat versus a difficult year-ago comparison.

Internal net sales in U.S. Specialty increased by 7.4% as a result
of favorable pricing/mix and volume. Sales growth was due to strong results from innovation launches and expanded points of distribution.


Internal net sales in North America Other (U.S. Frozen and Canada) increased by 7.0% due to favorable pricing/mix and
volume. Sales growth was the result of our U.S. Frozen business posting double-digit growth for the year while gaining share as a result of increased brand-building support behind innovation activity.

Europe’s internal net sales declined 3.8% for the year driven by a decline in volume, partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. The operating environment in
Europe continued to be difficult as a result of economic conditions and competitive activity although we are experiencing continued improvement in sales trends. Latin America’s internal net sales growth was 6.7% due to a strong increase in
pricing/mix partially offset by a decline in volume. Latin America experienced growth in both cereal and snacks behind an increase in brand-building investment to support innovations. Growth was broad-based across nearly every market in the segment.
Internal net sales in Asia Pacific grew 2.7% as a result of favorable volume partially offset by unfavorable pricing/mix. Asia Pacific’s growth was driven by solid performance across most of Asia, as well as South Africa. Australia posted a
slight decline in sales, but experienced continued improvement throughout the year, while gaining share in both the cereal and snacks categories.

The
third quarter recall impacted internal operating profit growth as follows: Kellogg Consolidated – (1.8%), U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi – (3.1%), U.S.

Specialty – (1.6%), North America Other – (1.4%).

Internal operating profit in U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi declined by 2.7%, U.S. Snacks declined by 0.8%, U.S. Specialty increased by 1.2%, North America Other grew by 5.2%, Europe declined by 15.8%, Latin
America declined by 3.7% and Asia Pacific declined by 28.7%. U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi’s decline was attributable to the impact of the third-quarter recall and increased commodity costs, partially offset by sales growth in cereal and
snacks. U.S. Snacks’ decline was attributable to cost inflation and a double-digit increase in brand-building investments. U.S. Specialty’s increase was attributable to strong sales growth being partially offset by increased commodity
costs and a double-digit increase in brand-building investment. North America Other’s increase was attributable to strong sales growth being partially offset by increased commodity costs and a double-digit increase in brand-building investment.
Europe’s operating profit declined due to lower sales resulting from the continued difficult operating environment and increased commodity costs, partially offset by reduced brand-building investment. The decline in Latin America’s
operating profit was due to cost inflation and increased brand-building investment more than offsetting the impact of higher sales. Asia Pacific’s operating profit decline was due to cost inflation, charges related to the closure of a plant in
Australia, and increased brand-building investment more than offsetting the impact of higher sales. Refer to Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Australian plant closure.

2011 compared to 2010

The following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2011 versus 2010 for our reportable segments:

(a)

Internal net sales and operating profit growth for 2011 and 2010 exclude the impact of currency. Internal net sales and operating profit growth are non-GAAP financial measures
which are reconciled to the directly comparable measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP within these tables.

Internal net sales for U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi increased 4.3% as a result of
favorable pricing/mix and approximately flat volume. This business has two product groups: cereal and select snacks. Cereal’s internal net sales increased by 5% resulting from strong innovation launches and reduced reliance on promotional
spending. Dollar sales from our innovation in 2011 equaled the dollar sales from innovation introduced by all our competitors combined. Snacks (toaster pastries, Kashi-branded cereal bars, crackers, cookies, Stretch Island fruit snacks, and health
and wellness products) internal net sales increased by 3% as a result of double-digit growth in health and wellness and continued share gains in our

Pop-Tarts

business.

Internal net sales in U.S. Snacks
increased by 6.6% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and approximately flat volume. This business consists of cookies, crackers, cereal bars, and fruit-flavored snacks. The sales growth was the result of strong crackers consumption behind the
launch of

Special K Cracker Chips

®

and

Cheez-it

®

innovation which contributed to a solid improvement in our cracker category share. Sales also improved in wholesome snacks as a result of innovations in our

Special K

cereal bars business. Cookies low-single digit sales growth was favorably impacted by the launch of the

Keebler

®

master brand initiative in the second quarter which aligned pricing, packaging and scale across the

Keebler

brand.

Internal net sales in U.S. Specialty increased by 3.4% as
a result of favorable pricing/mix and approximately flat volume. Sales growth was due to frozen food innovation launches and cereal bar distribution gains.

Internal net sales in North America Other (U.S. Frozen and Canada) increased by 6.4% due to mid-single-digit volume growth and favorable pricing/mix. Sales growth was the result of our U.S. Frozen business posting
double-digit growth for the year while gaining share as a result of increased brand-building support behind innovation activity.

Europe’s internal
net sales declined 0.7% for the year driven by a decline in volume, partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. The operating environment in Europe continued to be difficult as a result of economic conditions and competitive activity. Sales growth in
Russia was solid, as we continue to transition from a non-branded to a branded product mix. Latin America’s internal net sales growth was 10.3% due to a slight increase in volume and double-digit increase in pricing/mix. Latin America
experienced growth in both cereal and snacks behind a mid-double-digit increase in brand-building investment to support innovations. Internal net sales in Asia Pacific grew 4.1% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and approximately flat volume.
Asia Pacific’s growth was driven by strong performance across most of Asia, as well as South Africa.

Internal operating profit in U.S. Morning
Foods & Kashi declined by 1.6%, U.S. Snacks declined by 8.1%, U.S. Specialty declined by 8.7%, North America Other grew by 9.5%, Europe declined by 16.1%, Latin America increased by 8.5% and Asia Pacific increased by 34.8%. U.S. Morning
Foods & Kashi’s decline was attributable to strong sales in cereal and snacks, being offset by increased incentive compensation expense, increased commodity costs and investments in supply chain. U.S. Snacks’ decline was
attributable to investments in supply chain and increased incentive compensation expense. U.S. Specialty’s decline was attributable to increased commodity costs and incentive compensation expense. Europe’s operating profit declined due to
lower sales resulting from the continued difficult operating environment and increased commodity costs. The increase in Latin America’s operating profit is primarily a result of higher sales partially offset by increased brand-building
investment. Asia Pacific’s operating profit growth was positively impacted by the prior year impairment charges related to our business in China. Refer to Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the
China impairment.

Corporate Expense

(dollars in millions)




Operating profit

$

(521

Corporate expense is primarily the result of mark-to-market adjustments for our pension and non-pension post-retirement benefit
plans. These adjustments were $(452), $(682), and $(9) in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The remaining changes were the result of impacts from compensation-related expense and pension-related interest cost and offsetting pension-related
expected return on plan assets.

Margin performance

Margin performance was as follows:


(a)

Reported gross margin as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold.

(b)

Actuarial gains/losses are recognized in the year they occur. In 2012, asset returns exceeded expectations but discount rates fell almost 100 basis points resulting in a net
loss. The loss in 2011 resulted from actual asset returns being less than expected and a decline in discount rates. The loss in 2010 resulted from a decline in discount rates which was partially offset by better than expected asset returns.

(c)

Underlying gross margin, underlying SGA%, and underlying operating margin are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of pension and post-retirement benefit plans
mark-to-market adjustments. We believe the use of such non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists in understanding our underlying operating performance.

Underlying gross margin, which excludes the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on pension and post-retirement benefit plans, declined by 180 basis points in 2012 as a result of cost inflation and the lower margin
structure of the Pringles business, which was partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives. Underlying SGA %, which excludes the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on pension and post-retirement benefit plans, was consistent with
2011.

Underlying gross margin declined by 110 basis points in 2011 due to the expanded investments in our supply chain, and increased cost pressures
for fuel, energy, and commodities, which were partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives. Underlying SGA % decreased by 60 basis points primarily due to a reduction in brand-building investment as a percent of net sales and
decreased costs related to cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense.

Our underlying gross profit,
underlying SGA, and underlying operating profit measures are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure as follows:

(a)

Gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold.

(b)

Actuarial gains/losses are recognized in the year they occur. In 2012, asset returns exceeded expectations but discount rates fell almost 100 basis points resulting in a net
loss. The loss in 2011 resulted from actual asset returns being less than expected and a decline in discount rates. The loss in 2010 resulted from a decline in discount rates which was partially offset by better than expected asset returns.

(c)

Underlying gross profit, underlying SGA, and underlying operating profit are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of pension and post-retirement benefit plans mark-to-market
adjustments. We believe the use of such non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists in understanding our underlying operating performance.

Foreign currency translation

The reporting currency for our financial statements is the
U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the Euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. To prepare our
consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these
other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the
value of the U.S. dollar is substantial.

Interest expense

Annual interest expense is illustrated in the following table. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to increased debt levels associated with the acquisition of Pringles, partially offset by lower interest rates
on our long-term debt. The decline from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to lower interest rates on our long-term debt. Interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was (in millions), 2012-$9; 2011-$11; 2010-$6. We currently expect that
our 2013 gross interest expense will be approximately $230 to $240 million.

Income taxes

Our reported effective tax rates for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 27.4%, 27.0% and 28.5% respectively. Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market adjustment, underlying
effective tax rates for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 28.8%, 29.3%, and 28.9%, respectively. The impact of discrete adjustments reduced our effective income tax rate by 3 percentage points for 2012. The 2012 effective income tax rate benefited from the
elimination of a tax liability related to certain international earnings now considered indefinitely reinvested. For 2011 and 2010 the impact was a reduction of 5 and 3 percentage points,


respectively. Refer to Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective
income tax rate as it is dependent upon U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates. Additionally, the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including
tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and
provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.

We believe that our operating cash flows, together with
our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and
credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

As of December 29, 2012, we had
$244 million of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations.

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:

Operating activities

The principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.

Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2012 amounted to $1,758 million, an increase of $163 million compared with 2011. The increase compared to
the prior year is primarily due to improved performance in working capital resulting from the benefit derived from the Pringles acquisition. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 amounted to $1,595 million, an increase of $587
million compared with 2010, reflecting lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and lower payments for incentive compensation partially offset by a marginal increase in core working capital in 2011.

Our cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a
trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 30 days for 2012, 24 days for 2011 and 23 days for 2010. Core working capital in 2012 averaged 7.8% of net sales, compared to 6.9% in 2011 and 6.6% in 2010. During
2012, core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory. During 2011, core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory and higher days of trade receivables. For both 2012 and 2011, higher days of
inventory was necessary to support our new product introductions and to maintain appropriate levels of service while investing in our supply chain infrastructure. In 2011, higher days of trade receivables resulted from strong sales at year-end due
to our innovation launches and

Special K

New Year’s resolution programs.

Our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $51 million, $192 million and $643 million, in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During the
fourth quarter of 2010, we made incremental contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans amounting to $563 million ($467 million, net of tax).

The Pension Protection Act (PPA), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the United States. We believe that we will not be required to make any contributions
under PPA requirements until 2014 or beyond. Our projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average
yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA.

We currently project that we will make total
U.S. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2013 of approximately $60 million. Actual 2013 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit
trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.


We measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We
use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our cash flow metric is reconciled to
the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows:

Year-over-year changes in cash flow (as defined) were driven by improved performance in working capital resulting from the benefit
derived from the Pringles acquisition, as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the three-year period.

Investing activities

Our net cash used in
investing activities for 2012 amounted to $3,245 million, an increase of $2,658 million compared with 2011 primarily attributable to the $2,668 acquisition of Pringles in 2012.

Capital spending in 2012 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure, and to support capacity requirements in certain markets, including Pringles. In addition, we continued the investment in our
information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our SAP platform.

Net cash used in investing activities of
$587 million in 2011 increased by $122 million compared with 2010, reflecting capital projects for our reimplementation and upgrade of our SAP platform and investments in our supply chain.

Cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has decreased to 3.8% in 2012, from 4.5% in 2011, which was an increase from 3.8% in 2010.

Financing activities

In
February 2013, we issued $250 million of two-year floating-rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and $400 million of ten-year 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes. The proceeds from these Notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including, together with cash on
hand, repayment of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% U.S. Dollar Notes due March 2013. The floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 23 basis points, subject to quarterly reset. The Notes
contain customary covenants that limit the ability of Kellogg Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions, as well as a change of control provision.

Our net cash provided by financing activities was $1,317 for 2012, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $957 and $439 for 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The increase in cash provided from financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010, was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of Pringles.

Total debt was $7.9 billion at year-end 2012 and $6.0 billion at year-end 2011.

In March 2012, we entered into
interest rate swaps on our $500 million five-year 1.875% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes due 2016, $500 million ten-year 4.15% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes due 2019 and $500 million of our $750 million seven-year 4.45% fixed rate
U.S. Dollar Notes due 2016. The interest rate swaps effectively converted these Notes from their fixed rates to floating rate obligations through maturity.

In May 2012, we issued $350 million of three-year 1.125% U.S. Dollar Notes, $400 million of five-year 1.75% U.S. Dollar Notes and $700 million of ten-year 3.125% U.S. Dollar Notes, resulting in
aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $1.442 billion. The proceeds of these Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including financing a portion of the acquisition of Pringles.

In May 2012, we issued Cdn. $300 million of two-year 2.10% fixed rate Canadian Dollar Notes, using the proceeds from these Notes for general corporate purposes,
which included repayment of intercompany debt. This repayment resulted in cash available to be used for a portion of the acquisition of Pringles.

In
December 2012, we repaid $750 million five-year 5.125% U.S. Dollar Notes at maturity with commercial paper.

In February 2011, we entered into
interest rate swaps on $200 million of our $750 million seven-year 4.45% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes due 2016. The interest rate swaps effectively converted this portion of the Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through
maturity.

In April 2011, we repaid $945 million ten-year 6.60% U.S. Dollar Notes at maturity with commercial paper.

In May 2011, we issued $400 million of seven-year 3.25% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using the proceeds of $397 million for general corporate purposes and
repayment of commercial paper. During 2011, we


entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $400 million, which effectively converted these Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity.

In November 2011, we issued $500 million of five-year 1.875% fixed rate U. S. Dollar Notes, using the proceeds of $498 million for general corporate purposes and
repayment of commercial paper. During 2012, we entered into interest rate swaps which effectively converted these Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity.

In April 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $2.5 billion during 2010 through 2012. This three year authorization
replaced previous share buyback programs which had authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.1 billion for 2010 and $650 million for 2009.

Under this
program, we repurchased approximately 1 million, 15 million and 21 million shares of common stock for $63 million, $793 million and $1.1 billion during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

In December 2012, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $300 million
during 2013.

We paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.74 per share in 2012, $1.67 per share in 2011 and $1.56 per share in 2010. Total
cash paid for dividends increased by 3.0% in 2012 and 3.4% in 2011.

In March 2011, we entered into an unsecured Four-Year Credit Agreement which allows
us to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion.

Our long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit Kellogg Company and
some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions. Some agreements also contain change in control provisions. However, they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are
dependent on credit ratings. A change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would
continue to have access to our Four-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in March 2015. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.

Capital and credit markets, including commercial paper markets, continued to experience instability and disruption as the U.S. and global economies underwent a
period of extreme uncertainty. Throughout this period of uncertainty, we continued to have access to the U.S., European, and Canadian commercial paper markets. Our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes
in the credit environment.

We monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash
equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.

We are
in compliance with all covenants as of December 29, 2012. We continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our
operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis.


OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

Off-balance sheet arrangements

As of
December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual
obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 29, 2012:

(a)

Includes interest payments on our long-term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps. Interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the LIBOR forward
rate curve as of December 29, 2012.

(b)

The total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling approximately $1 million over the periods presented above.

(c)

Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.

(d)

Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services.
The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year-end 2012, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to
incur. Therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts.

(e)

As of December 29, 2012, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $80 million, of which $21 million, is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. We are not
able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $59 million.

(f)

Other long-term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at year-end 2012 and consist principally of projected
commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. The table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit
plans through 2018 as follows: 2013-$63; 2014-$42; 2015-$50; 2016-$51; 2017-$212; 2018-$166.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Promotional expenditures

Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events,
feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of
these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of
similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments
represent approximately 0.5% of our company’s net sales. However, our company’s total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) represented approximately 40% of 2012 net sales; therefore, it is
likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Property

Long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Management evaluates several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived
asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current


expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For assets to
be held and used, we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long-lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. If the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount
we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses.

At December 29, 2012, we have property, plant and equipment of $3.8 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on our balance sheet. Included in this amount are approximately $19 million of idle assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

We perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process. Our 2012
analysis excluded goodwill and other intangible assets related to the Pringles acquisition on May 31, 2012. Pringles intangible assets will be tested for impairment in the second quarter of 2013.

Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is
based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. For the 2012 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting
units was estimated based on market multiples. Our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash
flows. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units.

Similarly, impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily
on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with
rates used by market participants. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.

We also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows.
Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances,
legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

At December 29, 2012, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $7.4 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001
acquisition of Keebler Foods Company and the 2012 acquisition of Pringles. Within this total, approximately $2.2 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, comprised principally of Keebler and Pringles trademarks.
We currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows. At December 29, 2012, the fair value of
our U.S. Snacks reporting unit, excluding Pringles, exceeded its book value by $2.0 billion. However, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future performance of our business
or a different weighted-average cost of capital in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses. Additionally, we have $60 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of United Bakers in Russia. The percentage of
excess fair value over carrying value of the Russian reporting unit was approximately 30% in 2012 and 2011. If we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and EBITDA in the valuation, this could have resulted in an impairment
loss. For example, if our projection of EBITDA margins had been lower by 200 basis points, this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the Russian reporting unit. Management will continue to monitor
the situation closely.

Retirement benefits

Our company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding
strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We
recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit


plans. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial
assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend
rates, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we elected to change our policy for recognizing expense for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits. Previously, we recognized actuarial gains and losses associated with
benefit obligations in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet upon each plan remeasurement, amortizing them into operating results over the average future service period of active employees in these plans. Under the
new policy, we have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur, eliminating the amortization. Actuarial gains and losses will be recognized annually as of our measurement
date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.

Additionally, for
purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits, we will no longer use the market-related value of plan assets; an averaging technique permitted under generally accepted accounting
principles, but instead will use the fair value of plan assets.

To conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model
expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the
financial markets including consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 69% of our trust assets
globally, currently incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return
annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a
“more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. While our expected rate of return for 2012 of 8.9% was supported by historical
performance and equated to approximately the 62

nd

percentile of our model, we
have elected to lower our expected rate of return to 8.5% in 2013. This reduction is based on the expectation to de-risk the plan investment portfolio over time and as the market allows. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2013 of 8.5%
equates to approximately the 61st percentile expectation of our model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 31% of our
global benefit plan assets.

Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at December 29, 2012, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the
assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2013 benefits expense by approximately $54 million. For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by
the following amounts (in millions): 2012-$211; 2011-$(471); 2010–$246.

To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our
actual claims cost data over a five-year historical period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan
changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our
expectations regarding short-term future trends. In comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 5.4%, our initial trend rate for 2013 of 5.5% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing
claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 0.5% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as
necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at December 29, 2012, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health
care cost trend rates would increase 2013 benefits expense by approximately $13 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of $166 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2013 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from
the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately $9 million and would increase 2013 expense by $0.3 million. Any arising health care claims


cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. The experience gain arising from recognition of 2012 claims experience was approximately $11 million.

To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using Towers Watson’s
proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future
benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of U.S.
high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. The measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent
with our fiscal year end. Accordingly, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year.

Based on consolidated obligations at December 29, 2012, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2013 benefits expense by
approximately $2 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $233 million. All obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.

Despite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and
actual experience. During 2012, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $445 million compared to approximately $737 million in 2011. Of the total net loss recognized in 2012, approximately $656 million was related primarily to
unfavorable changes in the discount rate, offset by approximately $211 million in asset gains during 2012. Of the $737 million net loss recognized in 2011, approximately $266 million was related to unfavorable changes in the discount rate that were
partially offset by the adoption of an Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP) design for prescription drug costs for the U.S. retiree medical plan, and $471 million was related to unfavorable asset performance.

During 2012, we made contributions in the amount of $38 million to Kellogg’s global tax-qualified pension programs. This amount was mostly
non-discretionary. Additionally we contributed $13 million to our retiree medical programs.

Income taxes

Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The
calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. Income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and
taxable in the United States.

We recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that
the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a
greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation
and tax planning. The tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. Significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in
the rate reconciliation table of Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS

Reporting of amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an updated accounting standard which requires companies to present information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive
income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. The updated standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the
updated standard in the first quarter of 2013.

Indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing

In July 2012, the FASB issued an updated accounting standard to allow entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary
to perform the quantitative indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test. Under the updated standard an entity would not be required to perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment,
that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The updated standard is


effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the updated standard in
connection with our impairment evaluations to be completed in the second and fourth quarters of 2013.

FUTURE OUTLOOK

We anticipate 2013 will be a return to our on-going operating model. In recent years we have invested in the business, adjusted our strategy to focus more on
growth, and acquired Pringles. With the foundation that we have set as a result of this work, we expect to realize growth in 2013 through increased investment in advertising and continued investment behind a strong line-up of innovation launches. We
expect reported net sales will increase by approximately 7 percent, gross margin to decline approximately 50 basis points due to the full-year impact of the Pringles business, reported operating profit to grow slightly more than EPS, and reported
EPS to grow by 5 to 7 percent. Projected EPS growth includes a $0.12 to $0.14 impact from Pringles integration costs. This outlook excludes the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on our pension and post-retirement benefit plans as well as
commodity contracts.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative financial and commodity instruments,
where appropriate, to manage these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative financial and
commodity instruments.

Foreign exchange risk

Our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third-party purchases, intercompany transactions, and when applicable, nonfunctional currency denominated third-party debt.
Our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign
currency denominated earnings to U.S. dollars. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and Mexican peso, and in the case of inter-subsidiary transactions, the British
pound versus the euro. We assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts, options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions.
Forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances.

The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year-end 2012 was $570 million, representing a settlement receivable of $1 million. The total notional amount of foreign currency
derivative instruments at year-end 2011 was $1.3 billion, representing a settlement obligation of $7 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions, translational exposure, or existing assets or liabilities, and
mature within 18 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year-end exchange rates, the settlement receivable would have decreased by approximately $57 million at year-end 2012 and the settlement obligation would have increased by
approximately $127 million at year-end 2011. These unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures.

Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly
inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. As of the end of our 2009 fiscal year, we used the parallel rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars. In May 2010, the Venezuelan government effectively
eliminated the parallel market. In June 2010, several large Venezuelan commercial banks began operating the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities (SITME). Accordingly, we began using the SITME rate as of January 1, 2011
to translate our Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars. During 2010, we recorded a $3 million foreign exchange gain in other income (expense), net, associated with the translation of our subsidiary’s financials into
U.S. dollars, with no impact during 2012 or 2011. In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced a 46.5% devaluation of the official exchange rate. Additionally, the SITME was eliminated. Accordingly, in 2013 we will begin using the official
exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollar. On a consolidated basis, Venezuela represents less than 2% of our business; therefore, any ongoing impact is expected to be immaterial.

Interest rate risk

Our Company is exposed
to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and
commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs


associated with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions.

During 2012 and 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain U.S. Dollar Notes. Refer to disclosures contained in Note 6 within
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year-end 2012 was $2.2 billion, representing a settlement receivable of $64 million. The total notional amount of interest rate swaps at
year-end 2011 was $600 million, representing a settlement receivable of $23 million. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by
approximately $24 million at year-end 2012 and $18 million at year-end 2011.

Price risk

Our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials, fuel, and energy. Primary exposures
include corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar, cocoa, cartonboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We have historically used the combination of long-term contracts with suppliers, and exchange-traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations
in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months. During 2006, we entered into two separate 10-year over-the-counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of
natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes. The notional amount of the swaps totaled $84 million as of December 29, 2012 and equates to approximately 50% of our North America manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge
period. At year-end December 31, 2011 the notional amount was $104 million.

The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at
year-end 2012, including the North America natural gas swaps, was $136 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $36 million. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year-end 2011, including
the natural gas swaps, was $175 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $48 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year-end commodity prices, the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately
$9 million at year-end 2012, and $12 million at year-end 2011, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.

In addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above, we use long-term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials,
including rice, sugar, cartonboard, and corrugated boxes. It should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company.

Reciprocal collateralization agreements

In
some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or
letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount. As of December 29, 2012, we had received $8 million cash collateral from a counterparty, which was reflected as a decrease in other assets
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2011, we had posted collateral of $2 million in the form of cash, which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 1

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Kellogg Company, those of the subsidiaries that it controls due to ownership of a majority voting interest and the accounts of the variable interest entities (VIEs) of which Kellogg Company is the
primary beneficiary (Kellogg or the Company). The Company continually evaluates its involvement with VIEs to determine whether it has variable interests and is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. When these criteria are met, the Company is required
to consolidate the VIE. The Company’s share of earnings or losses of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in its consolidated operating results using the equity method of accounting when it is able to exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial decisions of the affiliate. The Company uses the cost method of accounting if it is not able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the affiliate. Intercompany balances and
transactions are eliminated.

The Company’s fiscal year normally ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and as a
result, a 53rd week is added approximately every sixth year. The Company’s 2012, 2011 and 2010 fiscal years each contained 52 weeks and ended on December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011, respectively.
The next fiscal year which will contain a 53

rd

week for the Company will be
2014, ending on January 3, 2015.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents

Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.

Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable
consists principally of trade receivables, which are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and prompt payment discounts. Trade receivables do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents
management’s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable, as determined from a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when
management determines the receivable is uncollectible. The Company does not have off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on an
average cost basis.

Property

The Company’s property consists mainly of plants and equipment used for manufacturing activities. These assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over
estimated useful lives using straight-line methods for financial reporting and accelerated methods, where permitted, for tax reporting. Major property categories are depreciated over various periods as follows (in years): manufacturing machinery and
equipment 5-20; office equipment 4-5; computer equipment and capitalized software 3-7; building components 15-25; building structures 50. Cost includes interest associated with significant capital projects. Plant and equipment are reviewed for
impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions include an extended period of idleness or a plan of disposal. Assets to be disposed of at a future date are depreciated over the remaining period of
use. Assets to be sold are written down to realizable value at the time the assets are being actively marketed for sale and a sale is expected to occur within one year. As of year-end 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of assets held for sale was
insignificant.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be
impaired. An intangible asset with a finite life is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.

For the goodwill impairment
test, the fair value of the reporting units are estimated based on market multiples. This approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, earnings for companies that are comparable to the
Company’s reporting units and discounted cash flow. The assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for the Company’s reporting units.


Similarly, impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of
that particular asset. Fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected
royalty stream attributable to branded product sales, discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants.

These estimates are made
using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes
sales upon delivery of its products to customers. Revenue, which includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer, is reported net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, and various government withholding taxes.
Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where
applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance.

Advertising and promotion

The Company expenses production costs of advertising the first time
the advertising takes place. Advertising expense is classified in selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense.

The Company classifies promotional
payments to its customers, the cost of consumer coupons, and other cash redemption offers in net sales. The cost of promotional package inserts is recorded in cost of goods sold (COGS). Other types of consumer promotional expenditures are recorded
in SGA expense.

Research and development

The costs of research and development (R&D) are expensed as incurred and are classified in SGA expense. R&D includes expenditures for new product and process innovation, as well as significant technological
improvements to existing products and processes. The Company’s R&D expenditures primarily consist of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to time spent on R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and
maintenance of research facilities and equipment, including assets at manufacturing locations that are temporarily engaged in pilot plant activities.

Stock-based compensation

The Company uses stock-based compensation, including stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, and executive performance shares, to provide long-term performance incentives for its global workforce.

The
Company classifies pre-tax stock compensation expense principally in SGA expense within its corporate operations. Expense attributable to awards of equity instruments is recorded in capital in excess of par value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Certain of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, disability, or death
of eligible employees and directors. A stock-based award is considered vested for expense attribution purposes when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the Company
recognizes compensation cost immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.

The Company recognizes compensation cost for stock option awards that have a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for
the entire award.

Corporate income tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings
(“windfall tax benefit”) is recorded in other financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to capital in excess of par value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized
shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense. The Company currently has
sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb arising shortfalls, such that earnings were not affected during the periods presented. Correspondingly, the Company includes the impact of pro forma deferred tax assets (i.e., the “as
if” windfall or shortfall) for purposes of determining assumed proceeds in the treasury stock calculation of diluted earnings per share.

Income taxes

The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions based on a benefit recognition
model. Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement. The tax
position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. The Company


classifies income tax-related interest and penalties as interest expense and SGA expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The current portion of the Company’s
unrecognized tax benefits is presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current assets and other current liabilities, and the amounts expected to be settled after one year are recorded in other assets and other liabilities.

Income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the United States.

Derivative Instruments

The fair value of
derivative instruments is recorded in other current assets, other assets, other current liabilities or other liabilities. Gains and losses representing either hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or
hedges of translational exposure are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in other income (expense), net (OIE). In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, settlements of cash flow and fair value hedges are classified as an operating
activity; settlements of all other derivative instruments, including instruments for which hedge accounting has been discontinued, are classified consistent with the nature of the instrument.

Cash flow hedges.

Qualifying derivatives
are accounted for as cash flow hedges when the hedged item is a forecasted transaction. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item
is realized, gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) to the Consolidated Statement of Income on the same line item as the underlying transaction.

Fair value
hedges.

Qualifying derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. Gains and losses on these
instruments are recorded in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item.

Net
investment hedges.

Qualifying derivative and nonderivative financial instruments are accounted for as net investment hedges
when the hedged item is a nonfunctional currency investment in a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in AOCI.

Derivatives not designated for hedge
accounting.

Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, on same line item as the
underlying hedged item.

Other contracts.

The Company periodically enters into foreign currency forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in the translation of foreign
currency earnings to U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in OIE, generally reducing the exposure to translation volatility during a full-year period.

Foreign currency exchange
risk.

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third-party purchases,
intercompany transactions and when applicable, nonfunctional currency denominated third-party debt. The Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of
these investments. Additionally, the Company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to U.S. dollars. Management assesses foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational
volatility and may enter into forward contracts, options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements are
established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issues.

For foreign currency cash flow and fair value hedges, the assessment of
effectiveness is generally based on changes in spot rates. Changes in time value are reported in OIE.

Interest rate risk.

The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility
with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt. The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps, including forward-starting swaps, to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs
associated with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions.

Fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and the assessment of effectiveness is based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt, using incremental borrowing rates
currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities.

Price risk.

The Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials, fuel, and
energy. The Company has historically used the combination of long-term contracts with suppliers, and exchange-traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a
duration of generally less than 18 months.


Certain commodity contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, while others are marked to market through
earnings. The assessment of effectiveness for exchange-traded instruments is based on changes in futures prices. The assessment of effectiveness for over-the-counter transactions is based on changes in designated indices.

Pension benefits, nonpension postretirement and postemployment benefits

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees, as well as salary continuance, severance, and long-term disability to
former or inactive employees.

The recognition of benefit expense is based on actuarial assumptions, such as discount rate, long-term rate of
compensation increase, long-term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate, and is reported in COGS and SGA expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Postemployment benefits.

The Company
recognizes an obligation for postemployment benefit plans that vest or accumulate with service. Obligations associated with the Company’s postemployment benefit plans, which are unfunded, are included in other current liabilities and other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. All gains and losses are recognized over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.

Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service or benefits to employees in excess of those specified in the respective plans are expensed as incurred.

Pension and nonpension postretirement
benefits.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company elected to change its policy for recognizing expense for pension and nonpension
postretirement benefits. Previously, the Company recognized actuarial gains and losses associated with benefit obligations in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet upon each plan remeasurement, amortizing them into
operating results over the average future service period of active employees in these plans. Under the new policy, the Company has elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which they

occur, eliminating the amortization. Experience gains and losses will be recognized annually as of the measurement date, which is the Company’s fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted
accounting principles. The Company believes the new policy provides greater transparency to on-going operating results and better reflects the Company’s obligations to its employees and the impact of the current market conditions on those
obligations.

Additionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets, the Company will no longer use the market-related value of
plan assets; an averaging technique permitted under generally accepted accounting principles, but instead will use the fair value of plan assets.

Concurrent with this change in policy, the Company has elected to modify its allocation of pension and postretirement benefit plan costs to reportable segments for
management evaluation and reporting purposes. Previously the Company included the total costs for these benefits within the reportable segment results. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, the reportable segments are allocated service cost and
amortization of prior service cost. All other components of pension and postretirement benefit expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets, and experience gains and losses are considered unallocated corporate costs and are not
included in the measure of reportable segment operating results. Financial results for 2011 and prior have been re-cast to include the impact of adopting new pension and post-retirement benefit plan accounting. See Note 16 for more information on
reportable segments.

Management reviews the Company’s expected long-term rates of return annually; however, the benefit trust investment
performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence this evaluation. The expected rates of return are generally not revised provided these rates fall between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term
returns, as determined by the Company’s modeling process.

For defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, the Company records the net
overfunded or underfunded position as a pension asset or pension liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.


The changes in policy during 2012 have been reported through retrospective application of the new policies to all
periods presented. The Company also considered the impact of recast pension and postretirement benefit expense on capitalized inventory balances in prior periods. The impacts of this change in policy to the financial statements are summarized below:


New accounting standards

Presentation of Comprehensive
Income

.  In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard requiring most entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive
income either in one continuous statement — referred to as the statement of comprehensive income — or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and comprehensive income. The update does not change the items that must be
reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The Company adopted this new standard in 2012.

Goodwill impairment testing

.  In September 2011, the FASB issued an updated
accounting standard to allow entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the updated standard an entity would not be required to
calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company adopted the revised guidance in 2012,
with no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Multiemployer pension and
postretirement benefit plans

.  In September 2011, the FASB issued an updated accounting standard to provide more information about an employer’s financial obligations to
multiemployer pension and postretirement benefit plans. Previously, employers were only required to disclose their total contributions to all multiemployer plans in which they participate and certain year-to-year changes in circumstances. The
enhanced disclosures required under the revised guidance provide additional information regarding the overall financial health of the plan and the level of the employer’s participation in the plan. The Company adopted the revised guidance in
2012. Refer to Note 10 for disclosures regarding multiemployer plans in which the Company participates.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Pringles

®

acquisition

On May 31, 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of the

Pringles

®

business (Pringles) from The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) for $2.695 billion, or $2.683 billion net of cash and cash equivalents, subject to
certain purchase price adjustments. Through December 29, 2012, the net purchase price adjustments have resulted in a reduction of the purchase price by approximately $15 million. The purchase price, net of cash and cash equivalents, totals
$2.668 billion. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method and was financed through a combination of cash on hand, and short-term and long-term debt. The assets and liabilities of Pringles are included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 29, 2012 and the results of the Pringles operations subsequent to the acquisition date are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The acquired assets and assumed liabilities include the following:

Goodwill of $645 million is expected to be deductible for statutory tax purposes.

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets recognized.


The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition primarily reflects the value of providing an established platform to leverage the Company’s existing brands in the international snacks
category, synergies expected to arise from the combined brand portfolios, as well as any intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.

The above amounts, including the allocation to reportable segments, represent the preliminary allocation of purchase price, and are subject to revision when the
purchase price adjustments and the resulting valuations of property and intangible assets are finalized, which will occur prior to May 31, 2013.

Through December 29, 2012, the Company incurred transaction fees and other integration-related costs as part of the Pringles acquisition as follows: $73
million recorded in SGA, $3 million recorded in COGS and $5 million in fees for a bridge financing facility which are recorded in OIE.

Pringles
contributed net revenues of $887 million and net earnings of $31 million since the acquisition, including the transaction fees and other integration-related costs discussed above. The unaudited pro forma combined historical results, as if Pringles
had been acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2011 are estimated to be:

The pro forma results include
transaction and bridge financing costs, interest expense on the debt issued to finance the acquisition, amortization of the definite lived intangible assets, and depreciation based on estimated fair value and useful lives. The pro forma results are
not necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred if the acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of 2011, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results.

In December 2012, the Company also entered into a series of agreements with a third party including a loan of $44 million which is convertible into approximately
85% of the equity of the entity. Due to this convertible loan and other agreements, the Company determined that the entity is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company has consolidated the financial statements of the
VIE in 2012 and treated the consolidation as a business acquisition, which resulted in the following: current assets, $14 million; property, $36 million; amortizable intangibles and other non-current assets, $26 million; goodwill, $76 million;
current liabilities, $2 million; notes payable and long-term debt, $39 million; non-current deferred tax liabilities, $8 million; and noncontrolling interests, $59 million. This business is included in the U.S. Snacks reportable segment and the
above amounts represent the preliminary allocation and are subject to revision when the resulting valuations of property and intangible assets are finalized in 2013.

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, including the preliminary allocation of goodwill resulting from the Pringles acquisition to the Company’s reportable segments for the year ended December 29,
2012 are presented in the following table.


(a)

The currently estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five succeeding fiscal periods is approximately $7 million per year.

Impairment charges

In 2012, the Company determined that certain long-lived assets in Australia were impaired and should be written down to their estimated fair value of $11 million.
This resulted in a fixed asset impairment charge of $17 million that was recorded in COGS in the Asia Pacific operating segment.

In 2008, the Company
acquired a majority interest in the business of Zhenghang Food Company Ltd. (Navigable Foods), a manufacturer of cookies and crackers in the northern and northeastern regions of China. During 2011, the Company acquired the noncontrolling interest
for no consideration. A portion of the original purchase price aggregating $5 million was paid in 2012.

In 2010, the Company recorded impairment
charges totaling $29 million in connection with Navigable Foods, which included $20 million of goodwill. The China business generated operating losses since the acquisition and that trend was expected to continue. As a result, management
determined in 2010 the current business was not the right vehicle for entry into the Chinese marketplace and began exploring various strategic alternatives to reduce operating losses in the future. The impairment charge was recorded
in SGA expense in the Asia Pacific operating segment.


Prior to assessing the goodwill for impairment, the Company determined that the long-lived assets of the China
reporting unit were impaired and should be written down to their estimated fair value of $10 million. This resulted in a fixed asset impairment charge of $9 million in 2010 that was recorded in the Asia Pacific operating segment, of which $8
million was recorded in COGS, and $1 million was recorded in SGA expense.

During 2012, the Company sold the net assets of Navigable Foods for proceeds
of $11 million which approximated carrying value.

NOTE 3

EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

The Company views its continued spending on cost-reduction
initiatives as part of its ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving its long-term profit growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five-year period of
completion. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.

Summary of activities

During 2012, the Company recorded $18 million of costs associated with
exit or disposal activities. $3 million represented severance, and $19 million for asset write-offs offset by a reduction of $4 million in a pension withdrawal liability. $18 million of asset write-offs were recorded in COGS in the
following reportable segments (in millions): Europe-$1; and Asia Pacific $17. SGA expense, included a $4 million credit to pension in U.S. Snacks, $2 million of severance in U.S. Snacks, $1 million of severance in U.S. Morning Foods and Kashi and $1
million of asset write-offs in U.S. Snacks. At December 29, 2012, exit cost reserves were $1 million, related to severance payments which will be made in 2013.

The Company recorded $24 million of costs in 2011 associated with exit or disposal activities. $7 million represented severance, $12 million was for pension costs, $2 million for other cash costs including
relocation of assets and employees and $3 million for asset write-offs. $10 million of the charges were recorded in COGS in the European reportable segment. $14 million of the charges were recorded in SGA expense in the following reportable segments
(in millions): U.S. Snacks-$13; and Europe-$1. Exit cost reserves at December 31, 2011 were $1 million related to severance payments.

During
2010, the Company recorded $19 million of costs associated with exit or disposal activities. $6 million represented severance, $7 million for other cash costs including relocation of assets and employees, $5 million was for pension costs
and $1 million for asset write offs. $4 million of the charges were recorded in COGS in the European reportable segment. $15 million of the charges were recorded in SGA expense in the following reportable segments (in millions): U.S. Morning
Foods and Kashi—$2; U.S. Snacks—$8; North America Other—$1; Europe—$2; and Asia Pacific—$2. Exit cost reserves at January 1, 2011 were $5 million related to severance payments.

Cost Summary

In 2009, the Company commenced
various COGS and SGA programs. The COGS program seeks to optimize the Company’s global manufacturing network, reduce waste, and develop best practices on a global basis. The SGA programs focus on improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness
of various global support functions.

For COGS and SGA programs that are still active through 2012, total program costs incurred to date were $46
million and include $8 million for severance, $3 million for other cash costs including relocation of assets and employees, $13 million for pension costs and $22 million for asset write-offs. The costs impacted reportable segments as follows (in
millions): U.S. Morning Foods and Kashi-$1; U.S Snacks-$18; Europe-$10; and Asia Pacific-$17.

NOTE 4

EQUITY

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing net income attributable to Kellogg Company by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is similarly determined, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares
had been issued. Dilutive potential common shares consist principally of employee stock options issued by the Company, and to a lesser extent, certain contingently issuable performance shares. Basic earnings per share is reconciled to diluted
earnings per share in the following table:


The total number of anti-dilutive potential common shares excluded from the reconciliation for each period was (in
millions): 2012-9.9; 2011-4.2; 2010-4.9.

Stock transactions

The Company issues shares to employees and directors under various equity-based compensation and stock purchase programs, as further discussed
in Note 7. The number of shares issued during the periods presented was (in millions): 2012–5; 2011–7; 2010–5. The Company issued shares totaling less than one million in each of the years presented under

Kellogg Direct

TM

, a direct stock purchase and
dividend reinvestment plan for U.S. shareholders.

On April 23, 2010, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $2.5 billion
three-year share repurchase program for 2010 through 2012. During 2012, the Company repurchased 1 million shares of common stock for a total of $63 million. During 2011, the Company repurchased 15 million shares of common stock for a total
of $793 million. During 2010, the Company repurchased 21 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $1,057 million, of which $1,052 was paid during the year and $5 million was payable at 2010.

Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income
includes net income and all other changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by or distributions to shareholders. Other comprehensive income for all years presented consists of foreign currency translation adjustments,
fair value adjustments associated with cash flow hedges and adjustments for net experience losses and prior service cost related to employee benefit plans. In 2011, other comprehensive income also includes fair value adjustments associated with net
investment hedges of foreign subsidiaries.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011
consisted of the following:

NOTE 5

LEASES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

The Company’s leases are generally for equipment and
warehouse space. Rent expense on all operating leases was (in millions): 2012-$174; 2011-$166; 2010-$154. During 2012, the Company entered into approximately $4 million in capital lease agreements to finance the purchase of equipment. The Company
did not enter into any material capital lease agreements during 2010 or 2011.

At December 29, 2012, future minimum annual lease commitments under
non-cancelable operating and capital leases were as follows:

The Company has provided various standard indemnifications in agreements to sell and purchase business assets and lease facilities
over the past several years, related primarily to pre-existing tax, environmental, and employee benefit obligations. Certain of these indemnifications are limited by agreement in either amount and/or term and others are unlimited. The Company has
also provided various “hold harmless” provisions within certain service type agreements. Because the Company is not currently aware of any actual exposures associated with these indemnifications, management is unable to estimate the
maximum potential future payments to be made. At December 29, 2012, the Company had not recorded any liability related to these indemnifications.


NOTE 6

DEBT

The following table presents the components of notes payable at year end
December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011:

The following table presents the components of long-term debt at year end December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011:

(a)

In March 2001, the Company issued long-term debt instruments, primarily to finance the acquisition of Keebler Foods Company, of which $1.1 billion of thirty-year 7.45% Debentures
remain outstanding. The effective interest rate on the Debentures, reflecting issuance discount and hedge settlement, was 7.62%. The Debentures contain standard events of default and covenants, and can be redeemed in whole or in part by the Company
at any time at prices determined under a formula (but not less than 100% of the principal amount plus unpaid interest to the redemption date).

(b)

In December 2010, the Company issued $1.0 billion of ten-year 4.0% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes for incremental pension and
postretirement benefit plan contributions and to retire a portion of its commercial paper. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount and hedge settlement, was 3.42%. The Notes contain customary covenants that limit the
ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision.

(c)

In May 2009, the Company issued $750 million of seven-year 4.45% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes to retire a portion of its
commercial paper. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount, hedge settlement and interest rate swaps was 3.29% at December 29, 2012. The Notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and
its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision. The Company entered into interest rate swaps in February 2011
and March 2012 with notional amounts totaling $200 million and $500 million, respectively, which effectively converted these Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the seven-year term. These derivative instruments
were designated as fair value hedges of the debt obligation. The fair value adjustment for the interest rate swaps was $23 million and $14 million, and was recorded as an increase in the hedged debt balance at December 29, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively.

(d)

In March 2008, the Company issued $750 million of five-year 4.25% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes to retire a portion of its U.S.
commercial paper. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount, hedge settlement and interest rate swaps was 1.73% at December 29, 2012. The Notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and
its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision. In conjunction with this debt issuance, the Company entered
into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $750 million, which effectively converted this debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation. These derivative instruments were designated as fair value hedges of the debt
obligation. During 2011, the Company transferred a portion of the interest rate swaps to another counterparty and subsequently terminated all the interest rate swaps. The resulting unamortized gain of $4 million and $22 million, at December 29,
2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the Notes.

(e)

In May 2012, the Company issued $700 million of ten-year 3.125% U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes for general corporate purposes, including financing a
portion of the acquisition of Pringles. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount, was 3.21%. The Notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to
incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision.

(f)

In November 2009, the Company issued $500 million of ten-year 4.15% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes to retire a
portion of its 6.6% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2011. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount, hedge settlement and interest rate swaps was 2.77% at December 29, 2012. The Notes contain customary covenants that
limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision. In March 2012, the
Company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively converted these Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the ten-year term. These derivative instruments were designated as fair


value hedges of the debt obligation. The fair value adjustment for the interest rate swaps was $15 million, and was recorded as an increase in the hedged debt balance at December 29,
2012.

(g)

In November 2011, the Company issued $500 million of five-year 1.875% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes for general corporate purposes
including repayment of a portion of its commercial paper. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount, hedge settlement and interest rate swaps was 1.18% at December 29, 2012. The Notes contain customary covenants
that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision. In March 2012, the
Company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively converted these Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the five-year term. These derivative instruments were designated as fair value hedges of the debt
obligation. The fair value adjustment for the interest rate swaps was $9 million, and was recorded as an increase in the hedged debt balance at December 29, 2012.

(h)

In May 2011, the Company issued $400 million of seven-year 3.25% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes for general corporate purposes
including repayment of a portion of its commercial paper. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount, hedge settlement and interest rate swaps, was 2.14% at December 29, 2012. The Notes contain customary covenants
that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision. In October 2011,
the Company entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $400 million, which effectively converted these Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the seven-year term. These derivative instruments
were designated as fair value hedges of the debt obligation. The fair value adjustment for the interest rate swaps was $21 million and $10 million, and was recorded as an increase in the hedged debt balance at December 29, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively.

(i)

In May 2012, the Company issued $400 million of five-year 1.75% U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes for general corporate purposes, including financing a
portion of the acquisition of Pringles. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount, was 1.86%. The Notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to
incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision.

(j)

In May 2012, the Company issued $350 million of three-year 1.125% U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes for general corporate purposes, including financing
a portion of the acquisition of Pringles. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount, was 1.16%. The Notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined)
to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision.

(k)

In May 2012, the Company issued Cdn.$300 million of two-year 2.10% fixed rate Canadian Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes for general corporate purposes, which
included repayment of intercompany debt. This repayment resulted in cash available to be used for a portion of the acquisition of Pringles. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount, was 2.11%. The Notes contain
customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of control provision.

(l)

In December 2007, the Company issued $750 million of five-year 5.125% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using net proceeds from these Notes to replace a portion of its U.S.
commercial paper. The Notes contained customary covenants that limited the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. The customary covenants
also contained a change of control provision. In May 2009, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $750 million, which effectively converted these Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation. These
derivative instruments were designated as fair value hedges of the debt obligation. The Company terminated the interest rate swaps in August 2011, and redeemed the Notes in December 2012.

In March 2012, the Company entered into an unsecured 364-Day Term Loan Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) to fund, in part, the acquisition of
Pringles from P&G. The New Credit Agreement allowed the Company to borrow up to $1 billion to fund, in part, the acquisition and pay related fees and expenses. The loans under the New Credit Agreement were to mature and be payable in full
364 days after the date on which the loans were made. The New Credit Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and covenants, including restrictions on indebtedness, liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and a specified interest
expense coverage ratio. If an event of default occurred, then, to the extent permitted under the New Credit Agreement, the administrative agent could (i) not earlier than the date on which the acquisition is or is to be consummated, terminate
the commitments under the New Credit Agreement and (ii) accelerate any outstanding loans under the New Credit Agreement. The Company had no borrowings against the New Credit Agreement and, in May 2012, upon issuance of the U.S. Dollar
Notes described above, the available commitments under the New Credit Agreement were automatically and permanently reduced to $0.

In February 2007, the
Company and two of its subsidiaries (the Issuers) established a program under which the Issuers may issue euro-commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $750 million or its equivalent in alternative
currencies. The notes may have maturities ranging up to 364 days and will be senior unsecured obligations of the applicable Issuer. Notes issued by subsidiary Issuers will be guaranteed


by the Company. The notes may be issued at a discount or may bear fixed or floating rate interest or a coupon calculated by reference to an index or formula. As of December 29, 2012 there
was $159 million outstanding under this program. There were no notes outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2011.

At December 29,
2012, the Company had $2.2 billion of short-term lines of credit, virtually all of which were unused and available for borrowing on an unsecured basis. These lines were comprised principally of an unsecured Four-Year Credit Agreement, which the
Company entered into in March 2011 and expires in 2015. The Four-Year Credit Agreement allows the Company to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion, to obtain letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to $75 million,
U.S. swingline loans in an aggregate amount up to $200 million and European swingline loans in an aggregate amount up to $400 million and to provide a procedure for lenders to bid on short-term debt of the Company. The agreement contains
customary covenants and warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and a specified interest coverage ratio. If an event of default occurs, then, to the extent permitted, the administrative
agent may terminate the commitments under the credit facility, accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreement, and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lender’s letter of credit exposure plus interest.

The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 29, 2012.

Scheduled principal repayments on long-term debt are (in millions): 2013–$759; 2014–$316; 2015–$355; 2016–$1,255; 2017–$404; 2018 and beyond–$3,703.

Interest paid was (in millions): 2012–$254; 2011–$249; 2010–$244. Interest expense capitalized as part of the construction cost of fixed assets was
(in millions): 2012–$2; 2011–$5; 2010–$2.

NOTE 7

STOCK COMPENSATION

The Company uses various equity-based compensation programs to provide
long-term performance incentives for its global workforce. Currently, these incentives consist principally of stock options, and to a lesser extent, executive performance shares, restricted stock units and restricted stock grants. The Company also
sponsors a discounted stock purchase plan in the United States and matching-grant programs in several international locations. Additionally, the Company awards restricted stock to its outside directors. These awards are administered through several
plans, as described within this Note.

The 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2009 Plan), approved by shareholders in 2009, permits awards to employees and
officers in the form of incentive and non-qualified stock options, performance units, restricted stock or restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. The 2009 Plan, which replaced the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2003 Plan), authorizes
the issuance of a total of (a) 27 million shares; plus (b) the total number of shares as to which awards granted under the 2009 Plan or the 2003 or 2001 Incentive Plans expire or are forfeited, terminated or settled in cash. No more
than 5 million shares can be issued in satisfaction of performance units, performance-based restricted shares and other awards (excluding stock options and stock appreciation rights). There are additional annual limitations on awards or
payments to individual participants. Options granted under the 2009 Plan generally vest over three years. At December 29, 2012, there were 10 million remaining authorized, but unissued, shares under the 2009 Plan.

The Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (2009 Director Plan) was approved by shareholders in 2009 and allows each eligible non-employee director to receive shares of
the Company’s common stock annually. The number of shares granted pursuant to each annual award will be determined by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. The 2009 Director Plan, which replaced the 2000
Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (2000 Director Plan), reserves 500,000 shares for issuance, plus the total number of shares as to which awards granted under the 2009 Director Plan or the 2000 Director Plans expire or are forfeited, terminated or
settled in cash. Under both the 2009 and 2000 Director Plans, shares (other than stock options) are placed in the Kellogg Company Grantor Trust for Non-Employee Directors (the Grantor Trust). Under the terms of the Grantor Trust, shares are
available to a director only upon termination of service on the Board. Under the 2009 Director Plan, awards were as follows (number of shares): 2012-26,490; 2011-24,850; 2010-26,000.

The 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was approved by shareholders in 2002 and permits eligible employees to purchase Company stock at a discounted price. This plan allows for a maximum of 2.5 million shares
of Company stock to be issued at a purchase price equal to 95% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of the quarterly purchase period. Total purchases through this plan for any employee are limited to a fair market value of $25,000
during any calendar year. At December 29, 2012, there were approximately 0.6 million remaining authorized, but unissued, shares under this plan. Shares were purchased by employees under this plan as follows (approximate number of shares):
2012–107,000; 2011–110,000; 2010–123,000. Options granted to employees to purchase discounted stock under this plan are included in the option activity tables within this note.


Additionally, during 2002, an international subsidiary of the Company established a stock purchase plan for its
employees. Subject to limitations, employee contributions to this plan are matched 1:1 by the Company. Under this plan, shares were granted by the Company to match an equal number of shares purchased by employees as follows (approximate number of
shares): 2012–71,000; 2011–68,000; 2010–66,000.

Compensation expense for all types of equity-based programs and the related income tax
benefit recognized were as follows:

As of December 29, 2012, total stock-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $44 million
and the weighted-average period over which this amount is expected to be recognized was 2 years.

Cash flows realized upon exercise or vesting of
stock-based awards in the periods presented are included in the following table. Tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting of stock-based awards generally represent the tax benefit of the difference between the exercise price and the strike
price of the option.

Cash used by the Company to settle equity instruments granted under stock-based awards was insignificant.

Shares used to satisfy stock-based awards are normally issued out of treasury stock, although management is authorized to issue new
shares to the extent permitted by respective plan provisions. Refer to Note 4 for information on shares issued during the periods presented to employees and directors under various long-term incentive plans and share repurchases under the
Company’s stock repurchase authorizations. The Company does not currently have a policy of repurchasing a specified number of shares issued under employee benefit programs during any particular time period.

Stock options

During the periods presented,
non-qualified stock options were granted to eligible employees under the 2009 Plan with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the grant date, a contractual term of ten years, and a three-year graded vesting
period.

Management estimates the fair value of each annual stock option award on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model.
Composite assumptions are presented in the following table. Weighted-average values are disclosed for certain inputs which incorporate a range of assumptions. Expected volatilities are based principally on historical volatility of the Company’s
stock, and to a lesser extent, on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s stock. Historical volatility corresponds to the contractual term of the options granted. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise
and employee termination within the valuation models; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time
that options granted are expected to be outstanding; the weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the following table. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.


A summary of option activity for the year ended December 29, 2012 is presented in the following table:

Additionally, option activity for the comparable prior year periods is presented in the following table:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the periods presented was (in millions): 2012–$34; 2011–$63;
2010–$45.

Other stock-based awards

During the periods presented, other stock-based awards consisted principally of executive performance shares and restricted stock granted under the 2009 Plan.

In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company made performance share awards to a limited number of senior executive-level employees, which entitles these employees to
receive a specified number of shares of the Company’s common stock on the vesting date, provided cumulative three-year targets are achieved. The cumulative three-year targets involved operating profit and internal net sales growth. Management
estimates the fair value of performance share awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the performance period. The 2012, 2011 and 2010 target
grants (as revised for non-vested forfeitures and other adjustments) currently correspond to approximately 225,000, 199,000 and 193,000 shares, respectively, with a grant-date fair value of $47, $48, and $48 per share. The actual number of
shares issued on the vesting date could range from zero to 200% of target, depending on actual performance achieved. Based on the market price of the Company’s common stock at year-end 2012, the maximum future value that could be awarded on the
vesting date was (in millions): 2012 award–$25; 2011 award–$22; and 2010 award–$5. The 2009 performance share award, payable in stock, was settled at 82% of target in February 2012 for a total dollar equivalent of $7 million.

The Company also periodically grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to eligible employees under the 2009 Plan. Restrictions with respect
to sale or transferability generally lapse after three years and, in the case of restricted stock, the grantee is normally entitled to receive shareholder dividends during the vesting period. Management estimates the fair value of restricted stock
grants based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. A summary of restricted stock activity for the year ended December 29, 2012, is presented in the following table:

Grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units for comparable prior-year periods were: 2011–102,000; 2010–121,000.

The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vesting in the periods presented was (in millions): 2012–$4; 2011–$7;
2010–$3.

NOTE 8

PENSION BENEFITS

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign pension plans to
provide retirement benefits for its employees. The majority of these plans are funded or unfunded defined benefit plans, although the Company does participate in a limited number of multiemployer or other defined contribution plans for certain
employee groups. See Note 10 for more information regarding the Company’s participation in multiemployer plans. Defined benefits for salaried employees are generally based on salary and years of service, while union employee benefits are
generally a negotiated amount for each year of service.


As discussed in Note 1, in the fourth quarter of 2012 the Company changed its policy for recognizing expense for its
pension and post-retirement benefit plans. All amounts have been adjusted to reflect the new policy.

Obligations and funded status

The aggregate change in projected benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status is presented in the following tables.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $4.7 billion and $4.0 billion at
December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Information for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were:

Expense

The
components of pension expense are presented in the following table. Pension expense for defined contribution plans relates to certain foreign-based defined contribution plans and multiemployer plans in the United States in which the Company
participates on behalf of certain unionized workforces.

The estimated prior service cost for defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive
income into pension expense over the next fiscal year is approximately $16 million.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor 401(k) or
similar savings plans for active employees. Expense related to these plans was (in millions): 2012 – $39; 2011 – $36; 2010 – $37. These amounts are not included in the preceding expense table. Company contributions
to these savings plans approximate annual expense. Company contributions to multiemployer and other defined contribution pension plans approximate the amount of annual expense presented in the preceding table.

Assumptions

The worldwide weighted-average
actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were:




Discount rate

4.0%

4.8%

5.4%

Long-term rate of compensation increase

4.1%

4.2%

The worldwide weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine annual net periodic benefit cost were:




Discount rate

Long-term rate of compensation increase

4.2%

4.2%

4.1%

Long-term rate of return on plan assets

8.9%

8.9%

8.9%

To determine the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company models expected returns over a 20-year
investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of its major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including
consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. The U.S. model,


which corresponds to approximately 69% of consolidated pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium
of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. The expected rate of return for 2012 of 8.9% equated to approximately the
62nd percentile expectation. Refer to Note 1.

To conduct the annual review of discount rates, the Company selected the discount rate based on a
cash-flow matching analysis using Towers Watson’s proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that
produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve
created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. The
measurement dates for the defined benefit plans are consistent with the Company’s fiscal year end. Accordingly, the Company selected discount rates to measure the benefit obligations consistent with market indices during December of each year.

Plan assets

The Company
categorized Plan assets within a three level fair value hierarchy described as follows:

Investments stated at fair value as determined by quoted market
prices (Level 1) include:

Cash and cash equivalents:

Value based on cost, which approximates fair value.

Corporate stock, common:

Value based on the last sales price on the primary exchange.

Investments stated at estimated fair value using significant observable inputs (Level 2) include:

Cash and cash equivalents:

Institutional short-term investment vehicles valued
daily.

Mutual
funds:

Valued at the net asset value of shares held by the Plan at year end.

Collective trusts

:

Value based on the net asset value of units held at year end.

Bonds:

Value based on matrices or
models from pricing vendors.

Limited partnerships:

Value based on the ending net capital account balance at year end.

Investments stated at estimated fair value using
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) include:

Real Estate:

Value based on the net asset value of units held at year end. The fair value of real estate holdings is based on market data including earnings capitalization, discounted cash flow analysis, comparable
sales transactions or a combination of these methods.

Bonds:

Value based on matrices or models from brokerage firms. A limited number of the investments are in default.

The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation
methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting
date.

The Company’s practice regarding the timing of transfers between levels is to measure transfers in at the beginning of the month and
transfers out at the end of the month. For the year ended December 29, 2012, the Company had no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.

The fair
value of Plan assets as of December 29, 2012 summarized by level within the fair value hierarchy are as follows:


The fair value of Plan assets at December 31, 2011 are summarized as follows:

There were no unfunded commitments to purchase investments at December 29, 2012 or December 31, 2011.

The Company’s investment strategy for its major defined benefit plans is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of meeting
long-term cash requirements as they become due. Assets are invested in a prudent manner to maintain the security of funds while maximizing returns within the Plan’s investment policy. The investment policy specifies the type of investment
vehicles appropriate for the Plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for the selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager performance. It also provides guidelines enabling
Plan fiduciaries to fulfill their responsibilities.

The current weighted-average target asset allocation reflected by this strategy is: equity
securities–74%; debt securities–23%; other–3%. Investment in Company common stock represented 1.3% of consolidated plan assets at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax
regulations and funding requirements. The Company currently expects to contribute approximately $46 million to its defined benefit pension plans during 2013.

Level 3 gains and losses

Changes in the fair value of the Plan’s Level 3 assets are
summarized as follows:

The net change in Level 3 assets includes a gain attributable to the change in unrealized holding gains or losses related to Level
3 assets held at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 totaling $8 million and $4 million, respectively.

Benefit
payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid (in millions):
2013–$230; 2014–$228; 2015–$236; 2016–$260; 2017–$252; 2018 to 2022–$1,455.

NOTE 9

NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Postretirement

The Company sponsors a number of plans to provide health care and other welfare
benefits to retired employees in the United States and Canada, who have met certain age and service requirements. The majority of these plans are funded or unfunded defined benefit plans, although the Company does participate in a limited number of
multiemployer or other defined contribution plans for certain employee groups. The Company contributes to voluntary employee benefit association (VEBA) trusts to fund certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit obligations.

As discussed in Note 1, in the fourth quarter of 2012 the Company changed its policy for recognizing expense for its pension and post-retirement benefit plans. All
amounts have been adjusted to reflect the new policy.

In the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed
into law. There are various provisions which impacted the Company; however, the Act did not have a material impact on the accumulated benefit obligation as of January 1, 2011 for nonpension postretirement benefit plans.


Obligations and funded status

The aggregate change in accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status is presented in the following tables.

Expense

Components of postretirement benefit expense were:

The estimated prior service cost credit that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into nonpension
postretirement benefit expense over the next fiscal year is expected to be approximately $3 million.

Assumptions

The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were:




Discount rate

5.3 %

5.7 %

Long-term rate of return on plan assets

8.9 %

The Company determines the overall discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on VEBA trust obligations and assets in the
same manner as that described for pension trusts in Note 8.

The assumed health care cost trend rate is 5.5% for 2013, decreasing gradually to 4.5%
by the year 2015 and remaining at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect the Company’s historical experience and management’s expectations regarding future trends. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend
rates would have the following effects:

Plan assets

The fair value of Plan assets as of December 29, 2012 summarized by level within fair value hierarchy described in Note 8, are as follows:


The fair value of Plan assets at December 31, 2011 are summarized as follows:

The Company’s asset investment strategy for its VEBA trusts is consistent with that described for its pension trusts in
Note 8. The current target asset allocation is 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities. The Company currently expects to contribute approximately $17 million to its VEBA trusts during 2013.

There were no Level 3 assets during 2012 and 2011.

Postemployment

Under certain conditions,
the Company provides benefits to former or inactive employees, including salary continuance, severance, and long-term disability, in the United States and several foreign locations. The Company’s postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.
Actuarial assumptions used are generally consistent with those presented for pension benefits in Note 8. The aggregate change in accumulated postemployment benefit obligation and the net amount recognized were:

Components of postemployment benefit expense were:

The estimated net experience loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into postemployment benefit
expense over the next fiscal year is approximately $5 million.

Benefit payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

NOTE 10

MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

The Company contributes to multiemployer
defined contribution pension and postretirement benefit plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain unionized employee groups in the United States. Contributions to these plans are included in total pension and
postretirement benefit expense as reported in Notes 8 and 9, respectively.

Pension benefits

The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans. Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may
be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan are borne by the remaining participating employers.


The Company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans for the year ended December 29, 2012, is
outlined in the table below. The “EIN/PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN). The most recent Pension Protection Act (PPA) zone status available for 2012 and 2011 is for the plan
year-ends as indicated below. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded, plans in
the yellow zone are between 65 percent and 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. The “FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented” column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a
rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. In addition to regular plan contributions, the Company may be subject to a surcharge if the plan is in the red zone. The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether a
surcharge has been imposed on contributions to the plan. The last column lists the expiration date(s) of the collective-bargaining agreement(s) (CBA) to which the plans are subject.

(a)

The Company is party to multiple CBAs requiring contributions to this fund, each with its own expiration date. Over 70 percent of the Company’s participants in this fund are
covered by a single CBA that expires on 5/5/2013.

(b)

The Company is party to multiple CBAs requiring contributions to this fund, each with its own expiration date. Over 40 percent of the Company’s participants in this fund are
covered by a single CBA that expires on 7/27/2014.

(c)

The Company is party to multiple CBAs requiring contributions to this fund, each with its own expiration date. Over 40 percent of the Company’s participants in this fund are
covered by a single CBA that expires on 3/24/2018.

The Company was
listed in the Forms 5500 of the following plans as of the following plan year ends as providing more than 5 percent of total contributions:

At the date the Company’s financial statements were issued, Forms 5500 were not available for the plan years ending after
June 30, 2012.

In addition to regular contributions, the Company could be obligated to pay additional amounts, known as a withdrawal liability, if
a multiemployer pension plan has unfunded vested benefits and the Company decreases or ceases participation in that plan. The Company has recognized net estimated withdrawal expense related to curtailment and special termination benefits associated
with the Company’s withdrawal from certain multiemployer plans aggregating (in millions): 2012 – $(5); 2011 – $5; 2010 – $5.

During 2012 and 2011, the withdrawal liabilities recognized in 2011 and prior years were updated to reflect more recent information concerning the status of the
affected plan(s) and the Company’s current expectation of the impact of withdrawal. During 2011, the withdrawal liabilities recorded in 2010 and prior year were settled for approximately $11 million. The final calculation of the withdrawal
liability initially recognized in 2011 and updated in 2012 is pending the finalization of certain plan year-related data and is therefore subject to adjustment. The associated cash obligation is payable over a maximum 20 year period; management has
not determined the actual period over which the payments will be made.


Postretirement benefits

Multiemployer postretirement benefit plans provide health care and other welfare benefits to active and retired employees who have met certain age and service requirements. Contributions to multiemployer
postretirement benefit plans were (in millions): 2012 – $13; 2011 – $14; 2010 – $14.

NOTE 11

INCOME TAXES

The components
of income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes were as follows:

The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and the Company’s effective income tax rate was:

As presented in the preceding table, the Company’s 2012 consolidated effective tax rate was 27.4%, as compared to 27.0% in
2011 and 28.5% in 2010. The 2012 effective income tax rate benefited from the elimination of a tax liability related to certain international earnings now considered indefinitely reinvested.

As of December 29, 2012, the Company had recorded a deferred tax liability of $5 million related to $258 million of earnings. Accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $1.7 billion, primarily in Europe,
were considered indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, deferred income taxes have not been provided on these earnings and it is not practical to estimate the deferred tax impact of those earnings.

The 2011 effective income tax rate benefited from an international legal restructuring reflected in the cost (benefit) of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings.
During the third quarter of 2011, the Company recorded a benefit of $7 million from the decrease in the statutory rate in the United Kingdom.

The 2010
effective income tax rate was impacted primarily by the remeasurement of liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Authoritative guidance related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions requires the Company to remeasure its liabilities for
uncertain tax positions based on information obtained during the period, including interactions with tax authorities. Based on these interactions with tax authorities in various state and foreign jurisdictions, the Company reduced certain
liabilities for uncertain tax positions by $42 million and increased others by $13 million in 2010. The other line item contains the benefit from an immaterial correction of an item related to prior years that was booked in the first quarter of
2010, as well as the U.S. research and development tax credit.

Changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on
the effective income tax rate result from management’s assessment of the Company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration. Valuation allowances were recorded to
reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future. The total tax benefit of carryforwards at year-end 2012 and 2011 were $61 million and $41 million, respectively, with related valuation
allowances at year-end 2012 and 2011 of $50 and $38 million. Of the total carryforwards at year-end 2012, $3 million expire in 2014, $3 million in 2015 and the remainder expiring thereafter.


The following table provides an analysis of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end
2012 and 2011. Deferred tax assets on employee benefits increased in 2012 due to discount rate reductions associated with the Company’s pension and postretirement plans. Additionally, the deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings
decreased by $20 million due to foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested.

The change in valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets was:

Cash paid for income taxes was (in millions): 2012–$508; 2011–$271; 2010–$409. Income tax benefits realized from
stock option exercises and deductibility of other equity-based awards are presented in Note 7.

Uncertain tax positions

The Company is subject to federal income taxes in the U.S. as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s annual
provision for U.S. federal income taxes represents approximately 70% of the Company’s consolidated income tax provision. The Company was chosen to participate in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Compliance Assurance Program (CAP)
beginning with the 2008 tax year. As a result, with limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by the IRS for years prior to 2012. The Company is under examination for income and non-income tax filings in
various state and foreign jurisdictions. Spanish tax authorities have issued assessments for the 2005 and 2006 tax years related to intercompany activity. The Company has appealed to the Spanish tax court and does not anticipate the resolution will
have a material impact to its financial position.

As of December 29, 2012, the Company has classified $21 million of unrecognized tax
benefits as a current liability. Management’s estimate of reasonably possible changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months is comprised of the current liability balance expected to be settled within one year, offset by
approximately $9 million of projected additions related primarily to ongoing intercompany transfer pricing activity. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant additional payments, accruals, or
other material deviation in this estimate.

Following is a reconciliation of the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the years
ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011. For the 2012 year, approximately $59 million represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate in future
periods.

For the year ended December 29, 2012, the Company recognized an increase of $4 million of tax-related interest and
penalties and had $19 million accrued at year end. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized a decrease of $3 million of tax-related interest and penalties and had approximately $16 million accrued at
December 31, 2011. For the year ended January 1, 2011, the Company recognized an increase of $2 million of tax-related interest and penalties and had approximately $26 million accrued at January 1, 2011.


NOTE 12

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company is exposed to certain market
risks such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices, which exist as a part of its ongoing business operations. Management uses derivative financial and commodity instruments, including futures, options, and
swaps, where appropriate, to manage these risks. Instruments used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.

The Company designates derivatives as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges, and uses other contracts to reduce volatility in interest rates,
foreign currency and commodities. As a matter of policy, the Company does not engage in trading or speculative hedging transactions.

Total notional
amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were as follows:

Following is a description of each category in the fair value hierarchy and the financial assets and liabilities of the Company
that were included in each category at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, measured on a recurring basis.

Level 1 —

Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. For the Company, level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of commodity derivative
contracts.

Level 2 —

Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model
inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. For the Company, level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of interest rate swaps and over-the-counter commodity and currency
contracts.

The Company’s calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms
of the contract and the interest rate curve. Over-the-counter commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Foreign currency contracts are
valued using an income approach based on forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The Company’s calculation of the fair value of level 2 financial assets and liabilities takes into consideration the risk of
nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk.

Level 3 —

Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or
valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the
asset or liability. The Company did not have any level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of December 29, 2012 or December 31, 2011.


The following table presents assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet on a recurring basis as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011:

Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:

(a)

The fair value of the related hedged portion of the Company’s long-term debt, a level 2 liability, was $2.3 billion as of December 29, 2012 and $626 million as of
December 31, 2011:

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:


The effect of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended December 29,
2012 and December 31, 2011 were as follows:

Derivatives in fair value hedging relationships

(a)

Includes the ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing.

Derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships

(a)

Includes the ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing.

Derivatives in net investment hedging relationships

During the next 12 months, the Company expects $6 million of
net deferred losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) at December 29, 2012 to be reclassified to income, assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities.

Certain of the Company’s derivative instruments contain provisions requiring the Company to post collateral on those derivative instruments that are in a
liability position if the Company’s credit rating falls below BB+ (S&P), or Baa1 (Moody’s). The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability position on December 29, 2012 was
$25 million. If the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 29, 2012, the Company would be required


to post collateral of $25 million. In addition, certain derivative instruments contain provisions that would be triggered in the event the Company defaults on its debt agreements. There were no
collateral posting requirements as of December 29, 2012 triggered by credit-risk-related contingent features.

Other fair value
measurements

Level 3 assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at December 29, 2012 consisted of long-lived assets.

The Company’s calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on market comparables, market trends and the condition of the assets. Long-lived
assets with a carrying amount of $28 million were written down to their fair value of $11 million at December 29, 2012, resulting in an impairment charge of $17 million, which was included in earnings for the period.

The following table presents level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a nonrecurring basis as of December 29,
2012:

Counterparty credit risk concentration

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on derivative financial and commodity contracts. Management believes a concentration of credit risk with respect to derivative
counterparties is limited due to the credit ratings and use of master netting and reciprocal collateralization agreements with the counterparties and the use of exchange-traded commodity contracts.

Master netting agreements apply in situations where the Company executes multiple contracts with the same counterparty. Certain counterparties represent a
concentration of credit risk to the Company. If those counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of derivative contracts, this would result in a loss to the Company of $35 million as of December 29, 2012.

For certain derivative contracts, reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury
securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the Company or its counterparties exceeds a certain amount. As of December 29, 2012, the Company received $8 million cash collateral from a counterparty, which was reflected as a
decrease in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Management believes concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
limited due to the generally high credit quality of the Company’s major customers, as well as the large number and geographic dispersion of smaller customers. However, the Company conducts a disproportionate amount of business with a small
number of large multinational grocery retailers, with the five largest accounts encompassing approximately 30% of consolidated trade receivables at December 29, 2012.

Refer to Note 1 for disclosures regarding the Company’s accounting policies for derivative instruments.

NOTE 13

PRODUCT RECALL

During 2012 and 2010, the Company recorded charges in connection with product recalls. The Company recorded estimated customer returns and consumer rebates as a
reduction of net sales, costs associated with returned product and the disposal and write-off of inventory as COGS, and other recall costs as SGA expense.

On October 8, 2012, the Company announced a recall of certain packages of

Mini-Wheats

cereal in the U.S. and Canada due to the possible presence of fragments of flexible metal mesh from a faulty
manufacturing part.

On June 25, 2010, the Company announced a recall of select packages of Kellogg’s cereal primarily in the U.S. due to an
odor from waxy resins found in the package liner.

The following table presents a summary of charges related to the above recalls for the years ended
December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011:

In addition to charges recorded in connection with the 2010 recall, the Company also lost sales of the impacted products that are
not included in the table above.


NOTE 14

CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and governmental
inspections or investigations in the ordinary course of business covering matters such as general commercial, governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability, environmental, intellectual property, workers’
compensation, employment and other actions. These matters are subject to uncertainty and the outcome is not predictable with assurance. The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’
compensation, general liability, automobile liability and product liability.

The Company has established accruals for certain matters where losses are
deemed probable and reasonably estimable. There are other claims and legal proceedings pending against the Company for which accruals have not been established. It is reasonably possible that some of these matters could result in an unfavorable
judgment against the Company and could require payment of claims in amounts that cannot be estimated at December 29, 2012. Based upon current information, management does not expect any of the claims or legal proceedings pending against the
Company to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

Kellogg Company is the world’s leading producer of cereal, second
largest producer of cookies and crackers and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods. Additional product offerings include toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and
marketed globally. Principal markets for these products include the United States and United Kingdom.

The Company has the following reportable
segments: U.S. Morning Foods and Kashi; U.S. Snacks; U.S. Specialty; North America Other; Europe; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. The Company manages its operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category
or geographic location. These operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if
they can be aggregated into reportable segments. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail below.

U.S. Morning Foods and Kashi
aggregates the U.S. Morning Foods and U.S. Kashi operating segments. The U.S. Morning Foods operating segment includes cereal, toaster pastries, and health and wellness business generally marketed under the Kellogg’s name. The U.S.
Kashi operating segment represents Kashi branded cereal, cereal bars, crackers, cookies and Stretch Island fruit snacks.

U.S. Snacks represents the
U.S. snacks business which includes products such as cookies, crackers, cereal bars, savory snacks and fruit-flavored snacks.

U.S. Specialty primarily
represents the food service and Girl Scouts business. The food service business is mostly non-commercial, serving institutions such as schools and hospitals.

North America Other represents the U.S. Frozen and Canada operating segments. As these operating segments are not considered economically similar enough to aggregate with other operating segments and are
immaterial for separate disclosure, they have been grouped together as a single reportable segment.

The three remaining reportable segments are based
on geographic location – Europe which consists principally of European countries; Latin America which is comprised of Central and South America and includes Mexico; and Asia Pacific which is comprised of South Africa, Australia and other Asian
and Pacific markets.

The measurement of reportable segment results is based on segment operating profit which is generally consistent with the
presentation of operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Intercompany transactions between operating segments were insignificant in all periods presented.

As discussed in Note 1, in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has elected to modify its allocation of pension and postretirement benefit plan costs to reportable segments for management evaluation and
reporting purposes. All amounts have been adjusted to reflect the new policy.


Certain items such as interest expense and income taxes, while not included in the measure of reportable segment
operating results, are regularly reviewed by Management for the Company’s internationally-based reportable segments as shown below.

Management reviews balance sheet information, including total assets, based on geography. For all North American-based operating
segments, balance sheet information is reviewed by Management in total and not on an individual operating segment basis.

The Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated net
sales during 2012, 20% in 2011, and 21% in 2010, comprised principally of sales within the United States.

Supplemental geographic information is
provided below for net sales to external customers and long-lived assets:

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In February 2013, the Company issued $250 million of two-year floating-rate
U.S. Dollar Notes, and $400 million of ten-year 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes. The proceeds from these Notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including, together with cash on hand, repayment of the $750 million aggregate
principal amount of the Company’s 4.25% U.S. Dollar Notes due March 2013. The floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 23 basis points, subject to quarterly reset. The Notes contain customary covenants
that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions, as well as a change of control provision.

Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of the Company’s 2010 fiscal year. Gains and losses resulting from the
translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. Beginning January 1, 2011, the Company began using the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities
(SITME) rate to translate the Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars. In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced a 46.5% devaluation of the official exchange rate. Additionally, the SITME was eliminated.
Accordingly, in 2013 the Company will begin using the official exchange rate to translate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars. On a consolidated basis, Venezuela represents less than 2% of the
Company’s business.


Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes. We believe that the consolidated financial
statements present the Company’s financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States, using our best estimates and judgments as required.

The independent registered public accounting firm audits the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board and provides an objective, independent review of the fairness of reported operating results and financial position.

The board of directors of the Company has an Audit Committee composed of four non-management Directors. The Committee meets regularly with management, internal
auditors, and the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters.

Formal policies and procedures, including an active Ethics and Business Conduct program, support the internal controls and are designed to ensure employees adhere
to the highest standards of personal and professional integrity. We have a rigorous internal audit program that independently evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of these internal controls.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for designing, maintaining and evaluating adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As permitted by SEC guidance, management excluded from its assessment the May 31 acquisition of the Pringles business which accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated total assets and 6% of consolidated net
sales as of and for the year ended December 29, 2012.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 29, 2012. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which follows.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Kellogg Company

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Kellogg Company and its subsidiaries at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2012 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for pension and other nonpension postretirement benefits in 2012. All periods have been retroactively restated for this accounting change.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Pringles from its assessment of internal control
over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2012. We have also excluded Pringles from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Pringles is a
wholly-owned business whose total assets and total revenues represent 18% and 6%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 29, 2012.


ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

(a) We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

As of December 29, 2012, management carried out an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. We acquired Pringles during the
second quarter of 2012, which represented approximately 18% of our total assets as of December 29, 2012. As the acquisition occurred during the second quarter of 2012, the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and
procedures does not include Pringles. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from our scope in the year of acquisition. Based on the foregoing, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

(b) Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
we have included a report of management’s assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The independent registered public accounting firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also attested to, and reported on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report and the independent registered public accounting firm’s attestation report are included
in our 2012 financial statements in Item 8 of this Report under the captions entitled “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” and
are incorporated herein by reference.

(c) During the first quarter of 2012, we initiated the implementation of an upgrade to our existing
enterprise resource planning (ERP) system within North America. This implementation has resulted in the modification of certain business processes and internal controls impacting financial reporting. During the implementation, which is expected to
continue into 2014, we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls impacting financial reporting. It is anticipated that, upon completion, implementation of this new ERP will enhance internal controls due to
increased automation and further integration of related processes.

There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
