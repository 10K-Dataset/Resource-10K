PART I

Item 1.

Business

The Company.

Kellogg
Company, incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries
are engaged in the manufacture and marketing of ready-to-eat
cereal and convenience foods.

The address of the principal business office of
Kellogg Company is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599,
Battle Creek, Michigan Creek 49016-3599. Unless otherwise
specified or indicated by the context, the term
“Company” as used in this report means Kellogg
Company, its divisions and subsidiaries.

Information about the Keebler Foods Company
acquisition is incorporated by reference from “Keebler
acquisition” on page 25 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Financial Information About Segments.

The information called for by this
Item is incorporated herein by reference from Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 46 and 47 of the
Company’s Annual Report.

Principal Products.

The principal products of the Company
are ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, such as cookies,
crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, frozen waffles, meat
alternatives, pie crusts, and ice cream cones. These products
were, as of December 28, 2002, manufactured by the Company
in 19 countries and marketed in more than 180 countries.
The Company’s cereal products are generally marketed under
the

Kellogg’s

name and are sold principally
to the grocery trade through direct sales forces for resale to
consumers. The Company uses broker and distribution arrangements
for certain products. It also generally uses these, or similar
arrangements, in less-developed market areas or in those market
areas outside of its focus.

The Company also markets cookies, crackers, and
other convenience foods, under brands such as

Kellogg’s, Keebler, Cheez-It, Murray,

and

Famous Amos

, to supermarkets in the United States
through a direct store door (DSD) delivery system, although
other distribution methods are also used.

Additional information pertaining to the relative
sales of the Company’s products for the years 2000 through
2002 is found in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 46 and 47 of the Company’s Annual
Report.

Raw Materials.

Agricultural commodities are the
principal raw materials used in the Company’s products.
Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging
materials used by the Company. World supplies and prices of such
commodities (which include such packaging materials) are
constantly monitored, as are government trade policies. The cost
of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government
policy and regulation, weather conditions, or other unforeseen
circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and
improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes
of the Company’s short-term and long-term requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products
produced by the Company in the United States include corn grits,
wheat and wheat derivatives, oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate,
soybeans and soybean derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners,
flour, shortening, dairy products, eggs, and other filling
ingredients, which ingredients are obtained from various
sources. Most of these commodities are purchased principally
from sources in the United States.

The Company both enters into long-term contracts
for the commodities described in this section and purchases
these items on the open market, depending on the Company’s
view of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and the
Company’s relative negotiating power. While the cost of
some of these commodities has, and may continue to, increase
over time, the Company believes that it will be able to purchase
an adequate supply of these items as needed. The Company also
uses commodity futures and options to hedge some of its costs.



Raw materials and packaging needed for
internationally based operations are available in adequate
supply and are sometimes imported from countries other than
those where used in manufacture.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and
international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or
propane, commodities obtained from local utilities or other
local suppliers. Short-term standby propane storage exists at
several plants for use in the event of interruption in natural
gas supplies. Oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at
various plants in the event of natural gas shortages or when its
use presents economic advantages. In addition, considerable
amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the
distribution of the Company’s products.

Trademarks and Technology.

Generally, the Company’s products
are marketed under trademarks it owns. The Company’s
principal trademarks are its housemarks, brand names, slogans,

The slogans

The Best To You Each Morning,
The Original and Best, They’re Gr-r-reat!,

and

Eat it For Breakfast, Eat it For Life,

used in
connection with the Company’s ready-to-eat cereals, along
with

L’ Eggo my Eggo,

used in connection
with the Company’s frozen waffles and pancakes, and

Elfin Magic

used by the Keebler Foods subsidiary
in connection with convenience food products are also important
Company trademarks.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when
taken as a whole, are important to the Company’s business.
Certain individual trademarks are also important to the
Company’s business. Depending on the jurisdiction,
trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or
their registrations are properly maintained and they have not
been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks
can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the
trademarks are in use.

The Company considers that, taken as a whole, the
rights under its various patents, which expire from time to
time, are a valuable asset, but the Company does not believe
that its businesses are materially dependent on any single
patent or group of related patents. The Company’s
activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions
which it holds are similarly a valuable asset, but are not
believed to be material.

Seasonality.

Demand
for the Company’s products has generally been approximately
level throughout the year, although some of the Company’s
convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second
half of the year due to events and holidays. The Company also
custom-bakes cookies for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., which
are principally sold in the first quarter of the year.

Working Capital.

Although terms vary around the world,
in the United States the Company generally has required payment
for goods sold 11 days subsequent to the date of invoice,
generally with a 2% or 1% discount allowed for payment within
ten days. Receipts from goods sold, supplemented as
required by borrowings, provide for the Company’s payment
of dividends, capital expansion, and for other operating
expenses and working capital needs.

Customers.

The
Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 12% of consolidated
net sales during 2002, comprised principally of sales within the
United States. Correspondingly, at December 28, 2002,
approximately 9% of the Company’s consolidated receivables
balance and 13% of the Company’s U.S. receivables balance
was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
subsidiaries. During 2002, the Company’s top five
customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 30% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales and approximately 40% of
U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide
consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and the
Company believes that this trend is likely to continue. Although
the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time
could negatively impact the Company’s sales and profits,
the Company does not anticipate that this will occur to a
significant extent due to the consumer demand for the
Company’s products and the Company’s relationships
with its customers. Products of the Company have been generally
sold through its own sales forces and through broker and
distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to
consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service
establishments.

Backlog.

For the
most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and
are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The
backlog of any unfilled orders at December 28, 2002, and
December 31, 2001, was not material to the Company.

Competition.

The
Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience,
intense competition for sales of all of its principal products
in its major product categories, both domestically and
internationally. The Company’s products compete with
advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as
unadvertised and private label products, which are typically
distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food
products. Principal methods and factors of competition include
new product introductions, product quality, composition and
nutritional value, price, advertising, and promotion.

Research and Development.

Research to support and expand the use
of the Company’s existing products and to develop new food
products is carried on at the W.K. Kellogg Institute for Food
and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at other
locations around the world. The Company’s expenditures for



research and development were approximately
$106.4 million in 2002, $110.2 million in 2001, and
$118.4 million in 2000.

Regulation.

The
Company’s activities are subject to regulation by various
government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration,
Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, and
Department of Commerce in the United States, and various state
and local agencies, as well as similar agencies outside of the
United States.

Environmental Matters.

The Company’s facilities are
subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and
regulations regarding the discharge of material into the
environment and the protection of the environment in other ways.
The Company is not a party to any material proceedings arising
under these regulations. The Company believes that compliance
with existing environmental laws and regulations will not
materially affect the consolidated financial condition or the
competitive position of the Company. The Company is currently in
substantial compliance with all material environmental
regulations affecting the Company and its properties.

Employees.

At
December 28, 2002, the Company had approximately 25,700
employees.

Forward-Looking Statements.

This Report contains, or incorporates
by reference, “forward-looking statements” with
projections concerning, among other things, the Company’s
strategy and plans; exit plans and costs related to the Keebler
acquisition; growth, margins and profitability; products and
promotions; the impact of accounting changes; our ability to
meet interest and debt principal repayment obligations; working
capital; future common stock purchases; effective income tax
rate; cash flow; property addition expenditures; interest
expense; commodity prices; health care and pension costs; and
realizability of the carrying value of intangibles and other
assets. Forward-looking statements include predictions of future
results or activities and may contain the words
“expect,” “believe,” “will,”
“will deliver,” “anticipate,”

found in this Item 1 and in several sections of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis incorporated by
reference. The Company’s actual results or activities may
differ materially from these predictions. In particular, future
results or activities could be affected by factors related to
the Keebler acquisition, including integration problems,
failures to achieve synergies, unanticipated liabilities, and
the substantial amount of indebtedness incurred to finance the
acquisition, which could, among other things, hinder the
Company’s ability to adjust rapidly to changing market
conditions, make the Company more vulnerable in the event of a
downturn, and place the Company at a competitive disadvantage in
relation to less-leveraged competitors. The Company’s
future results could be affected by a variety of other factors,
including competitive conditions in our markets and categories
and their impact; pricing and promotional and marketing spending
levels and/or incremental pricing actions by the Company or
others and their effect on actual volumes and product mix;
actual market performance of benefit plan trust investments; the
effectiveness of advertising and marketing spending or programs;
the success of innovations and new product introductions; the
levels of spending on system initiatives, properties, business
opportunities, integration of acquired businesses, and other
general and administrative costs; the availability of and
interest rates on short-term financing; changes in consumer
behavior and preferences; commodity prices and labor costs; U.S.
and foreign economic conditions, including currency conversion
controls and rate fluctuations; business disruption from
terrorist acts or political unrest or responses to them; changes
in U.S. or foreign regulations affecting the food industry; the
success of productivity improvements and business



transitions; legal factors; and other items.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were
made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly
update them.

Item 2.

Properties

The Company’s corporate headquarters and
principal research and development facilities are located in
Battle Creek, Michigan.

The Company operated, as of December 28,
2002, manufacturing plants and warehouses totaling more than
18 million (18,000,000) square feet of building area in the
United States and other countries. The Company’s plants
have been designed and constructed to meet its specific
production requirements, and the Company periodically invests
money for capital and technological improvements. At the time of
its selection, each location was considered to be favorable,
based on the location of markets, sources of raw materials,
availability of suitable labor, transportation facilities,
location of other Company plants producing similar products, and
other factors. Manufacturing facilities of the Company in the
United States include four cereal plants and warehouses
located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania;
Memphis, Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska. The Company’s
United States convenience foods plants are located in
San Jose, California; Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus,

Guatemala, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea,

The principal properties of the Company,
including its major office facilities, generally are owned by

considers its facilities, taken as a whole, to be suitable,
adequate, and of sufficient capacity for its current operations.

PART IV

Item 14.

Controls
and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure based on
management’s interpretation of the definition of
“disclosure controls and procedures,” in
Rule 13a-14(c). In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Within 90 days prior to the date of this
report, management carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
foregoing, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.

There have been no significant changes in the
Company’s internal controls or in the other factors that
could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to
the date the Company completed its evaluation. Therefore, no
corrective actions were taken.
