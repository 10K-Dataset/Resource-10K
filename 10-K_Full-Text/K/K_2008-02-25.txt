PART 1.

ITEM  1.
    B

USINESS

The
    Company.

Kellogg Company, founded in 1906
    and incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries are
    engaged in the manufacture and marketing of ready-to-eat cereal
    and convenience foods.

The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company
    is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek,
    Michigan

49016-3599.

Unless otherwise specified or indicated by the context,
    “Kellogg,” “we,” “us” and
    “our” refer to Kellogg Company, its divisions and
    subsidiaries.

Financial Information About
    Segments.

Information on segments is
    located in Note 14 within Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements which are included herein under
    Part II, Item 8.

Principal
    Products.

Our principal products are
    ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, such as cookies,
    crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen
    waffles and veggie foods. These products were, as of
    February 22, 2008, manufactured by us in 18 countries
    and marketed in more than 180 countries. Our cereal products are
    generally marketed under the

Kellogg’s

name
    and are sold principally to the grocery trade through direct
    sales forces for resale to consumers. We use broker and
    distribution arrangements for certain products. We also
    generally use these, or similar arrangements, in less-developed
    market areas or in those market areas outside of our focus.

We also market cookies, crackers, and other convenience foods,
    under brands such as

Kellogg’s, Keebler, Cheez-It,
    Murray, Austin

and

Famous Amos,

to
    supermarkets in the United States through a direct store-door
    (DSD) delivery system, although other distribution methods are
    also used.

Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of our
    products for the years 2005 through 2007 is located in
    Note 14 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which are included herein under Part II,
    Item 8.

Raw
    Materials.

Agricultural commodities are
    the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard,
    corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials
    used by us. World supplies and prices of such commodities (which
    include such packaging materials) are constantly monitored, as
    are government trade policies. The cost of such commodities may
    fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation,
    weather conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances.
    Continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality
    and supply of such commodities for purposes of our short-term
    and long-term requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the
    United States include corn grits, wheat and wheat derivatives,
    oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean
    derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners, flour, vegetable oils,
    dairy products, eggs, and other filling ingredients, which are
    obtained from various sources. Most of these commodities are
    purchased principally from sources in the United States.

We enter into long-term contracts for the commodities described
    in this section and purchase these items on the open market,
    depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply
    levels, and our relative negotiating power. While the cost of
    some of these commodities has, and may continue to, increase
    over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an
    adequate supply of these items as needed. As further discussed
    herein under Part II, Item 7A, we also use commodity
    futures and options to hedge some of our costs.

Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based
    operations are available in adequate supply and are sometimes
    imported from countries other than those where used in
    manufacturing.

Natural gas and propane are the primary sources of energy used
    to power processing ovens at major domestic and international
    facilities, although certain locations may use oil or propane on
    a

back-up

or
    alternative basis. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel
    fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our
    products. As further discussed herein under Part II,
    Item 7A, beginning in 2006, we have used over-the-counter
    commodity price swaps to hedge some of our natural gas costs.

Trademarks and
    Technology.

Generally, our products are
    marketed under trademarks we own. Our principal trademarks are
    our housemarks, brand names, slogans, and designs related to
    cereals and convenience foods manufactured and marketed by us,

The slogans

,

and

,
    used in connection with our ready-to-eat cereals, along with

L’ Eggo my Eggo

, used in connection with
    our frozen waffles and pancakes, and

Elfin Magic

used in connection with convenience food products are
    also important Kellogg trademarks.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when taken as a
    whole, are important to our business. Certain individual
    trademarks are also important to our business. Depending on the
    jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are
    in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained and they have not been
    found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can
    also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks
    are in use.

We consider that, taken as a whole, the rights under our various
    patents, which expire from time to time, are a valuable asset,
    but we do not believe that our businesses are materially
    dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Our
    activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions
    which we hold are similarly a valuable asset, but are not
    believed to be material.

Seasonality.

Demand
    for our products has generally been approximately level
    throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods have
    a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to
    events and holidays. We also custom-bake cookies for the Girl
    Scouts of the U.S.A., which are principally sold in the first
    quarter of the year.

Working
    Capital.

Although terms vary around the
    world and by business types, in the United States we generally
    have required payment for goods sold eleven or sixteen days
    subsequent to the date of invoice as 2% 10/net 11 or 1%
    15/net 16. Receipts from goods sold, supplemented as
    required by borrowings, provide for our payment of dividends,
    capital expansion, and for other operating expenses and working
    capital needs.



Customers.

Our
    largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated net sales during
    2007, comprised principally of sales within the United States.
    At December 29, 2007, approximately 13% of our consolidated
    receivables balance and 21% of our U.S. receivables balance
    was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
    affiliates. During 2007, our top five customers, collectively,
    accounted for approximately 32% of our consolidated net sales
    and approximately 40% of U.S. net sales. There has been
    significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in
    recent years and we believe that this trend is likely to
    continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an
    extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and
    profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a
    significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products
    and our relationships with our customers. Our products have been
    generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker
    and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to
    consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service
    establishments.

Backlog.

For
    the most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt
    and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment.
    The backlog of any unfilled orders at December 29, 2007 and
    December 30, 2006, was not material to us.

Competition.

We
    have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense
    competition for sales of all of our principal products in our
    major product categories, both domestically and internationally.
    Our products compete with advertised and branded products of a
    similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label
    products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and
    generally with other food products. Principal methods and
    factors of competition include new product introductions,
    product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price,
    advertising, and promotion.

Research and
    Development.

Research to support and
    expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food
    products is carried on at the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food
    and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at other
    locations around the world. Our expenditures for research and
    development were approximately $179 million in 2007,
    $191 million in 2006 and $181 million in 2005.

Regulation.

Our
    activities in the United States are subject to regulation by
    various government agencies, including the Food and Drug
    Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the Departments of
    Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation
    by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate
    our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United
    States, including those of the European Union and various
    countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our
    activities.

Environmental
    Matters.

Our facilities are subject to
    various U.S. and foreign federal, state, and local laws and
    regulations regarding the discharge of material into the
    environment and the protection of the environment in other ways.
    We are not a party to any material proceedings arising under
    these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing
    environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect
    our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position.

Employees.

At
    December 29, 2007, we had approximately
    26,500 employees.

Financial Information About
    Geographic Areas.

Information on
    geographic areas is located in Note 14 within Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein
    under Part II, Item 8.

ACTORS

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report,
    the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely
    affect our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently
    known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair
    our business operations and financial condition.

Our performance is affected by general economic and political
    conditions and taxation policies.

Our results in the past have been, and in the future may
    continue to be, materially affected by changes in general
    economic and political conditions in the United States and other
    countries, including the interest rate environment in which we
    conduct business, the financial markets through which we access
    capital and currency, political unrest and terrorist acts in the
    United States or other countries in which we carry on business.

The enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added
    tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in
    markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the
    future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our
    products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or
    on our results of operations.

We operate in the highly competitive food industry.

We face competition across our product lines, including
    ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, from other companies
    which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market
    conditions. Some of our competitors have substantial financial,
    marketing and other resources, and competition with them in our
    various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce
    prices, increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or
    lose category share, any of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business and financial results. Category share and
    growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful
    in introducing new products.

Our consolidated financial results and demand for our
    products are dependent on the successful development of new
    products and processes.

There are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may
    impact us and the industry as a whole. These include changing
    consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute
    products.

Our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer
    preferences and on successful new product and process
    development and product relaunches in response to such changes.
    We aim to introduce products or new or improved production
    processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence
    and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote
    significant focus to the development of new products and to the
    research, development and technology process functions of our
    business, we may not be successful in developing new products or
    our



new products may not be commercially successful. Our future
    results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive
    position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of
    our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify,
    develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products
    in these changing markets.

An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other
    acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated
    operating results and net worth.

The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of
    acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and
    liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of
    other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, trade
    names, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition
    date. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to
    contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but
    must be evaluated by management at least annually for
    impairment. If carrying value exceeds current fair value, the
    intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value
    via a charge to earnings. Events and conditions which could
    result in an impairment include changes in the industries in
    which we operate, including competition and advances in
    technology; a significant product liability or intellectual
    property claim; or other factors leading to reduction in
    expected sales or profitability. Should the value of one or more
    of the acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated
    earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected.

As of December 29, 2007, the carrying value of intangible
    assets totaled approximately $4.97 billion, of which
    $3.52 billion was goodwill and $1.45 billion
    represented trademarks, tradenames, and other acquired
    intangibles compared to total assets of $11.4 billion and
    shareholders’ equity of $2.53 billion.

We may not achieve our targeted cost savings from cost
    reduction initiatives.

Our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient
    producer in a highly competitive industry. We have invested a
    significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our
    operational facilities. Ongoing operational issues are likely to
    occur when carrying out major production, procurement, or
    logistical changes and these, as well as any failure by us to
    achieve our planned cost savings, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business and consolidated financial position and
    on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness.

We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our
    shareholders’ equity. As of December 29, 2007, we had
    total debt of approximately $5.23 billion and
    shareholders’ equity of $2.53 billion.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences,
    including:

•

impairing the ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditure or general corporate purposes,
    particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by
    rating organizations were revised downward;

•

restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market
    conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a
    general downturn in economic conditions or our business;

•

requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations
    to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our
    debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes such
    as expansion through acquisitions, marketing spending and
    expansion of our product offerings; and

•

causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors,
    which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our
    obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our
    financial and operating performance, which in turn, is subject
    to prevailing economic conditions, the availability of, and
    interest rates on, short-term financing, and to financial,
    business and other factors beyond our control.

Our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a
    result of increases in the price of raw materials, including
    agricultural commodities, fuel and labor.

Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, soybean oil,
    sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our
    products. Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal
    packaging materials used by us. The cost of such commodities may
    fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation,
    weather conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. To the
    extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of
    such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or
    adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that
    offsets such changes, the results of our operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international
    facilities are regularly fuelled by natural gas or propane,
    which are obtained from local utilities or other local
    suppliers. Short-term stand-by propane storage exists at several
    plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies.
    Oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various
    plants. In



addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in
    connection with the distribution of our products. The cost of
    fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political
    conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other
    unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated operating results or financial
    condition.

A shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary
    pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could
    increase labor cost, which could have a material adverse effect
    on our consolidated operating results or financial conditions.

Additionally, our labor costs include the cost of providing
    benefits for employees. We sponsor a number of defined benefit
    plans for employees in the United States and various foreign
    locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active
    health care, severance and other postemployment benefits. We
    also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for
    certain of our manufacturing locations. Our major pension plans
    and U.S. retiree health and welfare plans are funded with
    trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of
    equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate
    and other investments. The annual cost of benefits can vary
    significantly from year to year and is materially affected by
    such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return
    on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount
    rate used to measure obligations, the rate or trend of health
    care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained
    wage and benefit agreements.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face
    of a consolidating retail environment. In addition, the loss of
    one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales
    and profits.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated net sales during
    2007, comprised principally of sales within the United States.
    At December 29, 2007, approximately 13% of our consolidated
    receivables balance and 21% of our U.S. receivables balance
    was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
    affiliates. During 2007, our top five customers, collectively,
    accounted for approximately 32% of our consolidated net sales
    and approximately 40% of U.S. net sales. As the retail
    grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become
    larger, our large retail customers may seek to use their
    position to improve their profitability through improved
    efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If
    we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product
    innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our
    profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. The
    loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could
    negatively impact our sales and profits.

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any
    inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products
    and brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, including
    particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also including
    patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to
    be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt
    to protect our intellectual property rights through a
    combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret
    laws, as well as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure
    and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of
    our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately
    protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products,
    or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that
    serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our
    intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and
    could materially harm our business.

We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that
    may cover some of our technology, brands or products. Any
    litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property
    could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the
    attention of our management and key personnel from our business
    operations. Third party claims of intellectual property
    infringement might also require us to enter into costly license
    agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or
    injunctions against development and sale of certain products.

Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure
    to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations
    and laws could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial condition.

Our activities, both in and outside of the United States, are
    subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and
    local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Federal Trade
    Commission, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce
    and Labor, as well as similar and other authorities of the
    European Union and various state, provincial and local
    governments, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies.
    Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities.

The manufacturing, marketing and distribution of food products
    are subject to governmental regulation that is becoming
    increasingly onerous. Those regulations control such matters as
    ingredients, advertising, relations with distributors and
    retailers, health and safety and the environment. We are also
    regulated with respect to matters such as licensing
    requirements,



trade and pricing practices, tax and environmental matters. The
    need to comply with new or revised tax, environmental or other
    laws or regulations, or new or changed interpretations or
    enforcement of existing laws or regulations, may have a material
    adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our operations face significant foreign currency exchange
    rate exposure which could negatively impact our operating
    results.

We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay
    expenses in a variety of currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian
    dollar, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Because our
    consolidated financial statements are presented in
    U.S. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities,
    revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable
    exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the
    value of the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of
    these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if
    their value has not changed in their original currency. To the
    extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure
    adequately, our consolidated results of operations may be
    negatively affected.

If our food products become adulterated or misbranded, we
    might need to recall those items and may experience product
    liability if consumers are injured as a result.

We may need to recall some of our products if they become
    adulterated or misbranded. We may also be liable if the
    consumption of any of our products causes injury. A widespread
    product recall could result in significant losses due to the
    costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and
    lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of
    time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product
    liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or
    product liability case could also result in a loss of consumer
    confidence in our food products, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business results and the value of our
    brands.

Technology failures could disrupt our operations and
    negatively impact our business.

We increasingly rely on information technology systems to
    process, transmit, and store electronic information. For
    example, our production and distribution facilities and
    inventory management utilize information technology to increase
    efficiencies and limit costs. Furthermore, a significant portion
    of the communications between our personnel, customers, and
    suppliers depends on information technology. Like other
    companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable
    to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control,
    including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist
    attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers,
    and other security issues. We have technology security
    initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place or in process
    to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities, but these
    measures may not be adequate.

ROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters and principal research and
    development facilities are located in Battle Creek, Michigan.

We operated, as of February 22, 2008,

manufacturing plants and distribution and warehousing facilities
    totaling more than 28 million square feet of building area
    in the United States and other countries. Our plants have been
    designed and constructed to meet our specific production
    requirements, and we periodically invest money for capital and
    technological improvements. At the time of its selection, each
    location was considered to be favorable, based on the location
    of markets, sources of raw materials, availability of suitable
    labor, transportation facilities, location of our other plants
    producing similar products, and other factors. Our manufacturing
    facilities in the United States include four cereal plants and
    warehouses located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster,
    Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska and other
    plants in San Jose, California; Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus,
    and Rome, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Kansas City, Kansas;
    Florence, Louisville, and Pikeville, Kentucky; Grand Rapids and
    Wyoming, Michigan; Blue Anchor, New Jersey; Cary and Charlotte,
    North Carolina; Cincinnati, Fremont, and Zanesville, Ohio;
    Muncy, Pennsylvania; Rossville, Tennessee; Clearfield, Utah; and
    Allyn, Washington.

Outside the United States, we had, as of February 22, 2008,
    additional manufacturing locations, some with warehousing
    facilities, in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador,
    Germany, Great Britain, Guatemala, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia,
    South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and Venezuela.

We generally own our principal properties, including our major
    office facilities, although some manufacturing facilities are
    leased, and no owned property is subject to any major lien or
    other encumbrance. Distribution facilities (including related
    warehousing facilities) and offices of non-plant locations
    typically are leased. In general, we consider our facilities,
    taken as a whole, to be suitable,



adequate, and of sufficient capacity for our current operations.

RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Overview

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader
    understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present
    business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to,
    and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated
    financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto
    contained in Item 8 of this report.

Kellogg Company is the world’s leading producer of cereal
    and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies,
    crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen
    waffles, and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and
    marketed globally. We currently manage our operations in four
    geographic operating segments, comprised of North America and
    the three International operating segments of Europe, Latin
    America, and Asia Pacific. Beginning in 2007, the Asia Pacific
    segment includes South Africa, which was formerly a part of
    Europe. Prior years were restated for comparison purposes.

We manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our
    long-term annual growth targets. During the periods presented
    these targets were low single-digit for internal net sales, low
    to mid single-digit for internal operating profit, and high
    single-digit for net earnings per share.

Our measure of “internal
    growth” excludes the impact of currency and, if applicable,
    acquisitions, dispositions, and shipping day differences.
    Specifically, internal net sales and operating profit growth for
    2005 exclude the impact of a 53rd shipping week in 2004.
    Internal operating profit growth for 2006 also excludes the
    impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) “Share-Based
    Payment.” Accordingly, internal operating profit growth for
    2006 is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is further discussed
    and reconciled to GAAP-basis growth on page 13.

(b)

At the beginning of 2006, we
    adopted SFAS No. 123(R) “Share-Based
    Payment,” which reduced our fiscal 2006 operating profit by
    $65 million ($42 million after tax or $.11 per share),
    due primarily to recognition of compensation expense associated
    with employee and director stock option grants. Correspondingly,
    our reported operating profit and net earnings growth for 2006
    was reduced by approximately 4%. Diluted net earnings per share
    growth was reduced by approximately 5%. Refer to the section
    beginning on page 24 entitled “

Stock
    compensation

” for further information on the
    Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

In combination with an attractive dividend yield, we believe
    this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong
    total return to our shareholders. We plan to continue to achieve
    this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our
    cereal business, expanding our snacks business, and pursuing
    selected growth opportunities. We support our business strategy
    with operating principles that emphasize profit-rich,
    sustainable sales growth

,

as well as cash flow and return
    on invested capital. We believe our steady earnings growth,
    strong cash flow, and continued investment during a multi-year
    period of significant commodity and energy-driven cost inflation
    demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model.

We measure the volume impact
    (tonnage) on revenues based on the stated weight of our product
    shipments.

During 2007, our consolidated net sales increased 8% on strong
    results from broad-based growth across our operating segments.
    Internal net sales grew over 5%, building on a 7% rate of
    internal growth during 2006. Successful innovation,
    brand-building (advertising and consumer promotion) investment
    and in-store



execution continued to drive broad-based sales growth across
    each of our enterprise-wide product groups. In fact, we achieved
    growth in retail cereal sales within each of our operating
    segments.

For 2007, our North America operating segment reported a net
    sales increase of 6%. Internal net sales grew over 5%, with each
    major product group contributing as follows: retail cereal +3%;
    retail snacks (cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars,
    fruit snacks) +7%; frozen and specialty (food service, club
    stores, vending, convenience, drug and value stores) channels
    +6%. The significant growth achieved by our North America snacks
    business built on internal growth of +11% in 2006. The 2007
    growth in North America retail cereal sales represented the
    7th consecutive year in which we’ve increased our
    dollar share of category sales.

Our International operating segments collectively achieved net
    sales growth of approximately 12% or 5% on an internal basis,
    with leading dollar contributions from our businesses in the UK,
    France, Mexico, and Venezuela. Internal sales of our Asia
    Pacific operating segment (which represents approximately 5% of
    our consolidated results) were approximately even with the prior
    year, as solid growth in Asian markets was offset by weak
    performance in our Australian business.

Consolidated operating profit for 2007 grew 6%, with internal
    operating profit up 3% versus 2006. For 2007, Europe contributed
    a strong 14% internal growth rate, driven by increased sales and
    stronger gross margins, as well as lower up-front costs. Despite
    a strong sales performance, operating profit in our North
    American segment was dampened by continued commodity cost
    pressures and significantly higher up-front costs associated
    with cost reduction initiatives, as more fully discussed on
    page 16. As previously predicted, our Latin America and
    Asia Pacific operating segments suffered operating profit
    declines, primarily driven by lower gross margins due to
    increased commodity costs, as well as the previously mentioned
    weak performance in our Australian business.

Our current-year operating profit growth was also affected by
    significant cost pressures as discussed in the “

Margin
    performance

” section beginning on page 14.
    Expenditures for brand-building activities increased at a mid
    single-digit rate; this rate of growth incorporates savings
    reinvestment from our recent focus on media buying efficiencies
    and global leverage of promotional campaigns. Within our total
    brand-building, advertising expenditures grew at a double-digit
    rate for 2007.

We measure the volume impact
    (tonnage) on revenues based on the stated weight of our product
    shipments.

During 2006, our consolidated net sales increased 7% on both an
    as-reported and internal basis, building on a 6% rate of
    internal growth during 2005.

For 2006, our North America operating segment reported a net
    sales increase of 8%. Internal net sales growth was also 8%,
    with each major product group contributing as follows: retail
    cereal +3%; retail snacks (cookies, crackers, toaster pastries,
    cereal bars, fruit snacks) +11%; frozen and specialty (food
    service, vending, convenience and drug stores, custom
    manufacturing) channels +8%. The significant growth achieved by
    our North America snacks business represented nearly one-half of
    the total dollar increase in consolidated internal net sales for
    2006. The 2006 growth in North America retail cereal sales was
    on top of 8% growth in 2005 and represented the
    6th consecutive year in which we’ve increased our
    dollar share of category sales. Although North America consumer
    retail cereal consumption remained steady throughout 2006, our
    shipment revenues declined in the fourth quarter of 2006 by
    approximately 2% versus the prior-year period. We believe this
    decline was largely attributable to year-end retail trade
    inventory adjustments, which brought inventories in line with
    year-end 2005 levels after several successive quarters of slight
    inclines.

Our International operating segments collectively achieved net
    sales growth of approximately 6% or 5% on an internal basis,
    with leading dollar contributions



from our UK, France, Mexico, and Venezuela business units.
    Internal sales of our Asia Pacific operating segment (which
    represents approximately 5% of our consolidated results) were
    approximately even with the prior year, as solid growth in
    Australia cereal and Asian markets was offset by weak
    performance in our Australia snack business.

Consolidated operating profit for 2006 grew 1%, with internal
    operating profit up 4% versus 2005. As discussed on
    page 12, our measure of internal operating profit growth is
    consistent with our measure of internal sales growth, except
    that during 2006, internal operating profit growth also excluded
    the impact of incremental stock compensation expense associated
    with our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We used this
    non-GAAP financial measure during our first year of adopting
    this FASB standard in order to assist management and investors
    in assessing the Company’s financial operating performance
    against comparative periods, which did not include stock
    option-related compensation expense. Accordingly, corporate
    selling, general, and administrative (SGA) expense was higher
    and operating profit was lower by $65 million for 2006,
    reducing consolidated operating profit growth by approximately
    four percentage points. Refer to the section beginning on
    page 24 entitled “

Stock compensation

” for
    further information on the Company’s adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Although total 2006 up-front costs of $82 million were not
    significantly changed from the 2005 amount of $90 million,
    a year-over-year shift in operating segment allocation of such
    costs affected relative segment performance. The 2006 versus
    2005 change in project cost allocation was a $44 million
    decline in North America (improving 2006 segment operating
    profit performance by approximately 4%) and a $28 million
    increase in Europe (reducing 2006 segment operating profit
    performance by approximately 8%).

For 2006, operating profit growth was affected by significant
    cost pressures as discussed in the “

Margin
    performance

” section. Expenditures for brand-building
    activities increased at a low single-digit rate; this rate of
    growth incorporates savings reinvestment from our recent focus
    on media buying efficiencies and global leverage of promotional
    campaigns. Within our total brand-building metric, advertising
    expenditures grew at a high single-digit rate for 2006.

(b)

Selling, general, and

We strive for gross profit dollar growth to reinvest in
    brand-building and innovation expenditures. Our strategy for
    increasing our gross profit is to manage external cost pressures
    through product pricing and mix improvements, productivity
    savings, and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of
    product ingredients and packaging. For 2007, our gross profit
    was up 7% over 2006, an increase of $350 million.

Our gross margin performance for 2006 and 2007 reflects the
    impact of significant fuel, energy, and commodity price
    inflation experienced throughout most of that time, as well as
    increased employee benefit costs in 2006. In the aggregate,
    these input cost pressures reduced our consolidated gross margin
    by approximately 155 basis points for 2007 and
    150 basis points in 2006. For 2006, our gross margin
    performance was also unfavorably impacted by incremental
    logistics and innovation

start-up

costs related to the significant sales growth within our North
    America operating segment.

The majority of the inflationary pressure during 2006 and 2007
    was commodity and energy-driven. Total active and retired
    employee benefits expense was approximately $285 million in
    2007 versus $325 million in 2006 and $290 million in
    2005. For 2008, the combined effect of favorable trust asset
    performance in prior years and rising discount rates is expected
    to have a moderating effect on underlying benefit cost
    inflation. As a result, we expect 2008 benefits expense to be
    approximately 10% lower than 2007.

For 2008, we expect inflationary trends to accelerate, with net
    input cost (fuel, energy, commodity, and benefits) pressures
    forecasted to exceed realized savings. As compared to 2007
    results, we currently expect incremental cost inflation,
    primarily associated with the prices of our 2008 ingredient
    purchases to be greater than $.65 per share. Accordingly, we
    believe our 2008 consolidated gross margin could decline by
    approximately 100 basis points which includes an
    approximately 40 basis point reduction related to our
    acquisitions and an approximately 30 basis point



reduction due to higher up-front costs expected in cost of goods
    sold.

In addition to external cost pressures, our discretionary
    investment in cost-reduction initiatives (refer to following
    section) has created variability in our gross margin performance
    during the periods presented. Although total annual
    program-related charges were relatively steady over the past
    several years, the amount recorded in cost of goods sold varied
    by year (in millions): 2007–$23; 2006–$74;
    2005–$90. Additionally, cost of goods sold for 2005
    includes a charge of approximately $12 million, related to
    a lump-sum payment to members of the major union representing
    the hourly employees at our U.S. cereal plants for
    ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the Company
    covering the four-year period ended October 2009.

For 2006 both our SGA% and operating margin were affected by our
    fiscal 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). During 2006,
    we reported incremental stock compensation expense of
    $65 million which increased our SGA% and reduced our
    operating margin by approximately 60 basis points in 2006.
    Refer to the section beginning on page 24 entitled
    “

Stock compensation

” for further information on
    this subject.

For 2007, our SGA% was negatively impacted by the reorganization
    of our direct store-door delivery (DSD) operations. Total
    program costs of $77 million were recorded in SGA expense,
    as discussed further in the “

Exit or disposal
    plans”

section.

Exit
    or disposal plans

We view our continued spending on cost-reduction initiatives as
    part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater
    visibility in meeting long-term growth targets. Initiatives
    undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation
    costs within a five-year period of completion. Each
    cost-reduction initiative is normally one to three years in
    duration. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed
    in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to
    deliver cash savings

and/or

reduced depreciation, which is then reinvested in the business.
    Certain of these initiatives represent exit or disposal plans
    for which material charges will be incurred. We include these
    charges in our measure and discussion of operating segment
    profitability within the

“Net sales and operating
    profit”

section beginning on page 12.

In 2006, we commenced a multi-year European manufacturing
    optimization plan to improve utilization of our facility in
    Manchester, England and to better align production in Europe.
    Based on forecasted foreign exchange rates, the Company
    currently expects to incur approximately $55 million in
    total up-front costs, including $28 million recorded in
    2006, and $19 million recorded in 2007, with the remainder
    to be incurred in 2008. The cost is comprised of approximately
    90% cash expenditures and 10% non-cash asset write-offs. The
    cash portion of the total up-front costs results principally
    from management’s plan to eliminate approximately
    220 hourly and salaried positions from the Manchester
    facility by the end of 2008 through voluntary early retirement
    and severance programs. The pension trust funding requirements
    of these early retirements are expected to exceed the recognized
    benefit expense impact by approximately $5 million; most of
    this incremental funding occurred in 2006. During the program,
    certain manufacturing equipment will also be removed from
    service.

All of the costs for the European manufacturing optimization
    plan have been recorded in cost of goods sold within the
    Company’s European operating segment. The following tables
    present total project costs to date and a reconciliation of
    employee severance reserves for this initiative. All other cash

In October 2007, we committed to reorganize certain production
    processes between our plants in Valls, Spain and Bremen,
    Germany. Commencement of this plan follows consultation with
    union representatives at the Bremen facility regarding the
    elimination of approximately 120 employee positions. This
    reorganization plan is specifically intended to improve
    manufacturing and distribution efficiency across our continental
    European operations, and is expected to be completed by mid
    2008. Based on forecasted foreign exchange rates, we expect to
    incur approximately $25 million of total project costs,
    comprised of approximately 50% asset write-offs and 50% employee
    separation benefits and other cash costs. The Company recorded
    $4 million of costs in 2007, with the remaining to be
    incurred in 2008.



All of the costs for the European production process realignment
    have been recorded in cost of goods sold within the
    Company’s European operating segment.

In July 2007, management commenced a plan to reorganize the
    Company’s direct store-door delivery (DSD) operations in
    the southeastern United States. This DSD reorganization plan is
    intended to integrate the Company’s southeastern sales and
    distribution regions with the rest of its U.S. direct
    store-door operations, resulting in greater efficiency across
    the nationwide network. In preparation for this initiative, in
    June 2007, the Company began to extend offers to exit
    approximately 517 distribution route franchise agreements with
    independent contractors, which were substantially accepted as of
    July 2007. The plan resulted in the involuntary termination or
    relocation of approximately 300 employee positions. Total
    project costs incurred were $77 million, principally
    consisting of cash expenditures for route franchise settlements
    and to a lesser extent, for employee separation, relocation, and
    reorganization. This initiative was substantially complete by
    the end of 2007.

All of the costs for the U.S. DSD reorganization plan have
    been recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense
    within the Company’s North America operating segment. The
    following tables present total project costs to date. Exit cost
    reserves were approximately $3 million as of
    December 29, 2007, primarily related to lease termination
    costs. All other cash costs were paid in the period incurred.

During 2006, we implemented several short-term initiatives to
    enhance the productivity and efficiency of our U.S. cereal
    manufacturing network and streamlined our sales distribution
    system in a Latin American market. In 2005, we undertook an
    initiative to consolidate U.S. snacks bakery capacity,
    resulting in the closure and sale of two facilities by mid 2006.
    These initiatives were substantially complete at
    December 30, 2006. Details of each initiative are described
    in Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

For 2007, the Company recorded total program-related charges of
    approximately $100 million, comprised of $7 million of
    asset write-offs, $72 million for severance and other exit
    costs including route franchise settlements, $15 million
    for other cash expenditures, and $6 million for a
    multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability. Approximately
    $23 million of the total 2007 charges were recorded in cost
    of goods sold within the Europe operating segment results, with
    approximately $77 million recorded in SGA expense within
    the North America operating results.

For 2006, the Company recorded total program-related charges of
    approximately $82 million, comprised of $20 million of
    asset write-offs, $30 million for severance and other exit
    costs, $9 million for other cash expenditures,
    $4 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal
    liability, and $19 million for pension and other
    postretirement plan curtailment losses and special termination
    benefits. Approximately $74 million of the total 2006
    charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within operating
    segment results, with approximately $8 million recorded in
    SGA expense within corporate results. The Company’s
    operating segments were impacted as follows (in millions): North
    America-$46; Europe-$28.

For 2005, total program-related charges were approximately
    $90 million, comprised of $16 million for a
    multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability,
    $44 million of asset write-offs, $21 million in
    severance and other exit costs, and $9 million for other
    cash expenditures. All of the charges were recorded in cost of
    goods sold within our North America operating segment.



For the periods presented, cash requirements to implement these
    programs approximated the exit costs and other cash charges
    incurred in each year, except for approximately $8 million
    of incremental pension trust funding that occurred in 2006 in
    connection with the European manufacturing optimization plan. At
    December 29, 2007, the Company’s remaining cash
    commitments to complete the executed programs were comprised of:
    exit cost reserves of $5 million expected to be paid out in
    2008; and estimated multiemployer pension plan withdrawal
    liabilities of $26 million, which will not be finally
    determined until 2008 and once determined, are payable to the
    pension fund over a

20-year

maximum period. We expect these cash requirements to be funded
    by operating cash flow.

Our 2008 earnings target includes total projected charges
    related to in-progress and potential cost-reduction initiatives
    of approximately $80 million or $.14 per share.
    Approximately one-third of this total is allocated to the
    aforementioned European projects. However, the specific cash
    versus non-cash mix or cost of goods sold versus SGA expense
    impact of the remainder has not yet been determined. Other
    potential initiatives to be commenced in 2008 are still in the
    planning stages and individual actions will be announced as we
    commit to these discretionary investments.

Interest
    expense

As illustrated in the following table, annual interest expense
    for the

2005-2007

period has been relatively steady, which reflects a stable
    effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant
    debt balance throughout most of that time. Interest income
    (recorded in other income) has trended upward from approximately
    $9 million in 2005 to $23 million in 2007, resulting
    in net interest expense of approximately $296 million for
    2007. We currently expect that our 2008 net interest
    expense will be comparable to the 2007 amount.

    Kellogg’s Corporate Citizenship Fund, a private trust
    established for charitable giving, as follows (in millions):
    2007–$12; 2006–$3; 2005–$16. Other expense for
    2005 also includes a charge of approximately $7 million to
    reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to
    estimated selling value. This facility was sold in August 2006.

Income
    taxes

Our long-term objective is to achieve a consolidated effective
    income tax rate of approximately 31%. In comparison to a
    U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, we pursue
    planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our
    target. Excluding the impact of discrete adjustments and the
    cost of repatriating foreign earnings, our sustainable
    consolidated effective income tax rate for 2005 was
    approximately 33%, with the rate for 2006 and 2007 at
    approximately 32%. We currently expect our 2008 sustainable rate
    to be approximately 31%, in line with our objective. Our
    reported rates of approximately 29% for 2007 and 31% for 2005
    were lower than the sustainable rate due to the favorable effect
    of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements,
    international restructuring initiatives and statutory rate
    changes. (Refer to Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information.) For 2008, we
    expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be
    approximately 31%. This could be impacted however, if pending
    uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be
    affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less
    favorably than we currently expect.



LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows,
    supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other
    significant transactions. This cash-generating capability is one
    of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial
    financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.
    During 2007, we believe our Company’s financial strength
    has been especially evident in the face of the recent
    U.S. sub-prime mortgage market crisis and its pervasive
    effect on general credit market liquidity. For the year, we
    continued to have access to the U.S. commercial paper
    market without significant increase in our effective short-term
    borrowing rate, and our commercial paper and term debt credit
    ratings have not been affected. Our annual interest expense for
    the

2005-2007

period has been relatively steady, which reflects a stable
    effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant
    debt balance throughout most of that time. We have not had any
    significant new borrowings under our Euro or Canadian commercial
    paper programs since June 2007, which has limited our exposure
    to

non-U.S. credit

market illiquidity during this turbulent period.

Operating
    activities

The principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings,
    meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of
    costs to manufacture and market our products. Our cash
    conversion cycle

(defined as days of inventory and trade
    receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding)

is relatively short; equating to approximately 27 days
    for the trailing

365-day

period ended December 29, 2007, an improvement to the
    comparable prior year period which was 29 days. As a
    result, our operating cash flow should generally reflect our net
    earnings performance over time, although, as illustrated in the
    following schedule, specific results for any particular year may
    be significantly affected by the level of benefit plan
    contributions, working capital movements (operating assets and
    liabilities) and other factors.

Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 was
    $93 million higher than the comparable period of 2006, due
    primarily to growth in cash-basis earnings and favorable total
    working capital performance. Operating cash flow for 2006 was
    approximately $267 million higher than 2005, due primarily
    to lower benefit plan contributions, partially offset by
    unfavorable working capital movements. The decline in benefit
    plan contributions for 2006 and 2007, as compared to 2005,
    reflects the improved funded position of our major benefit plans
    that was achieved through a significant amount of funding in the

2003-2005

period.

On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act (PPA) became
    law in the United States. The PPA revised the basis and
    methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding
    requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits
    paid from

tax-qualified

plans. Most of these provisions are first applicable to our
    U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2008 on a phased-in
    basis. The PPA will ultimately require us to make additional
    contributions to our U.S. plans. However, due to our
    historical funding practices, we currently believe that we will
    not be required to make any contributions under the new PPA
    requirements until after 2013. Accordingly, we do not expect to
    have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements
    for our major retiree benefit plans during the next several
    years, with total 2008 U.S. and foreign plan contributions
    currently estimated at approximately $63 million. Actual
    2008 contributions could exceed our current projections, as
    influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of
    our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities,
    future changes in government requirements, renewals of union
    contracts, or



higher-than-expected

health care claims cost experience. Additionally, our
    projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are
    subject to change primarily based on general market conditions
    affecting trust asset performance and our future decisions
    regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA.

As compared to 2006, the favorable movement in core working
    capital during 2007 was related principally to higher trade
    payables, which are due in part, to increased payment terms in
    international locations. During 2007, our trade payables balance
    increased by almost 19% from year end 2006. In contrast, our
    December 30, 2006 trade payables balance was within 3% of
    the balance at year-end 2005.

For the trailing fifty-two weeks ended December 29, 2007,
    core working capital was 6.8% of net sales, consistent with
    year-end 2006, as compared to 7.0% as of year-end 2005. We have
    been able to maintain this level through the timely collection
    of accounts receivable and extension of terms on trade payables,
    offset by slightly higher inventory levels.

In comparison to 2005, the unfavorable movement in core working
    capital during 2006 was related to trade payables performance
    and higher inventory balances. The higher inventory balance was
    principally related to higher commodity prices for our raw
    material and packaging inventories and to a lesser extent, the
    overall increase in the average number of weeks of inventory on
    hand. Our consolidated inventory balances were unfavorably
    affected by U.S. capacity limitations during 2006.

As presented in the table on page 18, other working capital
    was a use of cash in 2007 versus a source of cash in 2006. The
    difference relates to year-over-year increase in the amount of
    income tax payments. The favorable movement in other working
    capital in 2006 as compared to 2005 was attributable to several
    factors including lower debt-related currency swap payments in
    2006 as well as business-related growth in accrued compensation
    and promotional liabilities.

Investing
    activities

Our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash
    provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for
    property additions. We use this

non-GAAP

financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors
    on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend
    distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchase.
    Our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP
    measure, as follows:

Our cash flow (as defined) performance during the periods
    presented reflects increased spending for selected capacity
    expansions to accommodate our Company’s strong sales growth
    over the past several years. This increased capital spending
    represented 4.0% of net sales in 2007 and 4.2% of net sales in
    2006, as compared to 3.7% of net sales in 2005. For 2008, we
    currently expect property expenditures to remain at
    approximately 4.0% of net sales, which is consistent with our
    long-term target for capital spending. This forecast includes
    expenditures associated with the construction of a new
    manufacturing facility in Kutno, Poland and expansion of our
    global research center in Battle Creek, Michigan which together
    represents approximately 15% of our 2008 capital plan. The
    facility in Poland will help us meet consumer demand for our
    ready-to-eat cereals in the emerging Central and Eastern
    European markets. The expansion of the W. K. Kellogg
    Institute for Food and Nutrition Research reflects our
    commitment to research and innovation which is a key driver to
    the growth of our business.

For 2008, we are expecting cash flow to be broadly in line with
    our 2007 results. We expect to achieve our target principally
    through operating profit growth, and prudent management of our
    working capital.

As discussed in Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, our property additions for 2007 include
    approximately $16 million for the purchase of a previously
    leased snacks manufacturing facility in Chicago, Illinois.

As discussed in Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, in order to support the continued growth
    of our North America operating segment, the Company completed
    two separate business acquisitions in late 2007 for a total of
    approximately $123 million in cash, including related
    transaction costs. On November 1, 2007, a subsidiary of the
    Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in Bear Naked,
    Inc., a leading seller of premium-branded natural granola
    products. On November 5, 2007, the Company acquired certain
    assets and liabilities of the Wholesome & Hearty Foods
    Company, a U.S. manufacturer of veggie foods marketed under
    the
    Gardenburger

®

brand.



To expand the Company’s presence in Eastern Europe, on
    January 16, 2008, subsidiaries of the Company acquired
    substantially all of the equity interests in OJSC Kreker (doing
    business as “United Bakers”) and consolidated
    subsidiaries for approximately $117 million in cash,
    including transaction fees incurred to date, and $3 million
    in assumed debt. The Company expects to acquire the remaining
    minority interests through tender offers initiated during 2008.
    United Bakers is a leading producer of cereal, cookie, and
    cracker products in Russia, with 4,000 employees, six
    manufacturing facilities, and a broad distribution network. The
    business realized approximately $100 million of revenues in
    2007. (Due to various factors including accounting principle
    conformity, these revenues are not necessarily indicative of the
    pro forma incremental effect on the Company’s 2007
    consolidated net sales, assuming this business combination had
    been completed at the beginning of 2007.) The purchase agreement
    between the Company and the seller provides for the payment of a
    currently undeterminable amount of contingent consideration at
    the end of three years, provided certain financial performance
    metrics are achieved. Such payment would be recognized as
    additional purchase price when the contingency is resolved. As
    part of the aforementioned initial purchase price for this
    acquisition, the Company incurred approximately $5 million
    in transaction fees and cash advances during 2007, which we
    classified as business acquisition-related investing cash
    outflows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the
    year ended December 29, 2007.

In order to support the continued growth of our North American
    fruit snacks business, we completed two separate business
    acquisitions during 2005 for a total of approximately
    $50 million in cash, including related transaction costs.
    In June 2005, we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility
    and related assets from Kraft Foods Inc. The facility is located
    in Chicago, Illinois and employs approximately 400 active hourly
    and salaried employees. In November 2005, we acquired
    substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a
    Washington State-based manufacturer of natural and organic fruit
    snacks.

Financing
    activities

For 2007, our Board of Directors authorized stock repurchases
    for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for
    employee benefit programs of up to $650 million, which we
    spent to repurchase approximately 12 million shares.
    Pursuant to similar Board authorizations applicable to those
    years, we paid $650 million in 2006 to repurchase
    approximately 15 million shares, and $664 million in
    2005 to repurchase approximately 16 million shares. The
    2006 activity consisted principally of a February 2006 private
    transaction with the W. K. Kellogg Foundation Trust (“the
    Trust”) to repurchase approximately 13 million shares
    for $550 million. The 2005 activity consisted principally
    of a November 2005 private transaction with the Trust to
    repurchase approximately 9 million shares for
    $400 million. For 2008, our Board of Directors has
    authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $650 million.

Our Company paid dividends to shareholders in 2007 in the amount
    of $1.202 per common share. This represented a 5.7% increase
    from the previous level of $1.137 per common share paid in 2006.
    The increase was due to the Board’s authorization to pay
    quarterly dividends in the amount of $.31 per common share
    beginning in September, 2007. This increase is consistent with
    our current plan to maintain our dividend pay-out ratio between
    40% and 50% of reported net earnings.

In December 2007, the Company issued $750 million of
    five-year 5.125% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using the
    proceeds from these Notes to replace a portion of our
    U.S. commercial paper. These Notes were issued under an
    existing shelf registration statement. The effective interest
    rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount and swap
    settlement, is 5.12%. The Notes contain customary covenants that
    limit the ability of the Company and our restricted subsidiaries
    (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale
    and lease-back transactions as well as a change in control
    provision. Also in December, we redeemed approximately
    $72 million of notes issued in March, 2001, otherwise due
    in 2011.

During November 2005, subsidiaries of the Company issued
    approximately $930 million of foreign

currency-denominated

debt in offerings outside of the United States, consisting of
    Euro 550 million of floating rate notes due 2007 (the
    “Euro Notes”) and approximately C$330 million of
    Canadian commercial paper. These debt issuances were guaranteed
    by the Company and net proceeds were used primarily for the
    payment of dividends pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act
    and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect
    subsidiaries of the Company, as well as for general corporate
    purposes.

To utilize excess cash and reduce financing costs, on
    February 28, 2007, we redeemed the Euro Notes otherwise due
    May 2007, for $728 million. To partially refinance this
    redemption, we established a program to issue euro-commercial
    paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any
    time of $750 million or its equivalent in alternative
    currencies. The notes may have maturities ranging up to
    364 days and are senior unsecured obligations of the
    applicable issuer, with subsidiary issuances guaranteed by the
    Company.

In connection with these financing activities, we increased our
    short-term lines of credit from $2.2 billion at
    December 30, 2006 to approximately $2.6 billion at
    December 29, 2007. This increase was



achieved via a $400 million unsecured

364-Day

Credit Agreement effective January 31, 2007. The

364-Day

Agreement contains customary covenants, warranties, and
    restrictions similar to those applicable to our existing
    $2.0 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in
    2011. Our credit facilities are available for general corporate
    purposes, including commercial paper

back-up,

although we do not currently anticipate any draw-down of the
    facilities. (Refer to Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information on our debt
    issuances and credit facilities.) The $400 million Credit
    Agreement expired at the end of January, 2008 and the Company
    did not renew it.

At December 29, 2007, our total debt was approximately
    $5.2 billion, approximately even with the balance at
    year-end 2006. During 2006, we reduced the Company’s common
    stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately
    4%, and implemented a mid-year increase in the shareholder
    dividend level of approximately 5%. Similarly, during 2007, we
    further reduced our common stock outstanding through repurchase
    programs by approximately 3% and implemented a mid-year increase
    in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 6.5%.
    Primarily due to the prioritization of these uses of cash flow,
    the aforementioned need to selectively invest in production
    capacity, as well as pursue selective acquisition opportunities,
    we did not reduce our total debt balance during the past two
    years, but remain committed to net debt reduction (total debt
    less cash) over the long term. We currently expect the total
    debt balance at year-end 2008 to be slightly higher than the
    2007 year-end level.

Although we presently observe a general recovery of liquidity
    within the commercial paper market and improved pricing in the
    corporate bond market, we cannot reasonably predict the extent
    and duration of the continuing sub-prime mortgage market crisis,
    the economic environment, nor their potential indirect effect on
    our sector. However, we continue to believe that we will be able
    to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and
    maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while
    still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of
    selected bolt-on acquisitions, through our strong cash flow, our
    program of issuing short-term debt, and maintaining credit
    facilities on a global basis. Our significant long-term debt
    issues do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are
    dependent on credit ratings. A change in the Company’s
    credit ratings could limit our access to the
    U.S. short-term debt market

and/or

increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future.
    However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to
    have access to our aforementioned credit facilities. In
    addition, assuming continuation of the present market
    conditions, we believe it would be possible to term out certain
    short-term maturities or obtain additional credit facilities
    such that the Company could further extend its ability to meet
    its long-term borrowing obligations through 2008.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET
    ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS

Off-balance
    sheet arrangements

As of December 29, 2007 the Company did not have any
    off-balance sheet arrangements. As of December 30, 2006,
    our off balance sheet arrangements were limited to a residual
    value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately
    $13 million and guarantees on loans to independent
    contractors for their purchase of DSD route franchises up to
    $17 million. During 2007, we terminated the operating lease
    and purchased the facility. See Note 6 within the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
    Additionally, during 2007, we completed a program to reorganize
    the DSD operations resulting in the exiting of the route
    franchise agreements. See Note 3 within the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1
    within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

At the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year, we adopted the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation
    No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes” (FIN No. 48), which affects our process
    for estimating tax benefits and liabilities, as further
    discussed in the “

Income taxes

” section
    beginning on page 27. The initial application of
    FIN No. 48 resulted in a net decrease to accrued
    income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately
    $2 million, with an offsetting increase to retained
    earnings. Refer to Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information on
    FIN No. 48.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements” in order to establish a
    single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring
    fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
    that is intended to result in increased consistency and
    comparability in fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157
    also expands disclosures about fair value measurements, with the
    intention of improving the quality of information provided to
    users of financial statements. The standard applies whenever
    other authoritative literature requires (or permits) certain
    assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, but does not
    expand the use of fair value. SFAS No. 157 was
    originally effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those years with early adoption permitted. In
    early 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP)

FAS-157-2,

which delays by one year, the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for all

non-financial

assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The delay
    pertains to items including, but not limited to, non-financial
    assets and non-financial liabilities initially measured at fair
    value in a business combination, reporting units measured at
    fair value in the first step of evaluating goodwill for
    impairment under SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”, indefinite-lived intangible assets
    measured at fair value for impairment assessment under
    SFAS No. 142, and long-lived assets measured at fair
    value for impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of

Long-Lived

Assets”. We plan to adopt the portion of
    SFAS No. 157 that has not been delayed by FSP

FAS-157-2

as
    of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year, and plan to adopt the
    balance of its provisions as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal
    year. For the Company, balance sheet items carried at fair value
    on a recurring basis (to which SFAS No. 157 applies in
    2008) consist primarily of derivative financial
    instruments. Balance sheet items carried at fair value on a
    non-recurring basis (to which SFAS No. 157 will apply
    in 2009) consist of assets held for sale and exit
    liabilities. Relevant to the “

Intangibles

”
    section beginning on page 23, we also use fair value
    concepts to test various long-lived assets for impairment and to
    initially measure assets and liabilities acquired in a business
    combination. We do not currently expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 in 2008 to have a material effect on the
    measurement of the Company’s financial



assets and liabilities. We are continuing to evaluate the impact
    the standard will have on the determination of fair value
    related to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities in
    post-2008 years.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised
    2007) “Business Combinations” and SFAS
    No. 160 “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
    Financial Statements,” which are effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008. These new standards
    represent the completion of the FASB’s first major joint
    project with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
    and are intended to improve, simplify, and converge
    internationally the accounting for business combinations and the
    reporting of noncontrolling interests (formerly minority
    interests) in consolidated financial statements. We will adopt
    these standards at the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year. The
    effect of adoption will generally be prospectively applied to
    transactions completed after the end of our 2008 fiscal year,
    although the new presentation and disclosure requirements for
    pre-existing noncontrolling interests will be retrospectively
    applied to all prior-period financial information presented.

SFAS No. 141(R) retains the underlying fair value
    concepts of its predecessor (SFAS No. 141), but
    changes the method for applying the acquisition method in a
    number of significant respects including the requirement to
    expense transaction fees and expected restructuring costs as
    incurred, rather than including these amounts in the allocated
    purchase price; the requirement to recognize the fair value of
    contingent consideration at the acquisition date, rather than
    the expected amount when the contingency is resolved; the
    requirement to recognize the fair value of acquired in-process
    research and development assets at the acquisition date, rather
    than immediately expensing; and the requirement to recognize a
    gain in relation to a bargain purchase price, rather than
    reducing the allocated basis of long-lived assets. Because this
    standard is generally applied prospectively, the effect of
    adoption on our financial statements will depend primarily on
    specific transactions, if any, completed after 2008. We are
    currently evaluating the effects that SFAS No. 141(R)
    is likely to have on potential post-2008 transactions.

Under SFAS No. 160, consolidated financial statements
    will be presented as if the parent company investors
    (controlling interests) and other minority investors
    (noncontrolling interests) in partially-owned subsidiaries have
    similar economic interests in a single entity. As a result, the
    investment in the noncontrolling interest, previously recorded
    on the balance sheet between liabilities and equity (the
    “mezzanine”), will be reported as equity in the parent
    company’s consolidated financial statements, subsequent to
    the adoption of SFAS No. 160. Furthermore,
    consolidated financial statements will include 100% of a
    controlled subsidiary’s earnings, rather than only the
    parent company’s share. Lastly, transactions between the
    parent company and noncontrolling interests will be reported in
    equity as transactions between shareholders, provided these
    transactions do not create a change in control. Previously,
    acquisitions of additional interests in a controlled subsidiary
    generally resulted in remeasurement of assets and liabilities
    acquired; dispositions of interests generally resulted in a gain
    or loss.

Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 160 on the Company’s financial
    statements. Presently, there are no significant noncontrolling
    interests in any of the Company’s consolidated
    subsidiaries. Therefore, we currently believe that the impact of
    SFAS No. 160, if any, will primarily depend on the
    materiality of noncontrolling interests arising in future
    transactions, including those entered into during 2008, to which
    the financial statement presentation and disclosure provisions
    of SFAS No. 160 will apply.

Our critical accounting estimates, which require significant
    judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on
    our financial statements, are discussed in the following
    sections on pages 23-27.

Promotional
    expenditures

Our promotional activities are conducted either through the
    retail trade or directly with consumers and involve in-store
    displays and events; feature price discounts on our products;
    consumer coupons, contests, and loyalty programs; and similar
    activities. The costs of these activities are generally
    recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which
    normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition
    of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding
    the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either
    the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using
    various techniques including historical data on performance of
    similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated
    expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and
    recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent
    period. On a full-year basis, these subsequent period
    adjustments have rarely represented more than .4% (.004) of our
    Company’s net sales. However, as our Company’s total
    promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a
    revenue reduction) represented nearly 30% of 2007 net
    sales, the likelihood exists of materially different reported
    results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Intangibles

We follow SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” in evaluating impairment of intangibles.
    We perform this evaluation at least annually during the fourth
    quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting
    process. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment
    testing first



requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value
    of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is
    based on the assets and liabilities associated with the
    operations of that reporting unit, which often requires
    allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units.
    The fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our
    assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a
    theoretical sale transaction. Similarly, impairment testing of
    other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value
    to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of
    non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on
    projections of future cash flows to be generated from that
    asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular
    trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream
    attributable to branded product sales. These estimates are made
    using various inputs including historical data, current and
    anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market
    comparables.

We also follow SFAS No. 142 in evaluating the useful
    life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset is expected to
    contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the
    Company. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is
    amortized; an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is
    not amortized, but is evaluated annually for impairment.
    Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant
    judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of
    obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such
    as the stability of the industry, known technological advances,
    legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing
    regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution
    channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and
    the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

At December 29, 2007, intangible assets, net, were
    $5.0 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and
    trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods
    Company. Within this total, approximately $1.4 billion of
    non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as
    indefinite-lived, comprised principally of Keebler trademarks.
    While we currently believe that the fair value of all of our
    intangibles exceeds carrying value and that those intangibles so
    classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the
    Company, materially different assumptions regarding future
    performance of our North American snacks business or the
    weighted-average cost of capital used in the valuations could
    result in significant impairment losses

and/or

amortization expense.

Stock
    compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R)
    “Share-Based Payment,” which generally requires public
    companies to measure the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
    grant-date fair value and to recognize this cost over the
    requisite service period. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R)
    as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, using the modified
    prospective method. Accordingly, prior years were not restated.
    With the adoption of this pronouncement, stock-based
    compensation represents a critical accounting policy of the
    Company, which is further described in Note 1 within Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2006, our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in
    an increase in the Company’s corporate SGA expense and a
    corresponding reduction to earnings and net earnings per share,
    due primarily to the recognition of compensation expense
    associated with employee and director stock option grants. No
    such expense was recognized under our previous accounting method
    in pre-2006 periods; however we were required to disclose pro
    forma results under the alternative fair value method prescribed
    by SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for

Stock-Based

Compensation”. Using reported results for 2006 and pro
    forma results for 2005, the comparable impact of stock
    compensation expense is presented in the following table:

Accounting for stock compensation under
    SFAS No. 123(R) represents a critical accounting
    estimate, which requires significant judgments and assumptions
    likely to have a material impact on our financial statements.
    Due to the need to determine the grant-date fair value of equity
    instruments that have not yet been awarded, the actual impact on
    future results will depend, in part, on actual awards during any
    reporting period and various market factors that affect the fair
    value of those awards. Additionally, while the timing and volume
    of grants associated with a particular year’s long-term
    incentive compensation are within our control, the timing and
    volume of “reload” option grants are not. Reload
    options are awarded to eligible employees and directors to
    replace previously-owned Company stock used by those individuals
    to pay the exercise price, including related employment taxes,
    of vested pre-2004 option awards containing this accelerated
    ownership feature. Under SFAS No. 123(R), these reload
    options result in additional compensation expense in the year of
    grant and for 2007 and 2006, represented approximately one-third
    of the Company’s total stock option expense.



The Company has not granted options containing an accelerated
    ownership feature since 2003; however, the potential requirement
    to award reload options over the contractual

10-year

term
    of the original grants could continue to significantly impact
    the amount of our stock-based compensation expense for a number
    of years.

We estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the
    date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model for
    annual grants and a Black-Scholes model for reload grants. These
    models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding
    future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and
    dividend yield. Our methods for selecting these valuation
    assumptions are explained in Note 8 within Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. In particular, our estimate
    of stock price volatility is based principally on historical
    volatility of the options granted, and to a lesser extent, on
    implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s
    stock. For the lattice-based model, historical volatility
    corresponds to the

10-year

contractual term of the options granted; whereas, for the
    Black-Scholes model, historical volatility corresponds to the
    expected term, which is currently 2.25 years. We decided to
    rely more heavily on historical volatility due to the greater
    availability of data and reliability of trends over longer
    periods of time, as compared to the terms of more thinly-traded
    options, which rarely extend beyond two years. At year-end 2007,
    historical volatilities using weekly price observations ranged
    from approximately 22% for 10 years to 11% for
    2.25 years, while implied volatilities averaged
    approximately 20% for traded options with terms in excess of six
    months. Based on this data, our weighted-average composite
    volatility assumption for purposes of valuing our option grants
    during 2007 was 17.5%, as compared to 17.9% for 2006. All other
    assumptions held constant, a one percentage point increase or
    decrease in our 2007 volatility assumption would increase or
    decrease the grant-date fair value of our 2007 option awards by
    approximately 4%.

To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions,
    we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based
    expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences
    can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon
    exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two
    paragraphs. Furthermore, as historical data has a significant
    bearing on our forward-looking assumptions, significant
    variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to
    prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then
    significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of
    stock-based compensation expense.

SFAS No. 123(R) also provides that any corporate
    income tax benefit realized upon exercise or ve sting of an
    award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings
    (referred to as a “windfall tax benefit”) will be
    presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as a
    financing (rather than an operating) cash flow. If this standard
    had been adopted in 2005, operating cash flow would have been
    lower (and financing cash flow would have been higher) by
    approximately $20 million as a result of this provision.
    For 2007 and 2006, the corresponding reduction in operating cash
    flow attributable to windfall tax benefits classified as
    financing cash flow was $15 million and $22 million
    respectively. The actual impact on future years’ operating
    cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock
    option exercises during a particular year and the relationship
    between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock
    and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for
    financial reporting purposes.

For balance sheet classification purposes, realized windfall tax
    benefits are credited to capital in excess of par value within
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits
    (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in
    earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of
    windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to
    income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our
    consolidated effective income tax rate. Under the transition
    rules for adopting SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified
    prospective method, we were permitted to calculate a cumulative
    memo balance of windfall tax benefits from post-1995 years
    for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits.
    We completed such study prior to the first period of adoption
    and currently have sufficient cumulative memo windfall tax
    benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that 2008
    earnings are not currently expected to be affected by this
    provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior
    is not within our control, the likelihood exists of materially
    different reported results if different assumptions or
    conditions were to prevail.

Retirement
    benefits

Our Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined
    benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health
    care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada.
    Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations. A
    substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally
    diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings
    of debt securities and other investments. We follow
    SFAS No. 87 “Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions” and SFAS No. 106 “Employers’
    Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions”
    (as amended by SFAS No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans”) for the measurement and recognition of obligations
    and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Embodied in
    both of these standards is the concept that the cost of benefits



provided during retirement should be recognized over the
    employees’ active working life. Inherent in this concept is
    the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict
    and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the
    settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require
    significant management judgment and have a material impact on
    the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and
    accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on
    plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, and the interest
    rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans,
    which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom, and
    Canada.

To conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on
    plan assets, we model expected returns over a

20-year

investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix
    of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect
    a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and
    forward-looking views of the financial markets including
    consideration of current yields on long-term bonds,
    price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and
    long-term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to
    approximately 70% of our trust assets globally, currently
    incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.7% and an
    active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by
    historical analysis. Although we review our expected long-term
    rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment
    performance for one particular year does not, by itself,
    significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of
    return are generally not revised, provided these rates continue
    to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of
    between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected
    long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our
    assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2007 of 8.9%
    equated to approximately the 50th percentile expectation of
    our 2007 model. Similar methods are used for various foreign
    plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic
    conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately
    30% of our global benefit plan assets.

Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at December 29,
    2007, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of
    return would increase 2008 benefits expense by approximately
    $44 million. Correspondingly, a 100 basis point
    shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan
    assets for 2008 would result in a similar amount of arising
    experience loss. Any arising asset-related experience gain or
    loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a
    five-year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses
    are amortized using a declining-balance method over the average
    remaining service period of active plan participants, which for
    U.S. plans is presently about 13 years. Under this
    recognition method, a 100 basis point shortfall in actual
    versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2008
    would reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $1 million
    in 2009, increasing to approximately $7 million in 2013.
    For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan
    assets exceeded/(was less than) the recognized assumed return by
    the following amounts (in millions): 2007–($99);
    2006–$257; 2005–$39.

To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we
    model our actual claims cost data over a five-year historical
    period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age
    groups and other important demographic components of our covered
    retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the
    impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to
    distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health
    care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as
    necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience
    and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. In
    comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost
    growth rate of approximately 6%, our initial trend rate for 2008
    of 8.5% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing
    claims experience for certain demographic groups within our
    total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward
    by 1% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.75% is
    reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as
    necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate
    of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost
    premium. Based on consolidated obligations at December 29,
    2007, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care
    cost trend rates would increase 2008 benefits expense by
    approximately $16 million. A 100 basis point excess of
    2008 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from
    the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience
    loss of approximately $9 million. Any arising health care
    claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the
    calculated amount of claims experience over a four-year period.
    Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using
    a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least
    the minimum amortization prescribed by SFAS No. 106.
    The net experience gain arising from recognition of 2007 claims
    experience was approximately $6 million.

To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we use several
    published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to
    assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities, with a
    primary focus on the

Citigroup Pension Liability
    Index

®

for our U.S. plans. To test the appropriateness of
    these indices, we periodically conduct a matching exercise
    between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and bond
    maturities, consisting principally of AA-rated (or the
    equivalent in foreign jurisdictions) non-callable issues with at
    least $25 million principal outstanding. The model does not
    assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments
    mature just in time to



pay benefits as they become due. For those years where no
    suitable bonds are available, the portfolio utilizes a linear
    interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose
    maturity matches the cash flows required in those years. As of
    three different interim dates during 2007 and four different
    dates during 2006, this matching exercise for our
    U.S. plans produced a discount rate within +/-
    20 basis points of the equivalent-dated

Citigroup
    Pension Liability
    Index

®

.
    The measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are
    consistent with our Company’s fiscal year end. Thus, we
    select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that
    are consistent with market indices during December of each year.
    Based on consolidated obligations at December 29, 2007, a
    25 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount
    rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase
    2008 benefits expense by approximately $15 million. All
    obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized
    using a straight-line method over the average remaining service
    period of active plan participants.

Despite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting
    major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material
    differences between assumed and actual experience. As of
    December 29, 2007, we had consolidated unamortized prior
    service cost and net experience losses of approximately
    $.6 billion, as compared to approximately $.9 billion
    at December 30, 2006. The year-over-year decline in net
    unamortized amounts was attributable primarily to the favorable
    impact of rising discount rates on our benefit obligations. Of
    the total unamortized amounts at December 29, 2007,
    approximately 50% was related to discount rate reductions prior
    to 2007, with the remainder primarily related to net unfavorable
    health care claims cost experience (including upward revisions
    in the assumed trend rate.) For 2008, we currently expect total
    amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to
    be approximately $41 million lower than the actual 2007
    amount of approximately $99 million. As discussed on
    page 14, total employee benefits expense for 2008 is
    expected to be slightly lower than the 2007 amount, due to
    increases in the discount rate environment and the on-going
    phase in of favorable asset returns.

Assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current
    assumptions, annual amortization of accumulated prior service
    cost and net experience losses during each of the next several
    years would decrease versus the 2008 amount.

Income
    taxes

Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax
    planning opportunities available to us in the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is required in
    evaluating our tax positions to determine how much benefit
    should be recognized in our income tax expense. We establish tax
    reserves in accordance with FIN No. 48 (which we
    adopted at the beginning of 2007). FIN No. 48 is based
    on a benefit recognition model, which we believe could result in
    a greater amount of benefit (and a lower amount of reserve)
    being initially recognized in certain circumstances. Prior to
    the adoption of FIN No. 48, our policy was to
    establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known
    tax contingencies. Favorable resolution was recognized as a
    reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
    The initial application of FIN No. 48 resulted in a
    net decrease to the Company’s consolidated accrued income
    tax and related interest liabilities of approximately
    $2 million, with an offsetting increase to retained
    earnings.

The Company evaluates a tax position in two-steps in accordance
    with FIN No. 48. The first step is to determine
    whether it is more-likely-than not that a tax position will be
    sustained upon examination based upon the technical merit of the
    position. In weighing the technical merits of the position, we
    consider the facts and circumstances of the position; we assume
    the reviewing tax authority has full knowledge of the position;
    and we consider the weight of authoritative guidance. The second
    step is measurement; a tax position that meets the
    more-likely-than not recognition threshold is measured to
    determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
    statements. While reviewing the ranges of probable outcomes, the
    Company records the largest amount of benefit that is greater
    than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. The tax position will be derecognized when it is no
    longer more-likely-than not of being sustained.

For the periods presented, our income tax and related interest
    reserves have averaged approximately $170 million. Reserve
    adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1% of
    earnings before income taxes annually. Significant tax reserve
    adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately
    presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 11
    within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The current portion of our tax reserves is presented in the
    balance sheet within accrued income taxes and the amount
    expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other
    noncurrent liabilities. Likewise, the current portion of related
    interest reserves are presented in the balance sheet within
    accrued other liabilities, with the amount expected to be
    settled after one year recorded in other noncurrent liabilities.



FUTURE
    OUTLOOK

Our 2008 forecasted consolidated results are generally based on
    our long-term annual growth targets as discussed on
    page 12, although we currently expect our internal net
    sales could increase at a mid-single digit rate, slightly
    exceeding our low single-digit growth target. We expect this
    higher-than-targeted growth to come principally from previously
    announced pricing initiatives, improved product mix and
    continued innovation. Despite a projected decline in gross
    margin of approximately 100 basis points, which is being
    negatively impacted by 40 basis points due to acquisitions
    and 30 basis points due to up-front costs recorded in cost
    of goods sold, we believe the higher-than-targeted sales growth
    will support mid single-digit consolidated operating profit
    growth. As discussed on page 17, net interest expense for
    2008 is expected to be comparable to 2007 expense, and our
    consolidated effective income tax rate is expected to be
    approximately 31%. Finally, as discussed in more detail on
    page 34, our fiscal year 2008 will benefit from a
    53rd week. The benefit associated with this extra week will
    be largely invested in emerging markets and various acquisitions
    in the United States. These factors are expected to provide the
    growth necessary to achieve our target of high single-digit
    growth in 2008 net earnings per share. In addition, we
    remain committed to reinvesting in brand building,
    cost-reduction initiatives, and other growth opportunities.
    Lastly, we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and
    are currently expecting 2008 cash flow to be approximately even
    with our 2007 results.

Our Company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a
    part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative
    financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to
    manage these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not engage in
    trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 12
    within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information on our accounting policies related to derivative
    financial and commodity instruments.

Foreign
    exchange risk

Our Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash
    flows related to third-party purchases, intercompany loans and
    product shipments. Our Company is also exposed to fluctuations
    in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and
    cash flows related to repatriation of these investments.
    Additionally, our Company is exposed to volatility in the
    translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. Dollars.
    Primary exposures include the U.S. Dollar versus the
    British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, and
    Mexican Peso, and in the case of inter-subsidiary transactions,
    the British Pound versus the Euro. We assess foreign currency
    risk based on transactional cash flows and translational
    volatility and enter into forward contracts, options, and
    currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short
    currency positions. Forward contracts and options are generally
    less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements are
    established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt
    issuances.

The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative
    instruments at year-end 2007 was $570 million, representing
    a settlement obligation of $8.6 million. The total notional
    amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year-end
    2006 was $455 million, representing a settlement obligation
    of $1 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of
    anticipated transactions, translational exposure, or existing
    assets or liabilities, and mature within 18 months.
    Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year-end exchange rates,
    the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately
    $57 million at year-end 2007 and $46 million at
    year-end 2006. These unfavorable changes would generally have
    been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying
    exposures.

Interest
    rate risk

Our Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard
    to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future
    issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposures include
    movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered
    Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. We periodically use
    interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to
    reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated
    with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of
    variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected
    market conditions.

Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    provides information on our significant debt issues. There were
    no interest rate derivatives outstanding at year-end 2007 and
    2006. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the
    year, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would
    have increased interest expense by approximately
    $19 million in 2007 and $20 million in 2006.

Price
    risk

Our Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a
    result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials,
    fuel, and energy. Primary exposures include corn, wheat, soybean
    oil, sugar, cocoa, paperboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We
    have historically used the combination of long-term contracts
    with suppliers, and exchange-traded futures and option contracts
    to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of
    forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally
    less than



18 months. During 2006, we entered into two separate

10-year

over-the-counter commodity swap transactions to reduce
    fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our
    manufacturing processes. The notional amount of the swaps
    totaled $188 million as of December 29, 2007 and
    equates to approximately 50% of our North America manufacturing
    needs. At year-end 2006, the notional amount was
    $209 million.

The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at
    year-end 2007, including the natural gas swaps, was
    $229 million, representing a settlement receivable of
    approximately $22 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in
    year-end commodity prices, the settlement receivable would
    decrease by approximately $22 million, generally offset by
    a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
    The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at
    year-end 2006, including the natural gas swaps, was
    $239 million, representing a settlement obligation of
    approximately $11 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in
    year-end commodity prices, this settlement obligation would
    increase by approximately $17 million, generally offset by
    a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.

In addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed
    above, we use long-term contracts with suppliers to manage a
    portion of the price exposure. It should be noted that the
    exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a
    limitation in assessing the net market risk of our Company.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Basis
    of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Kellogg Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
    Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

The Company’s fiscal year normally ends on the Saturday
    closest to December 31 and as a result, a 53rd week is
    added approximately every sixth year. The Company’s 2007,
    2006 and 2005 fiscal years ended on December 29, December
    30 and December 31, respectively. Our 2008 fiscal year will
    have a 53rd week ending on January 3, 2009.

Cash
    and cash equivalents

Highly liquid temporary investments with original maturities of
    less than three months are considered to be cash equivalents.

Accounts
    receivable

Accounts receivable consist principally of trade receivables,
    which are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowances for
    doubtful accounts and prompt payment discounts. Trade
    receivables generally do not bear interest. Terms and collection
    patterns vary around the world and by channel. In the United
    States, the Company generally has required payment for goods
    sold eleven or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as
    2% 10/net 11 or 1% 15/net 16, and days sales
    outstanding (DSO) has averaged approximately 19 days during
    the periods presented. The allowance for doubtful accounts
    represents management’s estimate of the amount of probable
    credit losses in existing accounts receivable, as determined
    from a review of past due balances and other specific account
    data. Account balances are written off against the allowance
    when management determines the receivable is uncollectible. The
    Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure
    related to its customers. Refer to Note 15 for an analysis
    of the Company’s accounts receivable and allowance for
    doubtful account balances during the periods presented.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.

Property

The Company’s property consists mainly of plant and
    equipment used for manufacturing activities. These assets are
    recorded at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives
    using straight-line methods for financial reporting and
    accelerated methods, where permitted, for tax reporting. Major
    property categories are depreciated over various periods as
    follows (in years): manufacturing machinery and equipment 5-20;
    computer and other office equipment 3-5; building components

15-30;

building structures 50. Cost includes an amount of interest
    associated with significant capital projects. Plant and
    equipment are reviewed for impairment when conditions indicate
    that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions
    include an extended period of idleness or a plan of disposal.
    Assets to be abandoned at a future date are depreciated over the
    remaining period of use. Assets to be sold are written down to
    realizable value at the time the assets are being actively
    marketed for sale and the disposal is expected to occur within
    one year. As of year-end 2006 and 2007, the carrying value of
    assets held for sale was insignificant.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets

The Company’s intangible assets consist primarily of
    goodwill and major trademarks arising from the 2001 acquisition
    of Keebler Foods Company (“Keebler”). Management
    expects the Keebler trademarks, collectively, to contribute
    indefinitely to the cash flows of the Company. Accordingly, this
    asset has been classified as an “indefinite-lived”
    intangible pursuant to SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets.” Under this standard, goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized, but are tested
    at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing
    first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair
    value of a reporting unit, which for the Company is generally
    equivalent to a North American product group or an International
    market. If carrying value exceeds fair value, goodwill is
    considered impaired and is reduced to the implied fair value.
    Impairment testing for

non-amortized

intangibles requires a comparison between the fair value and
    carrying value of the intangible asset. If carrying value
    exceeds fair value, the intangible is considered impaired and is
    reduced to fair value. The Company uses various market valuation
    techniques to determine the fair value of intangible assets.
    Refer to Note 2 for further information on goodwill and
    other intangible assets.

Revenue
    recognition and measurement

The Company recognizes sales upon delivery of its products to
    customers net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns,
    allowances, and various government withholding taxes.
    Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on
    local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range
    from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to
    reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where
    applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a
    combination of historical patterns and future expectations
    regarding specific in-market product performance. The Company
    classifies promotional payments to its customers, the cost of
    consumer coupons, and other cash redemption offers



in net sales. The cost of promotional package inserts are
    recorded in cost of goods sold. Other types of consumer
    promotional expenditures are normally recorded in selling,
    general, and administrative (SGA) expense.

Advertising

The costs of advertising are generally expensed as incurred and
    are classified within SGA expense.

Research
    and development

The costs of research and development (R&D) are generally
    expensed as incurred and are classified within SGA expense.
    R&D includes expenditures for new product and process
    innovation, as well as significant technological improvements to
    existing products and processes. Total annual expenditures for
    R&D are disclosed in Note 15 and are principally
    comprised of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies
    attributable to time spent on R&D activities. Other costs
    include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and
    equipment, including assets at manufacturing locations that are
    temporarily engaged in pilot plant activities.

Stock
    compensation

The Company uses various equity-based compensation programs to
    provide long-term performance incentives for its global
    workforce. Refer to Note 8 for further information on these
    programs and the amount of compensation expense recognized
    during the periods presented.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R)
    “Share-Based Payment,” which generally requires public
    companies to measure the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
    grant-date fair value and to recognize this cost over the
    requisite service period. The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R) as of the beginning of its 2006 fiscal
    year, using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior
    years were not restated, but 2006 results include compensation
    expense associated with unvested equity-based awards, which were
    granted prior to 2006.

Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company used
    the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles
    Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees” to account for its employee stock
    options and other stock-based compensation. Under this method,
    because the exercise price of stock options granted to employees
    and directors equaled the market price of the underlying stock
    on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was
    recognized. Expense attributable to other types of stock-based
    awards was generally recognized in the Company’s reported
    results under APB No. 25.

Certain of the Company’s equity-based compensation plans
    contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon
    retirement, disability, or death of eligible employees and
    directors. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    Company generally recognized stock compensation expense over the
    stated vesting period of the award, with any unamortized expense
    recognized immediately if an acceleration event occurred.
    SFAS No. 123(R) specifies that a stock-based award is
    considered vested for expense attribution purposes when the
    employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent
    on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, beginning in 2006,
    the Company has prospectively revised its expense attribution
    method so that the related compensation cost is recognized
    immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible
    individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date
    retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated
    vesting period.

The Company classifies pre-tax stock compensation expense
    principally in SGA expense within its corporate operations.
    Expense attributable to awards of equity instruments is accrued
    in capital in excess of par value within the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

SFAS No. 123(R) also provides that any corporate
    income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award
    in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to
    as a “windfall tax benefit”) will be presented in the
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as a financing (rather than
    an operating) cash flow. Realized windfall tax benefits are
    credited to capital in excess of par value in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which
    are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first
    offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits,
    if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense. Under
    the transition rules for adopting SFAS No. 123(R)
    using the modified prospective method, the Company was permitted
    to calculate a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits
    from post-1995 years for the purpose of accounting for
    future shortfall tax benefits. The Company completed such study
    prior to the first period of adoption and currently has
    sufficient cumulative memo windfall tax benefits to absorb
    arising shortfalls, such that earnings were not affected in
    2007. Correspondingly, the Company includes the impact of pro
    forma deferred tax assets (i.e., the “as if” windfall
    or shortfall) for purposes of determining assumed proceeds in
    the treasury stock calculation of diluted earnings per share
    under SFAS No. 128 “Earnings Per Share.”

Employee
    postretirement and postemployment benefits

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign plans to
    provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to
    retired employees, as well as salary continuance, severance, and
    long-term disability to former or inactive employees. Refer to
    Notes 9 and 10



for further information on these benefits and the amount of
    expense recognized during the periods presented.

In order to improve the reporting of pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans in the financial statements, in
    September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans,” which was effective for the
    Company at the end of its 2006 fiscal year. Prior periods were
    not restated. The standard generally requires company plan
    sponsors to measure the net over- or

under-funded

position of a defined postretirement benefit plan as of the
    sponsor’s fiscal year end and to display that position as
    an asset or liability on the balance sheet. Any unrecognized
    prior service cost, experience gains/losses, or transition
    obligation are reported as a component of other comprehensive
    income, net of tax, in shareholders’ equity. In contrast,
    under

pre-existing

guidance, these unrecognized amounts were generally disclosed
    only in financial statement footnotes, often resulting in a
    disparity between plan balance sheet positions and the funded
    status. Furthermore, plan measurement dates could occur up to
    three months prior to year end.

Uncertain
    tax positions

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN No. 48) to clarify what criteria must be met
    prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit, in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes,” of a position taken in a tax return. The provisions
    of the final interpretation apply broadly to all tax positions
    taken by an enterprise, including the decision not to report
    income in a tax return or the decision to classify a transaction
    as tax exempt. The prescribed approach is based on a

two-step

benefit recognition model. The first step is to evaluate the tax
    position for recognition by determining if the weight of
    available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based
    on the technical merits and without consideration of detection
    risk, that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the
    benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is
    measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater
    than 50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon
    settlement. The tax position must be derecognized when it is no
    longer more likely than not of being sustained. The
    interpretation also provides guidance on recognition and
    classification of related penalties and interest, classification
    of liabilities, and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits.
    The change in net assets, if any, as a result of applying the
    provisions of this interpretation is considered a change in
    accounting principle with the cumulative effect of the change
    treated as an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of
    retained earnings in the period of transition.

The Company adopted FIN No. 48 as of the beginning of
    its 2007 fiscal year. Prior to adoption, the Company’s

pre-existing

policy was to establish reserves for uncertain tax positions
    that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.
    As compared to the Company’s historical approach, the
    application of FIN No. 48 resulted in a net decrease
    to accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of
    approximately $2 million, with an offsetting increase to
    retained earnings.

Interest recognized in accordance with FIN No. 48 may
    be classified in the financial statements as either income taxes
    or interest expense, based on the accounting policy election of
    the enterprise. Similarly, penalties may be classified as income
    taxes or another expense. The Company has historically
    classified income

tax-related

interest and penalties as interest expense and SGA expense,
    respectively, and continues to do so under FIN No. 48.

Recently
    issued pronouncements

Fair value.

In
    September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements” in order to establish a
    single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring
    fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
    that is intended to result in increased consistency and
    comparability in fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157
    also expands disclosures about fair value measurements, with the
    intention of improving the quality of information provided to
    users of financial statements. The standard applies whenever
    other authoritative literature requires (or permits) certain
    assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, but does not
    expand the use of fair value. SFAS No. 157 was
    originally effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those years with early adoption permitted. In
    early 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP)

FAS-157-2,

which delays by one year, the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for all

non-financial

assets and

non-financial

liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at
    fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at
    least annually). The delay pertains to items including, but not
    limited to,

non-financial

assets and

non-financial

liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business
    combination, reporting units measured at fair value in the first
    step of evaluating goodwill for impairment under
    SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets”,

indefinite-lived

intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment
    assessment under SFAS No. 142, and

long-lived

assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment under
    SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of

Long-Lived

Assets”. The Company plans to adopt the portion of
    SFAS No. 157 that has not been delayed by FSP

FAS-157-2

as
    of the beginning of its



2008 fiscal year, and plans to adopt the balance of its
    provisions as of the beginning of its 2009 fiscal year. For the
    Company, balance sheet items carried at fair value on a
    recurring basis (to which SFAS No. 157 applies in
    2008) consist primarily of derivative financial instruments
    which are valued primarily based on quoted prices in active or
    brokered markets for identical as well as similar assets and
    liabilities. Balance sheet items carried at fair value on a

non-recurring

basis (to which SFAS No. 157 will apply in
    2009) consist of assets held for sale and exit liabilities.
    Relevant to the “

Intangibles

” section beginning
    on page 23, the Company also uses fair value concepts to
    test various

long-lived

assets for impairment and to initially measure assets and
    liabilities acquired in a business combination. Management does
    not currently expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 in
    2008 to have a material effect on the measurement of the
    Company’s financial assets and liabilities. The Company is
    continuing to evaluate the impact the standard will have on the
    determination of fair value related to

non-financial

assets and

non-financial

liabilities in

post-2008 years.

Business combinations and
    noncontrolling interests.

In December 2007, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007) “Business
    Combinations” and SFAS No. 160 “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements,” which are
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. These new standards represent the completion of the
    FASB’s first major joint project with the International
    Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and are intended to improve,
    simplify, and converge internationally the accounting for
    business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling
    interests (formerly minority interests) in consolidated
    financial statements. Kellogg Company will adopt these standards
    at the beginning of its 2009 fiscal year. The effect of adoption
    will generally be prospectively applied to transactions
    completed after the end of the Company’s 2008 fiscal year,
    although the new presentation and disclosure requirements for

pre-existing

noncontrolling interests will be retrospectively applied to all

prior-period

financial information presented.

SFAS No. 141(R) retains the underlying fair value
    concepts of its predecessor (SFAS No. 141), but
    changes the method for applying the acquisition method in a
    number of significant respects including the requirement to
    expense transaction fees and expected restructuring costs as
    incurred, rather than including these amounts in the allocated
    purchase price; the requirement to recognize the fair value of
    contingent consideration at the acquisition date, rather than
    the expected amount when the contingency is resolved; the
    requirement to recognize the fair value of acquired

in-process

research and development assets at the acquisition date, rather
    than immediately expensing; and the requirement to recognize a
    gain in relation to a bargain purchase price, rather than
    reducing the allocated basis of

long-lived

assets. Because this standard is generally applied
    prospectively, the effect of adoption on the Company’s
    financial statements will depend primarily on specific
    transactions, if any, completed after 2008. Management is
    currently evaluating the effects that SFAS No. 141(R)
    is likely to have on potential

post-2008

transactions.

Under SFAS No. 160, consolidated financial statements
    will be presented as if the parent company investors
    (controlling interests) and other minority investors
    (noncontrolling interests) in

partially-owned

subsidiaries have similar economic interests in a single entity.
    As a result, the investment in the noncontrolling interest,
    previously recorded on the balance sheet between liabilities and
    equity (the “mezzanine”), will be reported as equity
    in the parent company’s consolidated financial statements,
    subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 160.
    Furthermore, consolidated financial statements will include 100%
    of a controlled subsidiary’s earnings, rather than only the
    parent company’s share. Lastly, transactions between the
    parent company and noncontrolling interests will be reported in
    equity as transactions between shareholders, provided that these
    transactions do not create a change in control. Previously,
    acquisitions of additional interests in a controlled subsidiary
    generally resulted in remeasurement of assets and liabilities
    acquired; dispositions of interests generally resulted in a gain
    or loss.

Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 160 on the Company’s financial
    statements. Presently, there are no significant

non-controlling

interests in any of the Company’s consolidated
    subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company currently believes that the
    impact of SFAS No. 160, if any, will primarily depend
    on the materiality of noncontrolling interests arising in future
    transactions, including those entered into during 2008, to which
    the financial statement presentation and disclosure provisions
    of SFAS No. 160 will apply.

Use
    of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE 2

ACQUISITIONS,
    OTHER INVESTMENTS, AND INTANGIBLES

Acquisitions

In order to support the continued growth of its North America
    operating segment, the Company completed



two separate business acquisitions in late 2007 for a total of
    approximately $123 million in cash, including related
    transaction costs. On November 1, 2007, a subsidiary of the
    Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in Bear Naked,
    Inc., a leading seller of

premium-branded

natural granola products. On November 5, 2007, the Company
    acquired certain assets and liabilities of the
    Wholesome & Hearty Foods Company, a
    U.S. manufacturer of veggie foods marketed under the
    Gardenburger

®

brand. Assets, liabilities, and results of the acquired
    businesses have been included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements since the respective dates of acquisition;
    such results were insignificant for the Company’s fourth
    quarter of 2007. Similarly, management has estimated that the
    pro forma effect on the Company’s results of operations, as
    though these business combinations had been completed at the
    beginning of either 2007 or 2006, would have been immaterial. As
    of December 29, 2007, the purchase price allocation was
    substantially complete with the combined total allocated as
    follows (in millions):

goodwill–$67;

indefinite-lived

trademark

intangibles–$33;

trademark intangibles with a

10-year

expected useful

life–$5;

equipment–$7;

working capital and other individually immaterial

items-$11.

The amount of

tax-deductible

goodwill is currently expected to approximate the carrying value
    recognized for financial reporting purposes.

Subsequent
    events

To expand the Company’s presence in Eastern Europe, on
    January 16, 2008, subsidiaries of the Company acquired
    substantially all of the equity interests in OJSC Kreker (doing
    business as “United Bakers”) and consolidated
    subsidiaries for approximately $117 million in cash,
    including transaction fees incurred to date, and $3 million
    in assumed debt. The Company expects to acquire the remaining
    minority interests through tender offers initiated during 2008.
    United Bakers is a leading producer of cereal, cookie, and
    cracker products in Russia, with 4,000 employees, six
    manufacturing facilities, and a broad distribution network. The
    business earned approximately $100 million of revenues in
    2007. (Due to various factors including accounting principle
    conformity, these revenues are not necessarily indicative of the
    pro forma incremental effect on the Company’s 2007
    consolidated net sales, assuming this business combination had
    been completed at the beginning of 2007.)

The purchase agreement between the Company and the seller
    provides for the payment of a currently undeterminable amount of
    contingent consideration at the end of three years, provided
    certain financial performance metrics are achieved. Such payment
    would be recognized as additional purchase price when the
    contingency is resolved.

As part of the aforementioned initial purchase price for this
    acquisition, the Company incurred approximately $5 million
    in transaction fees and cash advances during 2007, which have
    been classified as business

acquisition-related

investing cash outflows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
    Flows for the year ended December 29, 2007.

Joint
    venture arrangement

In early 2006, a subsidiary of the Company formed a joint
    venture with a

third-party

company domiciled in Turkey, for the purpose of selling

co-branded

products in the surrounding region. During 2007, the Company
    contributed approximately $4 million in cash to its Turkish
    joint venture, in which it owns a 50% equity interest, bringing
    the total cumulative investment to approximately
    $7 million. The Turkish joint venture is reflected in the
    consolidated financial statements on the equity basis of
    accounting. Accordingly, the Company records its share of the
    earnings or loss from this arrangement as well as other direct
    transactions with or on behalf of the joint venture entity such
    as product sales and certain administrative expenses.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets

For 2007, the Company recorded in selling, general, and
    administrative expense impairment losses of $7 million to
    write off the remaining carrying value of several individually
    insignificant trademarks, which were abandoned during the year.
    As presented in the following table, associated gross carrying
    amounts of $16 million and the related accumulated
    amortization were retired from the Company’s balance sheet.

For the periods presented, the Company’s intangible assets

NOTE 3

EXIT OR
    DISPOSAL PLANS

The Company views its continued spending on

cost-reduction

initiatives as part of its ongoing operating principles to
    provide greater reliability in meeting

long-term

growth targets. Initiatives undertaken must meet certain

pay-back

and
    internal rate of return (IRR) targets. Each

cost-reduction

initiative is normally one to three years in duration. Upon
    completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of

multi-year

programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings

and/or

reduced depreciation, which is then used to fund new
    initiatives. To implement these programs, the Company has
    incurred various

up-front

costs, including asset

write-offs,

exit charges, and other project expenditures.

Cost
    summary

For 2007, the Company recorded total

program-related

charges of approximately $100 million, comprised of
    $7 million of asset

write-offs,

$72 million for severance and other exit costs including
    route franchise settlements, discussed on page 40,
    $15 million for other cash expenditures, and
    $6 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal
    liability. Approximately $23 million of the total 2007
    charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within the Europe
    operating segment results, with approximately $77 million
    recorded in SGA expense within the North America operating
    results.

For 2006, the Company recorded total

program-related

charges of approximately $82 million, comprised of
    $20 million of asset

write-offs,

$30 million for severance and other exit costs,
    $9 million for other cash expenditures, $4 million for
    a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability, and
    $19 million for pension and other postretirement plan
    curtailment losses and special termination benefits.
    Approximately $74 million of the total 2006 charges were
    recorded in cost of goods sold within operating segment results,
    with approximately $8 million recorded in SGA expense
    within corporate results. The Company’s operating segments
    were impacted as follows (in millions): North

America–$46;

Europe–$28.

For 2005, the Company recorded total

program-related

charges of approximately $90 million, comprised of
    $16 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal
    liability, $44 million of asset

write-offs,

$21 million for severance and other exit costs, and
    $9 million for other cash expenditures. All of the 2005
    charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within the
    Company’s North America operating segment.

Exit cost reserves were approximately $5 million at
    December 29, 2007, consisting principally of severance and
    lease termination obligations associated with projects commenced
    in 2007, which are expected to be paid out in 2008. At
    December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, exit cost
    reserves were approximately $14 million, and
    $13 million respectively, primarily representing severance
    costs that were substantially paid out in the following year.

Specific
    initiatives

In September 2006, the Company approved a

multi-year

European manufacturing optimization plan to improve utilization
    of its facility in Manchester, England and to better align
    production in Europe. Based on forecasted foreign exchange
    rates, the Company currently expects to incur approximately
    $55 million in total

up-front

costs, including $28 million recorded in 2006, and
    $19 million recorded in 2007, with the remainder to be
    incurred in 2008. The cost is comprised of approximately 90%
    cash expenditures and 10%

non-cash

asset

write-offs.

The cash portion of the total

up-front

costs results principally from management’s plan to
    eliminate approximately 220 hourly and salaried positions
    from the Manchester facility by the end of 2008 through
    voluntary early retirement and severance programs. The pension
    trust funding requirements of these early retirements are
    expected to exceed the recognized benefit expense impact by
    approximately $5 million; most of this incremental funding
    occurred in 2006. During this program, certain manufacturing
    equipment will also be removed from service.

All of the costs for the European manufacturing optimization
    plan have been recorded in cost of goods sold within the
    Company’s European operating segment. The following tables
    present total project costs to date and a reconciliation of
    employee severance reserves for this initiative. All other cash
    costs were paid in the period incurred.

In October 2007, management committed to reorganize certain
    production processes between the Company’s plants in Valls,
    Spain and Bremen, Germany. Commencement of this plan follows
    consultation with union representatives at the Bremen facility
    regarding the elimination of approximately 120 employee
    positions. This reorganization plan is specifically intended to
    improve manufacturing and distribution efficiency across the
    Company’s continental European operations, and is expected
    to be completed by mid 2008. Based on forecasted foreign
    exchange rates, the Company expects to incur approximately
    $25 million of total project costs, comprised of
    approximately 50% asset

write-offs

and 50% employee separation benefits and other cash costs. The
    Company recorded $4 million of costs in 2007, with the
    remaining to be incurred in 2008.

All of the costs for European production process realignment
    have been recorded in cost of goods sold within the
    Company’s European operating segment.

The following tables present total project costs to date and a

In July 2007, management commenced a plan to reorganize the
    Company’s direct

store-door

delivery (DSD) operations in the southeastern United States.
    This DSD reorganization plan is intended to integrate the
    Company’s southeastern sales and distribution regions with
    the rest of its U.S. direct

store-door

operations, resulting in greater efficiency across the
    nationwide network. In preparation for this initiative, in June
    2007, the Company began to extend offers to exit approximately
    517 distribution route franchise agreements with independent
    contractors, which were substantially accepted as of July 2007.
    The plan resulted in the involuntary termination or relocation
    of approximately 300 employee positions. Total project
    costs incurred were $77 million, principally consisting of
    cash expenditures for route franchise settlements and to a
    lesser extent, for employee separation, relocation, and
    reorganization. This initiative was substantially complete by
    the end of 2007.

All of the costs for the U.S. DSD reorganization plan have
    been recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense
    within the Company’s North America operating segment. The
    following tables present total project costs to date. Exit cost
    reserves were approximately $3 million as of
    December 29, 2007, primarily related to lease termination
    costs. All other cash costs were paid in the period incurred.

    plan withdrawal liability.

During 2006, the Company commenced several initiatives to
    enhance the productivity and efficiency of its U.S. cereal
    manufacturing network, primarily through technological and
    sourcing improvements in warehousing and packaging operations.
    In conjunction with these initiatives, the Company offered
    voluntary separation incentives, which resulted in the
    retirement of approximately 80 hourly employees by early
    2007. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company incurred
    approximately $15 million of total

up-front

costs, comprised of approximately 20% asset

write-offs

and 80% cash costs, including $10 million of pension and
    other postretirement plan curtailment losses. These initiatives
    were complete by the end of 2007.

Also during 2006, the Company undertook an initiative to improve
    customer focus and selling efficiency within a particular Latin
    American market, leading to a shift from a

third-party

distributor to a direct sales force model. As a result of this
    initiative, the Company paid $8 million in cash during the
    fourth



quarter of 2006 to exit the existing distribution arrangement.

To improve operational efficiency and better position its North
    American snacks business for future growth, during 2005, the
    Company undertook an initiative to consolidate U.S. bakery
    capacity, which was completed by the end of 2006. The project
    resulted in the closure and sale of the Company’s Des
    Plaines, Illinois facility in late 2005 and closure of its
    Macon, Georgia facility in April 2006, with sale occurring in
    September 2006. These closures resulted in the elimination of
    over 700 hourly and salaried employee positions, through
    the combination of involuntary severance and attrition. Related
    to this initiative, the Company incurred

up-front

costs of approximately $80 million in 2005, comprised of
    approximately

one-half

asset

write-offs

and

one-half

cash costs, including $16 million for the present value of
    a projected multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability
    associated with closure of the Macon facility. The Company
    incurred approximately $31 million in

up-front

costs for 2006, comprised of approximately

one-third

asset

write-offs

and

two-thirds

cash costs, including a $4 million increase in the
    Company’s estimated pension plan withdrawal liability to
    $20 million. This increase was principally attributable to
    investment loss experienced during 2005 in conjunction with
    increased benefit levels for all participating employers. The
    final calculation of this liability is pending

full-year

2007 employee hours attributable to the Company’s
    remaining participation in this plan, and is therefore subject
    to adjustment in early 2008. The associated cash obligation is
    payable to the pension fund over a

20-year

maximum period; management has not currently determined the
    actual period over which the payments will be made. Except for
    this pension plan withdrawal liability, the Company’s cash
    obligations attributable to this initiative were substantially
    paid out by year end 2006.

NOTE 4

OTHER
    INCOME (EXPENSE), NET

Other income (expense), net includes

non-operating

items such as interest income, charitable donations, and gains
    and losses from foreign currency and commodity derivatives.

Other expense includes charges for contributions to the
    Kellogg’s Corporate Citizenship Fund, a private trust
    established for charitable giving, as follows (in millions):
    2007–$12; 2006–$3; 2005–$16. Other expense for
    2005 also includes a charge of approximately $7 million to
    reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to
    estimated selling value. This facility was sold in August 2006.

NOTE 5

EQUITY

During the year ended December 30, 2006, the Company
    revised the classification of $101 million of prior net
    losses realized upon reissuance of treasury shares from capital
    in excess of par value to retained earnings on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. Such reissuances occurred in connection with
    employee and director stock option exercises and other

share-based

settlements. The revision did not have an effect on the
    Company’s results of operations, total shareholders’
    equity, or cash flows.

Earnings
    per share

Basic net earnings per share is determined by dividing net
    earnings by the

weighted-average

number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
    net earnings per share is similarly determined, except that the
    denominator is increased to include the number of additional
    common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive
    potential common shares had been issued. Dilutive potential
    common shares are comprised principally of employee stock
    options issued by the Company. Basic net earnings per share is
    reconciled to diluted net earnings per share in the following
    table. The total number of

anti-dilutive

potential common shares excluded from the reconciliation for
    each period was (in millions):

2007–.8;

2006–.7;

2005–1.5.

Stock
    transactions

The Company issues shares to employees and directors under
    various

equity-based

compensation and stock purchase programs, as further discussed
    in Note 8. The number of shares issued during the periods
    presented was (in millions):

2007–4;

2006–7;

2005–8.

Additionally, during 2006, the Company established

Kellogg
    Direct

tm

,
    a direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan for
    U.S. shareholders. The total number of shares issued for
    that purpose was less than one million in both 2007 and 2006.



To offset these issuances and for general corporate purposes,
    the Company’s Board of Directors has authorized management
    to repurchase specified amounts of the Company’s common
    stock in each of the periods presented. In 2007, the Company
    spent $650 million to repurchase approximately
    12 million shares. In 2006, the Company spent
    $650 million to repurchase approximately 15 million
    shares. This activity consisted principally of a February 2006
    private transaction with the W. K. Kellogg Foundation Trust to
    repurchase approximately 13 million shares for
    $550 million. In 2005, the Company spent $664 million
    to repurchase approximately 16 million shares. This
    activity consisted principally of a November 2005 private
    transaction with the W. K. Kellogg Foundation Trust to
    repurchase approximately 9 million shares for
    $400 million.

On October 26, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $650 million
    for 2008.

Comprehensive
    income

Comprehensive income includes net earnings and all other changes
    in equity during a period except those resulting from
    investments by or distributions to shareholders. Other
    comprehensive income for the periods presented consists of
    foreign currency translation adjustments pursuant to
    SFAS No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation,”
    unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges pursuant to
    SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Additionally, other
    comprehensive income for 2007 includes adjustments for net
    experience losses and prior service cost pursuant to
    SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.”
    The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of the end of its
    2006 fiscal year. Refer to Note 1 for further information.
    Comprehensive income for prior years included minimum pension
    liability adjustments pursuant to SFAS No. 87
    “Employers Accounting for Pensions.”

NOTE 6

LEASES
    AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

The Company’s leases are generally for equipment and
    warehouse space. Rent expense on all operating leases was (in
    millions):

2007–$135;

2006–$123;

2005–$115.

Additionally, the Company was subject to a residual value
    guarantee on one operating lease of approximately
    $13 million, which was scheduled to expire in July 2007.
    During the first quarter of 2007, the Company recognized a
    liability in connection with this guarantee of approximately
    $5 million, which was recorded in cost of goods sold within
    the Company’s North America operating segment. During the
    second quarter of 2007, the Company terminated the lease
    agreement and purchased the facility for approximately
    $16 million, which discharged the residual value guarantee
    obligation. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company entered into
    approximately $5 million, $2 million and
    $3 million, respectively, in capital lease agreements to
    finance the purchase of equipment.

At December 29, 2007, future minimum annual lease
    commitments under noncancelable operating and capital leases
    were as follows:

One of the Company’s subsidiaries was guarantor on loans to
    independent contractors for the purchase of DSD route
    franchises. In July 2007, we exited these agreements. Refer to
    Note 3 for further information.

The Company has provided various standard indemnifications in
    agreements to sell and purchase business assets and lease
    facilities over the past several years, related primarily to

pre-existing

tax, environmental, and employee benefit obligations. Certain of
    these indemnifications are limited by agreement in either amount

and/or

term
    and others are unlimited. The Company has also provided various
    “hold harmless” provisions within certain service type
    agreements. Because the Company is not currently aware of any
    actual exposures associated with these indemnifications,
    management is unable to estimate the maximum potential future
    payments to be made. At December 29, 2007, the Company had
    not recorded any liability related to these indemnifications.

NOTE 7

transactions. The Euro Notes were redeemable in whole or in part
    at par on interest payment dates or upon the occurrence of
    certain events in 2006 and 2007. In accordance with these terms,
    on January 31, 2007, the Borrower announced that it had
    exercised its right to call for early redemption all of the
    outstanding Euro Notes effective February 28, 2007, at a
    redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and
    unpaid interest through the redemption date.

(d)

In December 2007, the Company
    issued $750 million of

five-year

5.125% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using the proceeds from
    these Notes to replace a portion of its U.S. commercial paper.
    These Notes were issued under an existing shelf registration
    statement. The effective interest rate on these Notes,
    reflecting issuance discount and swap settlement, is 5.12%. The
    Notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the
    Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur
    certain liens or enter into certain sale and

lease-back

transactions. The customary covenants also contain a change of
    control provision.

As discussed in preceding subnote (c), on January 31, 2007,
    a subsidiary of the Company announced an early redemption,
    effective February 28, 2007, of Euro 550 million
    of Guaranteed Floating Rate Notes otherwise due May 2007. To
    partially refinance this redemption, the Company and two of its
    subsidiaries (the “Issuers”) established a program
    under which the Issuers may issue

euro-commercial

paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any
    time of $750 million or its equivalent in alternative
    currencies. The notes may have maturities ranging up to
    364 days and will be senior unsecured obligations of the
    applicable Issuer. Notes issued by subsidiary Issuers will be
    guaranteed by the Company. The notes may be issued at a discount
    or may bear fixed or floating rate interest or a coupon
    calculated by reference to an index or formula. As of
    December 29, 2007 no notes were issued under this program.

At December 29, 2007, the Company had $2.6 billion of

short-term

lines of credit, virtually all of which were unused and
    available for borrowing on an unsecured basis. These lines were
    comprised principally of an unsecured

Five-Year

Credit Agreement, which the Company entered into during November
    2006 to replace an existing facility, which would have expired
    in 2009. The agreement allows the Company to borrow, on a
    revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion, to obtain
    letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to $75 million,
    and to provide a procedure for lenders to bid on

short-term

debt of the Company. The agreement contains customary covenants
    and warranties, including specified restrictions on
    indebtedness, liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and a
    specified interest coverage ratio. If an event of default
    occurs, then, to the extent permitted, the administrative agent
    may terminate the commitments under the credit facility,
    accelerate any outstanding loans, and demand the deposit of cash
    collateral equal to the lender’s letter of credit exposure
    plus interest. The Company entered into a $400 million
    unsecured

364-Day

Credit Agreement effective January 31, 2007, and a
    $700 million

364-Day

Credit Agreement effective June 13, 2007, both containing
    customary covenants, warranties, and restrictions similar to
    those described herein for the

Five-Year

Credit Agreement. The facilities are available for general
    corporate purposes, including commercial paper

back-up,

although the Company does not currently anticipate any usage
    under the facilities. On December 3, 2007, the Company
    terminated the $700 million Credit Agreement. The
    $400 million Credit Agreement expired at the end of January
    2008 and the Company did not renew it.

NOTE 8

STOCK
    COMPENSATION

The Company uses various

equity-based

compensation programs to provide

long-term

performance incentives for its global workforce. Currently,
    these incentives consist principally of stock options, and to a
    lesser extent, executive performance shares and restricted stock
    grants. The Company also sponsors a discounted stock purchase
    plan in the United States and

matching-grant

programs in several international locations. Additionally, the
    Company awards stock options and restricted stock to its outside
    directors. These awards are administered through several plans,
    as described within this Note.

The 2003

Long-Term

Incentive Plan (“2003 Plan”), approved by shareholders
    in 2003, permits benefits to be awarded to employees and
    officers in the form of incentive and

non-qualified

stock options, performance units, restricted stock or restricted
    stock units, and stock appreciation rights. The 2003 Plan
    authorizes the issuance of a total of (a) 25 million
    shares plus (b) shares not issued under the 2001

Long-Term

Incentive Plan, with no more than 5 million shares to be
    issued in satisfaction of performance units,

performance-based

restricted shares and other awards (excluding stock options and
    stock appreciation rights), and with additional annual
    limitations on awards or payments to individual participants. At
    December 29, 2007, there were 10.7 million remaining
    authorized, but unissued, shares under the 2003 Plan. During the
    periods presented, specific awards and terms of those awards
    granted under the 2003 Plan are described in the following
    sections of this Note.

The

Non-Employee

Director Stock Plan (“Director Plan”) was approved by
    shareholders in 2000 and allows each eligible

non-employee

director to receive 2,100 shares of the Company’s
    common stock annually and annual grants of options to purchase
    5,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. At
    December 29, 2007, there were .4 million remaining
    authorized, but unissued, shares under this plan. Shares other
    than



options are placed in the Kellogg Company Grantor Trust for

Non-Employee

Directors (the “Grantor Trust”). Under the terms of
    the Grantor Trust, shares are available to a director only upon
    termination of service on the Board. Under this plan, awards
    were as follows:

2007–51,791

options and 21,702 shares;

2006–50,000

options and 17,000 shares;

2005–55,000

options and 17,000 shares. Options granted to directors
    under this plan are included in the option activity tables
    within this Note.

The 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was approved by
    shareholders in 2002 and permits eligible employees to purchase
    Company stock at a discounted price. This plan allows for a
    maximum of 2.5 million shares of Company stock to be issued
    at a purchase price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair
    market value of the stock on the first or last day of the
    quarterly purchase period. Total purchases through this plan for
    any employee are limited to a fair market value of $25,000
    during any calendar year. The Plan was amended in 2007 and
    beginning in 2008, Company stock will be issued at a purchase
    price equal to 95% of the fair market value of the stock on the
    last day of the quarterly purchase period. At December 29,
    2007, there were 1.2 million remaining authorized, but
    unissued, shares under this plan. Shares were purchased by
    employees under this plan as follows (approximate number of
    shares):

2007–232,000;

2006–237,000;

2005–218,000.

Options granted to employees to purchase discounted stock under
    this plan are included in the option activity tables within this
    Note.

Additionally, during 2002, a foreign subsidiary of the Company
    established a stock purchase plan for its employees. Subject to
    limitations, employee contributions to this plan are matched 1:1
    by the Company. Under this plan, shares were granted by the
    Company to match an approximately equal number of shares
    purchased by employees as follows (approximate number of
    shares):

2007–75,000;

2006–80,000;

2005–80,000.

The Executive Stock Purchase Plan was established in 2002 to
    encourage and enable certain eligible employees of the Company
    to acquire Company stock, and to align more closely the
    interests of those individuals and the Company’s
    shareholders. This plan allows for a maximum of
    500,000 shares of Company stock to be issued. At
    December 29, 2007, there were approximately 460,000
    remaining authorized, but unissued, shares under this plan.
    Under this plan, shares were granted by the Company to
    executives in lieu of cash bonuses as follows (approximate
    number of shares):

2007–0;

2006–4,000;

2005–2,000.

The Company used the fair value method prescribed by
    SFAS No. 123(R)

“Share-Based

Payment” to account for its

equity-based

compensation programs. Prior to 2006, the Company used the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion (APB) No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees.” Refer to Note 1 for further information on
    the Company’s accounting policy for stock compensation.

For the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30,
    2006, compensation expense for all types of

equity-based

programs and the related income tax benefit recognized were as
    follows:

(millions)

As of December 29, 2007, total

stock-based

compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized
    was approximately $33 million and the

weighted-average

period over which this amount is expected to be recognized was
    approximately 1.3 years.

Cash flows realized upon exercise or vesting of

stock-based

awards in the periods presented are included in the following
    table. Tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting of

stock-based

awards generally represent the tax benefit of the difference
    between the exercise price and strike price of the option.
    Within this amount, the 2007 and 2006 windfall tax benefit
    (amount realized in excess of that previously recognized in
    earnings) of $15 million and $22 million, respectively
    represents the operating cash flow reduction (and financing cash
    flow increase) related to the Company’s adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006. Refer to Note 1 for
    further information on the Company’s accounting policies
    regarding tax benefit windfalls and shortfalls.

Cash used by the Company to settle equity instruments granted
    under

stock-based

awards was insignificant.

Shares used to satisfy

stock-based

awards are normally issued out of treasury stock, although
    management is authorized to issue new shares to the extent
    permitted by respective plan provisions. Refer to Note 5
    for information on shares issued during the periods presented to
    employees and directors under various

long-term

incentive plans and share repurchases under the Company’s
    stock repurchase authorizations. The Company does not currently
    have a policy of repurchasing a specified number of shares
    issued under employee benefit programs during any particular
    time period.

Stock
    options

During the periods presented,

non-qualified

stock options were granted to eligible employees under the 2003
    Plan with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the
    Company’s stock on the grant date, a contractual term of
    ten years, and a

two-year

graded vesting period. Grants to outside directors under the

Non-Employee

Director Stock Plan included similar terms, but vested
    immediately. Additionally, “reload” options were
    awarded to eligible employees and directors to replace

previously-owned

Company stock used by those individuals to pay the exercise
    price, including related employment taxes, of vested

pre-2004

option awards containing this accelerated ownership feature.
    These reload options are immediately vested, with an expiration
    date which is the same as the original option grant.

Management estimates the fair value of each annual stock option
    award on the date of grant using a

lattice-based

option valuation model. Due to the

already-vested

status and short expected term of reload options, management
    uses a

Black-Scholes

model to value such awards. Composite assumptions, which are not
    materially different for each of the two models, are presented
    in the following table.

Weighted-average

values are disclosed for certain inputs which incorporate a
    range of assumptions. Expected volatilities are based
    principally on historical volatility of the Company’s
    stock, and to a lesser extent, on implied volatilities from
    traded options on the Company’s stock. For the

lattice-based

model, historical volatility corresponds to the contractual term
    of the options granted; whereas, for the

Black-Scholes

model, historical volatility corresponds to the expected term.
    The Company generally uses historical data to estimate option
    exercise and employee termination

within the valuation models; separate groups of employees that
    have similar historical exercise behavior are considered
    separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options
    granted (which is an input to the

Black-Scholes

model and an output from the

lattice-based

model) represents the period of time that options granted are
    expected to be outstanding; the

weighted-average

expected term for all employee groups is presented in the
    following table. The

risk-free

rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is
    based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
    time of grant.

Other
    stock-based awards

During the periods presented, other

stock-based

awards consisted principally of executive performance shares and
    restricted stock granted under the 2003 Plan.

In 2007, the Company granted performance shares to a limited
    number of senior

executive-level

employees, which entitle these employees to receive a specified
    number of shares of the Company’s common stock on the
    vesting date, provided cumulative

three-year

cash flow targets are achieved. In 2006 and 2005, the Company
    granted performance shares to a limited number of senior

executive-level

employees, which entitled these employees to receive a specified
    number of shares of the Company’s common stock on the
    vesting date, provided cumulative

three-year

net sales growth targets were achieved. Subsequent to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), management has estimated
    the fair value of performance share awards based on the market
    price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, reduced by
    the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the
    performance period. The 2007, 2006 and 2005 target grants (as
    revised for

non-vested

forfeitures and other adjustments) currently correspond to
    approximately 205,000, 250,000 and 270,000 shares,
    respectively; with a

grant-date

fair value of approximately $46, $41, and $41 per share. The
    actual number of shares issued on the vesting date could range
    from zero to 200% of target, depending on actual performance
    achieved. Based on the market price of the Company’s common
    stock at

year-end

2007, the maximum future value that could be awarded on the
    vesting date is (in millions): 2007

award–$22;


award–$27;

and 2005

award–$28.

The Company also periodically grants restricted stock and
    restricted stock units to eligible employees under the 2003
    Plan. Restrictions with respect to sale or transferability
    generally lapse after three years and the grantee is normally
    entitled to receive shareholder dividends during the vesting
    period. Management estimates the fair value of restricted stock
    grants based on the market price of the underlying stock on the
    date of grant. A summary of restricted stock activity for the
    year ended December 29, 2007, is presented in the following

NOTE 9

PENSION
    BENEFITS

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign pension
    plans to provide retirement benefits for its employees. The
    majority of these plans are funded or unfunded defined benefit
    plans, although the Company does participate in a limited number
    of multiemployer or other defined contribution plans for certain
    employee groups. Defined benefits for salaried employees are
    generally based on salary and years of service, while union
    employee benefits are generally a negotiated amount for each
    year of service. The Company uses its fiscal year end as the
    measurement date for its defined benefit plans.

Obligations
    and funded status

The aggregate change in projected benefit obligation, plan
    assets, and funded status is presented in the following tables.
    The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” as of the end of its 2006 fiscal year. The standard
    generally requires company plan sponsors to reflect the net
    over- or

under-funded

position of a defined postretirement benefit plan as an asset or
    liability on the balance sheet.

Expense

The components of pension expense are presented in the following

    principally to multiemployer plans in which the Company
    participates on behalf of certain unionized workforces in the
    United States. The amounts for 2007 and 2006 include charges of
    approximately $6 million and $4 million, respectively,
    for the Company’s current estimate of a multiemployer plan
    withdrawal liability, which is further described in Note 3.

experience gain or loss is amortized using a

method over the average remaining service period of active plan
    participants. Any

    page 49. The estimated net experience loss and prior
    service cost for defined benefit pension plans that will be
    amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into
    pension expense over the next fiscal year are approximately
    $35 million and $13 million, respectively.

Net losses from curtailment and special termination benefits
    recognized in 2006 are related primarily to plant workforce
    reductions in the United States and United Kingdom, as further
    described in Note 3.

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries sponsor 401(k) or
    similar savings plans for active employees. Expense related to
    these plans was (in millions):

2007–$36;

2006–$33;

2005–$30.

Company contributions to these savings plans approximate annual
    expense. Company contributions to multiemployer and other
    defined contribution pension plans approximate the amount of
    annual expense presented in the preceding table.

To determine the overall expected

long-term

rate of return on plan assets, the Company models expected
    returns over a

20-year

investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix
    of its major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a
    combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and

forward-looking

views of the financial markets including consideration of
    current yields on

long-term

bonds,

price-earnings

ratios of the major stock market indices, and

long-term

inflation. The U.S. model, which corresponds to
    approximately 70% of consolidated pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan assets, incorporates a

long-term

inflation assumption of 2.7% and an active management premium of
    1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Similar
    methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets,
    reflecting local economic conditions. Although management
    reviews the Company’s expected

long-term

rates of return annually, the benefit trust investment
    performance for one particular year does not, by itself,
    significantly influence this evaluation. The expected rates of
    return are generally not revised, provided these rates continue
    to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of
    between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected

long-term

returns, as determined by the Company’s modeling process.
    The expected rate of return for 2007 of 8.9% equated to
    approximately the 50th percentile expectation. Any future
    variance between the expected and actual rates of return on plan
    assets is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over
    a

five-year

period and once recognized, experience gains and losses are
    amortized using a

declining-balance

method over the average remaining service period of active plan
    participants.

The Company’s investment strategy for its major defined
    benefit plans is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset
    classes with the primary goal of meeting

long-term

cash requirements as they become due. Assets are invested in a
    prudent manner to maintain the security of funds while
    maximizing returns within the Company’s guidelines. The
    current

weighted-average

target asset allocation reflected by this strategy is: equity

securities–75%;

debt

securities–23%;

other–2%.

Investment in Company common stock represented 1.5% of
    consolidated plan assets at December 29, 2007 and
    December 30, 2006. Plan funding strategies are influenced
    by tax regulations. The Company currently expects to contribute
    approximately $50 million to its defined benefit pension
    plans during 2008.

NOTE 10

NONPENSION
    POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Postretirement

The Company sponsors a number of plans to provide health care
    and other welfare benefits to retired employees in the United
    States and Canada, who have met certain age and service
    requirements. The majority of these plans are funded or unfunded
    defined benefit plans, although the Company does participate in
    a limited number of multiemployer or other defined contribution
    plans for certain employee groups. The Company contributes to
    voluntary employee benefit association (VEBA) trusts to fund
    certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit
    obligations. The Company uses its fiscal year end as the
    measurement date for these plans.

Obligations
    and funded status

The aggregate change in accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation, plan assets, and funded status is presented in the
    following tables. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans” as of the end of its 2006
    fiscal year. The standard generally requires company plan
    sponsors to reflect the net over- or

Any arising health care claims

cost-related

experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount
    of claims experience over a

four-year

period and once recognized, is amortized using a

straight-line

method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum
    amortization prescribed by SFAS No. 106. Any

asset-related

experience gain or loss is recognized as described for pension
    plans on page 49. The estimated net experience loss for
    defined benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated
    other comprehensive income into nonpension postretirement
    benefit expense over the next fiscal year is approximately
    $9 million, partially offset by amortization of prior
    service credit of $3 million.

Net losses from curtailment and special termination benefits
    recognized in 2006 are related primarily to plant workforce
    reductions in the United States as further described in
    Note 3.

The assumed health care cost trend rate is 8.5% for 2008,
    decreasing gradually to 4.75% by the year 2012 and remaining at
    that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect the
    Company’s recent historical experience and
    management’s expectations regarding future trends. A one

    expects to contribute approximately $13 million to its VEBA
    trusts during 2008.



Postemployment

Under certain conditions, the Company provides benefits to
    former or inactive employees in the United States and several
    foreign locations, including salary continuance, severance, and

long-term

disability. The Company recognizes an obligation for any of
    these benefits that vest or accumulate with service.
    Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with
    service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather
    than years of service) or costs arising from actions that offer
    benefits to employees in excess of those specified in the
    respective plans are charged to expense when incurred. The
    Company’s postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.
    Actuarial assumptions used are generally consistent with those
    presented for pension benefits on page 48. The aggregate

    compared to approximately 32% in 2006 and 31% in 2005. The 2007
    effective income tax rate was lower than the two preceding years
    due principally to the favorable effect of several discrete
    adjustments. In the first quarter of 2007, management
    implemented an international restructuring initiative which
    eliminated a foreign tax liability of approximately
    $40 million. Accordingly, the reversal was recorded within
    the Company’s consolidated provision for income taxes. The
    Company benefited from statutory rate reductions, primarily in
    the United Kingdom and in Germany which resulted in an
    $11 million reduction to income tax expense. These rate
    reductions will first be applicable to income taxed in 2008 and
    amounted to two percentage points in the United Kingdom and ten
    percentage points in Germany, partially offset by the effect of
    other German tax law changes. During 2007, the Company
    repatriated approximately $327 million of current year
    foreign earnings, for a gross U.S. tax cost of $35
    million. This cost was offset by foreign tax credit related
    items of $31 million, reducing the net cost of repatriation
    to $4 million. At December 29, 2007, accumulated
    foreign subsidiary earnings of approximately $1.3 billion
    were considered permanently invested in those businesses.
    Accordingly, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on
    these earnings.

In addition to the aforementioned statutory rate reductions
    enacted in the Company’s fiscal third quarter, the
    government of Mexico enacted a tax reform package. Beginning in
    2008, corporate entities will pay the higher of traditional
    income tax (generally imposed at a rate of 28%) or a new
    corporate flat tax, which is phased in at a rate of 16.5% in
    2008 to 17.5% by 2010. Under the new flat tax, allowable
    deductions, such as interest expense, are limited. The Company
    has evaluated the impact of the Mexican tax law reform on its
    Latin American operations. A valuation allowance of
    $3 million has been recorded against certain deferred tax
    assets. In addition, this tax reform will result in a slight
    increase to the Company’s consolidated effective income tax
    rate, beginning in 2008.

The Company’s 2006 consolidated effective tax rate included
    two significant, but

partially-offsetting,

discrete adjustments. The Company reduced its reserves for
    uncertain tax positions by $25 million, related principally
    to the closure of several domestic tax audits. In addition, the
    Company revised its repatriation plan for certain foreign
    earnings, giving rise to an incremental net tax cost of
    $18 million.

Generally, the changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax
    assets and corresponding impacts on the effective income tax
    rate result from management’s assessment of the
    Company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions,
    operating losses and tax credit carryforwards prior to
    expiration. For 2007, the .5% rate reduction presented in the
    preceding table primarily reflects the reversal of a valuation
    allowance against U.S. foreign tax credits which were
    utilized in conjunction with the aforementioned 2007 foreign
    earnings repatriation. Total tax benefits of carryforwards at

year-end

2007 and 2006 were approximately $17 million and
    $29 million, respectively, with related valuation
    allowances at

year-end

2007 and 2006 of approximately $17 and $28 million. Of the
    total carryforwards at

year-end

2007, less than $2 million expire in 2008 with the
    remainder principally expiring after five years.

The following table provides an analysis of the Company’s
    deferred tax assets and liabilities as of

year-end

2007 and 2006. The significant decline in the “employee
    benefits” caption of the Company’s noncurrent deferred
    tax asset during 2007 is principally related to net experience
    gains associated with employer pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans that are recorded in other comprehensive income,
    net of tax.

Uncertain
    tax positions

The Company adopted Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN No. 48) as of the beginning of its 2007
    fiscal year. This interpretation clarifies what criteria must be
    met prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit, in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes,” of a position taken in a tax return.

Prior to adopting FIN No. 48, the Company’s
    policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable
    outcome of known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution was
    recognized as a reduction to the effective income tax rate in
    the period of resolution. As compared to a contingency approach,
    FIN No. 48 is based on a benefit recognition model.
    Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of
    being sustained, FIN No. 48 permits a company to
    recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon
    settlement. The tax position must be derecognized when it is no
    longer more likely than not of being sustained. The initial
    application of FIN No. 48 resulted in a net decrease
    to the Company’s consolidated accrued income tax and
    related interest liabilities of approximately $2 million,
    with an offsetting increase to retained earnings.

The Company files income taxes in the U.S. federal
    jurisdiction, and in various state, local, and foreign
    jurisdictions. For the past several years, the Company’s
    annual provision for U.S. federal income taxes has
    represented approximately 70% of the Company’s consolidated
    income tax provision. With limited exceptions, the Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) for years prior to 2004. During the first
    quarter of 2007, the IRS commenced an examination of the
    Company’s 2004 and 2005 U.S. federal income tax
    returns, which is anticipated to be completed during the second
    half of 2008. The Company is also under examination for income
    and

non-income

tax filings in various state and foreign jurisdictions, most
    notably: 1) a

U.S.-Canadian

transfer pricing issue pending international arbitration
    (“Competent Authority”) with a related advanced
    pricing agreement for years

1997-2008;

and 2) an

on-going

examination of

2002-2004

U.K. income tax filings, with an examination of the 2005 filing,
    which began in July 2007.

As of December 29, 2007, the Company has classified
    approximately $36 million of unrecognized tax benefits as a
    current liability, representing several individually
    insignificant income tax positions under examination in various
    jurisdictions. Management’s estimate of reasonably possible
    changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve
    months is comprised of the aforementioned current liability
    balance expected to be settled within one year, offset by
    approximately $29 million of projected additions related
    primarily to ongoing intercompany transfer pricing activity.
    Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that
    could result in significant additional payments, accruals, or
    other material deviation in this estimate.

Following is a reconciliation of the Company’s total gross
    unrecognized tax benefits as of the year ended December 29,
    2007. Approximately $147 million of this total represents
    the amount that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s
    effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs
    from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table
    due to the decrease in U.S. federal income taxes which
    would occur upon recognition of the state tax benefits included
    therein.

The Company classifies income

tax-related

interest and penalties as interest expense and selling, general,
    and administrative expense, respectively. For the year ended
    December 29, 2007, the Company recognized $9 million
    of

interest and penalties and had approximately $31 million
    accrued at December 29, 2007.



NOTE 12

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS AND CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATION

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are
    based on carrying value in the case of

short-term

items, quoted market prices for derivatives and investments, and
    in the case of

long-term

debt, incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans
    with similar terms and maturities. The carrying amounts of the
    Company’s cash, cash equivalents, receivables, and notes
    payable approximate fair value. The fair value of the
    Company’s

long-term

debt at December 29, 2007, exceeded its carrying value by
    approximately $251 million.

The Company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a
    part of its ongoing business operations. Management uses
    derivative financial and commodity instruments, where
    appropriate, to manage these risks. In general, instruments used
    as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk associated with
    the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at
    the inception of the contract. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, the Company designates derivatives as
    either cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment
    hedges, or other contracts used to reduce volatility in the
    translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. Dollars.
    The fair values of all hedges are recorded in accounts
    receivable or other current liabilities. Gains and losses
    representing either hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components
    excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or hedges of
    translational exposure are recorded in other income (expense),
    net. Within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,
    settlements of cash flow and fair value hedges are classified as
    an operating activity; settlements of all other derivatives are
    classified as a financing activity.

Cash
    flow hedges

Qualifying derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges
    when the hedged item is a forecasted transaction. Gains and
    losses on these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive
    income until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings.
    When the hedged item is realized, gains or losses are
    reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the
    Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the same line item as the
    underlying transaction. For all cash flow hedges, gains and
    losses representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge
    components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness were
    insignificant during the periods presented.

The total net loss attributable to cash flow hedges recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive income at December 29,
    2007, was $6 million, related primarily to forward interest
    rate contracts settled during 2001 and 2003 in conjunction with
    fixed rate

long-term

debt issuances partially offset by

10-year

natural gas price swaps entered into in 2006. The interest rate
    contract losses will be reclassified into interest expense over
    the next 24 years. The natural gas swap losses will be
    reclassified to cost of goods sold over the next 9 years.
    Other insignificant amounts related to foreign currency and
    commodity price cash flow hedges will be reclassified into
    earnings during the next 18 months.

Fair
    value hedges

Qualifying derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges
    when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm
    commitment. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded
    in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. For
    all fair value hedges, gains and losses representing either
    hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the
    assessment of effectiveness were insignificant during the
    periods presented.

Net
    investment hedges

Qualifying derivative and nonderivative financial instruments
    are accounted for as net investment hedges when the hedged item
    is a nonfunctional currency investment in a subsidiary. Gains
    and losses on these instruments are recorded as a foreign
    currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income.

Other
    contracts

The Company also periodically enters into foreign currency
    forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in the
    translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. Dollars.
    Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in other
    income (expense), net, generally reducing the exposure to
    translation volatility during a

full-year

period.

Foreign
    exchange risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash
    flows related primarily to

third-party

purchases, intercompany transactions, and nonfunctional currency
    denominated

third-party

debt. The Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value
    of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows
    related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, the
    Company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign
    currency earnings to U.S. Dollars. Management assesses
    foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and
    translational volatility and enters into forward contracts,
    options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long
    or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are
    generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap
    agreements are established in conjunction with the term of
    underlying debt issues.

For foreign currency cash flow and fair value hedges, the
    assessment of effectiveness is generally based on changes in
    spot rates. Changes in time value are reported in other income
    (expense), net.



Interest
    rate risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard
    to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of
    variable rate debt. The Company periodically uses interest rate
    swaps, including

forward-starting

swaps, to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs
    associated with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired
    proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current
    and projected market conditions.

Variable-to-fixed

interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and
    the assessment of effectiveness is based on changes in the
    present value of interest payments on the underlying debt.

Fixed-to-variable

interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and
    the assessment of effectiveness is based on changes in the fair
    value of the underlying debt, using incremental borrowing rates
    currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities.

Price
    risk

The Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a
    result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials,
    fuel, and energy. The Company has historically used the
    combination of

long-term

contracts with suppliers, and

exchange-traded

futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a
    desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a
    duration of generally less than 18 months. During 2006, the
    Company entered into two separate

10-year

over-the-counter

commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price
    of natural gas used principally in its manufacturing processes.

Commodity contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
    assessment of effectiveness for

exchange-traded

instruments is based on changes in futures prices. The
    assessment of effectiveness for

over-the-counter

transactions is based on changes in designated indexes.

Credit
    risk concentration

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by counterparties on derivative financial and
    commodity contracts. This credit loss is limited to the cost of
    replacing these contracts at current market rates. Management
    believes the probability of such loss is remote.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash
    equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company places its
    investments in highly rated financial institutions and

investment-grade

short-term

debt instruments, and limits the amount of credit exposure to
    any one entity. Management believes concentrations of credit
    risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the
    generally high credit quality of the Company’s major
    customers, as well as the large number and geographic dispersion
    of smaller customers. However, the Company conducts a
    disproportionate amount of business with a small number of large
    multinational grocery retailers, with the five largest accounts
    comprising approximately 27% of consolidated accounts receivable
    at December 29, 2007.

Management’s
    Responsibility for

Financial
    Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    notes. We believe that the consolidated financial statements
    present the Company’s financial position and results of
    operations in conformity with accounting principles that are
    generally accepted in the United States, using our best
    estimates and judgments as required.

The independent registered public accounting firm audits the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board and provides an objective, independent review of the
    fairness of reported operating results and financial position.

The Board of Directors of the Company has an Audit Committee
    composed of three

non-management

Directors. The Committee meets regularly with management,
    internal auditors, and the independent registered public
    accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing
    and financial reporting matters.

Formal policies and procedures, including an active Ethics and
    Business Conduct program, support the internal controls and are
    designed to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of
    personal and professional integrity. We have a vigorous internal
    audit program that independently evaluates the adequacy and
    effectiveness of these internal controls.

Management’s
    Report on Internal

Control over
    Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have excluded the Bear Naked and Gardenburger businesses from
    our assessment of internal control over financial reporting
    because those businesses were acquired in November 2007. The
    total assets and net sales of these businesses represent
    $131 million and $3 million, respectively, of the
    related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for
    the year ending December 29, 2007.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

, management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 29, 2007. The effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 29, 2007 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which follows.

Chief Financial Officer, Kellogg Company and

President, Kellogg North America



REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board
    of Directors

of Kellogg Company:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Kellogg Company
    and its subsidiaries at December 29, 2007 and
    December 30, 2006, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 29, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 29, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 8.
    Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements and on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
    our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounted
    for

share-based

compensation and defined pension, other postretirement and
    postemployment plans in 2006. Also, as discussed in Note 1
    to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
    the manner in which it accounted for uncertain tax positions in
    2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8, management
    has excluded the Bear Naked and Gardenburger businesses from its
    assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 29, 2007 because those businesses were acquired in
    November 2007. We have also excluded Bear Naked and Gardenburger
    from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The
    total assets and net sales of these businesses represent
    $131 million and $3 million, respectively, of the
    related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for
    the year ended December 29, 2007.

ROCEDURES

(a) We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
    our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure under

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e).

Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, rather than absolute,
    assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

As of December 29, 2007, management carried out an
    evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
    reasonable assurance level.

(b) Pursuant to Section 404 of the

Sarbanes-Oxley

Act of 2002, we have included a report of management’s
    assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as part of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

The independent registered public accounting firm of
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also attested to, and reported on,
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting. Management’s report and the independent
    registered public accounting firm’s attestation report are
    included in our 2007 financial statements in Item 8 of this
    Report under the captions entitled “Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” and
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm” and are incorporated herein by reference.

(c) During the last fiscal quarter, there have been no
    changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Five plans (including one individual compensation arrangement)
    are considered “Equity compensation plans not approved by
    security holders”. The Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, which
    was adopted in 2002 and is available to most U.K. employees of
    specified Kellogg Company subsidiaries; a similar plan, which is
    available to employees in the Republic of Ireland; the Kellogg
    Company Executive Stock Purchase Plan, which was adopted in 2002
    and is available to selected senior level Kellogg
    employees; the Deferred Compensation Plan for

Non-Employee

Directors, which was adopted in 1986 and amended in 1993 and
    2002; and a

non-qualified

stock option granted in 2000 to Mr. Jenness, when he had
    just been appointed a Kellogg director.

Under the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, eligible U.K. employees
    may contribute up to 1,500 Pounds Sterling annually to the plan
    through payroll deductions. The trustees of the plan use those
    contributions to buy shares of our common stock at fair market
    value on the open market, with Kellogg matching those
    contributions on a 1:1 basis. Shares must be withdrawn from the
    plan when employees cease employment. Under current law,
    eligible employees generally receive certain income and other
    tax benefits if those shares are held in the plan for a
    specified number of years. A similar plan is also available to
    employees in the Republic of Ireland. As these plans are open
    market plans with no set overall maximum, no amounts for these
    plans are included in the above table. However, approximately
    75,000 shares were purchased by eligible employees under
    the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, the plan for the Republic of
    Ireland and other similar predecessor plans during 2007, with
    approximately an additional 75,000 shares being provided as
    matched shares.

Under the Kellogg Company Executive Stock Purchase Plan,
    selected senior level Kellogg employees may elect to use
    all or part of their annual bonus, on an

after-tax

basis, to purchase shares of our common stock at fair market
    value (as determined over a

thirty-day

trading period). No more than 500,000 treasury shares are
    authorized for use under this plan.

Under the Deferred Compensation Plan for

Non-Employee

Directors,

non-employee

Directors may elect to defer all or part of their compensation
    (other than expense reimbursement) into units which are credited
    to their accounts. The units have a value equal to the fair
    market value of a share of our common stock on the appropriate
    date, with dividend equivalents being earned on the whole units
    in

non-employee

Directors’ accounts. Units may be paid in either cash or
    shares of our common stock, either in a lump sum or in up to ten
    annual installments, with the payments to begin as soon as
    practicable after the

non-employee

Director’s service as a Director terminates. No more than
    150,000 shares are authorized for use under this plan, of
    which approximately 11,000 had been issued as of
    December 29, 2007. Because Directors may elect, and are
    likely to elect, a distribution of cash rather than shares, the
    contingently issuable shares are not included in column
    (a) of the table above.

When Mr. Jenness joined Kellogg as a director in 2000, he
    was granted a

non-qualified

stock option to purchase 300,000 shares of our common
    stock. In connection with this option, which was to vest over
    three annual installments, he agreed to devote 50% of his
    working time to consulting with Kellogg, with further vesting to
    immediately stop if he was no longer willing to devote such
    amount of time to consulting with Kellogg or if Kellogg decided
    that it no longer wishes to receive such services. During 2001,
    Kellogg



and Mr. Jenness agreed to terminate the consulting
    relationship, which immediately terminated the unvested
    200,000 shares. This option contains the AOF feature
    described in the Proxy Statement.
