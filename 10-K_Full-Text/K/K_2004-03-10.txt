PART I

Item 1.

Business

The Company.

Kellogg
Company, incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries
are engaged in the manufacture and marketing of ready-to-eat
cereal and convenience foods.

The address of the principal business office of
Kellogg Company is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599,
Battle Creek, Michigan Creek 49016-3599. Unless otherwise
specified or indicated by the context, the term
“Company” as used in this report means Kellogg
Company, its divisions and subsidiaries.

Information about the Keebler Foods Company
acquisition in 2001 is incorporated by reference herein from
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 37 and 38 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Financial Information About Segments.

The information called for by this
Item is incorporated herein by reference from Note 14 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 49 and 50 of
the Company’s Annual Report.

Principal Products.

The principal products of the Company
are ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, such as cookies,
crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, frozen waffles and meat
alternatives. These products were, as of December 27, 2003,
manufactured by the Company in 17 countries and marketed in more
than 180 countries. The Company’s cereal products are
generally marketed under the

Kellogg’s

name
and are sold principally to the grocery trade through direct
sales forces for resale to consumers. The Company uses broker
and distribution arrangements for certain products. It also
generally uses these, or similar arrangements, in less-developed
market areas or in those market areas outside of its focus.

The Company also markets cookies, crackers, and
other convenience foods, under brands such as

Kellogg’s, Keebler, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin

and

Famous Amos,

to supermarkets in the United
States through a direct store door (DSD) delivery system,
although other distribution methods are also used.

Additional information pertaining to the relative
sales of the Company’s products for the years 2001 through
2003 is found in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 49 and 50 of the Company’s Annual
Report.

Raw Materials.

Agricultural commodities are the
principal raw materials used in the Company’s products.
Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging
materials used by the Company. World supplies and prices of such
commodities (which include such packaging materials) are
constantly monitored, as are government trade policies. The cost
of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government
policy and regulation, weather conditions, or other unforeseen
circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and
improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes
of the Company’s short-term and long-term requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products
produced by the Company in the United States include corn grits,
wheat and wheat derivatives, oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate,
soybeans and soybean derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners,
flour, shortening, dairy products, eggs, and other filling
ingredients, which ingredients are obtained from various
sources. Most of these commodities are purchased principally
from sources in the United States.

The Company enters into long-term contracts for
the commodities described in this section and purchases these
items on the open market, depending on the Company’s view
of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and the
Company’s relative negotiating power. While the cost of
some of these commodities has, and may continue to, increase
over time, the Company believes that it will be able to purchase
an adequate supply of these items as needed. The Company also
uses commodity futures and options to hedge some of its costs.

Raw materials and packaging needed for
internationally based operations are available in adequate
supply and are sometimes imported from countries other than
those where used in manufacture.



Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and
international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or
propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local
suppliers. Short-term standby propane storage exists at several
plants for use in the event of interruption in natural gas
supplies. Oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at
various plants in the event of natural gas shortages or when its
use presents economic advantages. In addition, considerable
amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the
distribution of the Company’s products.

Trademarks and Technology.

Generally, the Company’s products
are marketed under trademarks it owns. The Company’s
principal trademarks are its housemarks, brand names, slogans,

with

L’ Eggo



my Eggo,

used in connection with the Company’s frozen waffles and
pancakes, and

Elfin Magic

used in connection with
convenience food products are also important Company trademarks.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when
taken as a whole, are important to the Company’s business.
Certain individual trademarks are also important to the
Company’s business. Depending on the jurisdiction,
trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or
their registrations are properly maintained and they have not
been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks
can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the
trademarks are in use.

The Company considers that, taken as a whole, the
rights under its various patents, which expire from time to
time, are a valuable asset, but the Company does not believe
that its businesses are materially dependent on any single
patent or group of related patents. The Company’s
activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions
which it holds are similarly a valuable asset, but are not
believed to be material.

Seasonality.

Demand
for the Company’s products has generally been approximately
level throughout the year, although some of the Company’s
convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second
half of the year due to events and holidays. The Company also
custom-bakes cookies for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., which
are principally sold in the first quarter of the year.

Working Capital.

Although terms vary around the world,
in the United States the Company generally has required payment
for goods sold 11 days subsequent to the date of invoice,
generally with a 2% or 1% discount allowed for payment within
ten days. Receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by
borrowings, provide for the Company’s payment of dividends,
capital expansion, and for other operating expenses and working
capital needs.

Customers.

The
Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
affiliates, accounted for approximately 13% of consolidated net
sales during 2003, comprised principally of sales within the
United States. At December 27, 2003, approximately 10% of
the Company’s consolidated receivables balance and 15% of
the Company’s U.S. receivables balance was comprised
of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates.
During 2003, the Company’s top five customers,
collectively, accounted for approximately 27% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales and approximately 36% of
U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide
consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and the
Company believes that this trend is likely to continue. Although
the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time
could negatively impact the Company’s sales and profits,
the Company does not anticipate that this will occur to a
significant extent due to the consumer demand for the
Company’s products and the Company’s relationships
with its customers. Products of the Company have been generally
sold through its own sales forces and through broker and
distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to
consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service
establishments.

Backlog.

For the
most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and
are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The
backlog of any unfilled orders at December 27, 2003, and
December 28, 2002, was not material to the Company.

Competition.

The
Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience,
intense competition for sales of all of its principal products
in its major product categories, both domestically and
internationally. The Company’s products compete with
advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as
unadvertised and private label products, which are typically
distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food
products. Principal methods and factors of competition include
new product introductions, product quality, taste, convenience,
nutritional value, price, advertising, and promotion.

Research and Development.

Research to support and expand the use
of the Company’s existing products and to develop new food
products is carried on at the W.K. Kellogg Institute for
Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at
other locations around the world. The Company’s
expenditures for research and development were approximately
$126.7 million in 2003, $106.4 million in 2002 and
$110.2 million in 2001.



Regulation.

The
Company’s activities in the United States are subject to
regulation by various government agencies, including the Food
and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the
Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as
voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various state and local
agencies also regulate the Company’s activities. Other
agencies and bodies outside of the United States, including
those of the European Union and various countries, states and
municipalities, also regulate the Company’s activities.

Environmental Matters.

The Company’s facilities are
subject to various U.S. and foreign federal, state, and local
laws and regulations regarding the discharge of material into
the environment and the protection of the environment in other
ways. The Company is not a party to any material proceedings
arising under these regulations. The Company believes that
compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will
not materially affect the consolidated financial condition or
the competitive position of the Company. The Company is
currently in substantial compliance with all material
environmental regulations affecting the Company and its
properties.

Employees.

At
December 27, 2003, the Company had approximately 25,250
employees.

This Report contains, or incorporates by
reference, “forward-looking statements” with
projections concerning, among other things, the Company’s
strategy and plans; improvements and growth; sales, gross
margins, brand building, operating profit, and earnings per
share; exit plans and costs related to productivity initiatives;
the impact of accounting changes and FASB authoritative guidance
to be issued; the Company’s ability to meet interest and
debt principal repayment obligations; future common stock
repurchases or debt reduction; effective income tax rate; cash
flow and core working capital improvements; expenditures for
property additions; interest expense; commodity and energy
prices; and employee benefit plan costs and funding.
Forward-looking statements include predictions of future results
or activities and may contain the words “expect,”
“believe,” “will,” “will deliver,”
“anticipate,” “project,” “should,”
or words or phrases of similar meaning. For example,
forward-looking statements are found in this Item 1 and in
several sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
incorporated by reference. The Company’s actual results or
activities may differ materially from these predictions. In
particular, future results or activities could be affected by
the substantial amount of indebtedness incurred to finance the
Keebler acquisition, which could, among other things, hinder the
Company’s ability to adjust rapidly to changing market
conditions, make the Company more vulnerable in the event of a
downturn, and place the Company at a competitive disadvantage in
relation to less-leveraged competitors. The Company’s
future results could be affected by a variety of other factors,
including the impact of competitive conditions; the
effectiveness of pricing, advertising, and promotional programs;
the success of innovation and new product introductions; the
recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other
intangibles; the success of productivity improvements and
business transitions; commodity and energy prices, and labor
costs; the availability of and interest rates on short-term
financing; actual market



performance of benefit plan trust investments;
the levels of spending on systems initiatives, properties,
business opportunities, integration of acquired businesses, and
other general and administrative costs; changes in consumer
behavior and preferences; the effect of U.S. and foreign
economic conditions on items such as interest rates, statutory
tax rates, currency conversion and availability; legal and
regulatory factors; and, business disruption or other losses
from war, terrorist acts, or political unrest. Forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date they were made, and the
Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update them.

Item 2.

Properties

The Company’s corporate headquarters and
principal research and development facilities are located in
Battle Creek, Michigan.

The Company operated, as of December 27,
2003, manufacturing plants and warehouses totaling more than
20 million (20,000,000) square feet of building area
in the United States and other countries. The Company’s
plants have been designed and constructed to meet its specific
production requirements, and the Company periodically invests
money for capital and technological improvements. At the time of
its selection, each location was considered to be favorable,
based on the location of markets, sources of raw materials,
availability of suitable labor, transportation facilities,
location of other Company plants producing similar products, and
other factors. Manufacturing facilities of the Company in the
United States include four cereal plants and warehouses located
in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Memphis,
Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska and other plants in
San Jose, California; Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus,
Macon, and Rome, Georgia; Chicago and Des Plaines, Illinois;

with warehousing facilities, in Australia, Brazil, Canada,
Colombia, Ecuador, Germany, Great Britain, Guatemala, India,
Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and
Venezuela.

The principal properties of the Company,
including its major office facilities, generally are owned by
the Company, although some manufacturing facilities are leased,
and no owned property is subject to any major lien or other
encumbrance. Distribution facilities and offices of non-plant
locations typically are leased. In general, the Company
considers its facilities, taken as a whole, to be suitable,
adequate, and of sufficient capacity for its current operations.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure based on
management’s interpretation of the definition of
“disclosure controls and procedures,” in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, rather than absolute,
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.

As of December 27, 2003, management carried
out an evaluation under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and
the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance.

During the last fiscal quarter, there have been
no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.

    Owners and Management

(a) Refer to the information under the
captions “Security Ownership — Five Percent
Holders” and “Security Ownership — Officer
and Director Stock Ownership” of the Proxy Statement, which
information is incorporated herein by reference.

(b) Securities Authorized for Issuance Under
Equity Compensation Plans

(Millions, except per share data)

Four plans (including one individual compensation
arrangement) are included in “Equity compensation plans not
approved by security holders”: the Kellogg Share Incentive
Plan, which was adopted in 2002 and is available to most U.K.
employees of specified Kellogg Company subsidiaries; a somewhat
similar plan which is available to employees in the Republic of
Ireland; the Kellogg Company Executive Stock Purchase Plan,
which was adopted in 2002 and is available to selected senior
level employees of the Company; and a non-qualified stock option
granted in 2000 to James Jenness, one of the Company’s
directors.

Under the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, eligible
U.K. employees may contribute up to 1500 pounds annually to the
Plan through payroll deductions. The trustees of the Plan use
those contributions to buy shares at fair market value on the
open market, with the Company matching those contributions on a
1:1 basis. Shares must be withdrawn from the Plan when employees
cease employment. Under current law, eligible employees
generally receive specified income and other tax benefits if
those shares are held in the Plan for five years. A somewhat
similar plan is also available to employees in the Republic of
Ireland. As these Plans are open market plans with no set
overall maximum, no amounts for these Plans are included in the
above table. However, approximately 94,000 shares were
purchased by eligible employees under the Kellogg Share
Incentive Plan, the somewhat similar plan in the Republic of
Ireland and somewhat similar predecessor plans during 2003, with
approximately an additional 94,000 shares being provided as
matched shares.

Under the Kellogg Company Executive Stock
Purchase Plan, selected senior level employees may elect to use
all or part of their annual bonus, on an after-tax basis, to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at fair
market value (as determined over a thirty-day trading period).
No more than 500,000 treasury shares are authorized for use
under the Plan.

James Jenness, a director, was granted a
non-qualified stock option in 2000 to purchase
300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. In
connection with this option, which was to vest over three annual
installments, he agreed to devote fifty percent of his working
time to consulting with the Company, with further vesting to
immediately stop if he was no longer willing to devote such
amount of time to consulting with the Company or if the Company
decided that it no longer wishes to receive such services.
During 2001, the Company and Mr. Jenness agreed to
terminate the consulting relationship, which immediately
terminated the unvested 200,000 shares. This option
contains the AOF feature described in the Summary Compensation
Table of the Proxy Statement.
