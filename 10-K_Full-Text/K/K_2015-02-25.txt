PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

The Company.

Kellogg Company, founded
in 1906 and incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and marketing of ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods.

The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek, Michigan 49016-3599. Unless otherwise specified or indicated by the context,
“Kellogg,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Kellogg Company, its divisions and subsidiaries.

Financial Information About Segments.

Information on segments is located in Note 16 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Principal
Products.

Our principal products are ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, such as cookies, crackers, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks, frozen waffles
and veggie foods. These products were, as of February 25, 2015, manufactured by us in 20 countries and marketed in more than 180 countries. Our cereal products are generally marketed under the

Kellogg’s

name and are sold to
the grocery trade through direct sales forces for resale to consumers. We use broker and distributor arrangements for certain products. We also generally use these, or similar arrangements, in less-developed market areas or in those market areas
outside of our focus.

We also market cookies, crackers, crisps, and other convenience foods, under brands such as

Kellogg’s, Keebler,
Cheez-It, Murray, Austin

and

Famous Amos,

to supermarkets in the United States through a direct store-door (DSD) delivery system, although other distribution methods are also used.

Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of our products for the years 2012 through 2014 is located in Note 16 Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8.

Raw
Materials.

Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, potato flakes, soy bean oil, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard, corrugated, and
plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us. We continually monitor world supplies and prices of such commodities (which include such packaging materials), as well as government trade policies. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate
widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, climate change or other unforeseen circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes of our short-term and
long-term requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the United States include corn grits, wheat and wheat derivatives,
potato flakes, oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners, vegetable oils, dairy products, eggs, and other filling ingredients, which are obtained from various sources. While most of these
ingredients are purchased from sources in the United States, some materials are imported due to regional availability and specification requirements.

We enter into long-term contracts for the materials described in this section and purchase these items on the open market, depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and our relative
negotiating power. While the cost of some of these materials has, and may continue to, increase over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of these items as needed. As further discussed herein under Part II,
Item 7A, we also use commodity futures and options to hedge some of our costs.

Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based
operations are available in adequate supply and are sourced both locally and imported from countries other than those where used in manufacturing.

Natural gas and propane are the primary sources of energy used to power processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities, although certain locations
may use oil or propane on a back-up or alternative basis. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. As further discussed herein under Part II, Item 7A, we use
over-the-counter commodity price swaps to hedge some of our natural gas costs.

Trademarks and Technology.

Generally, our
products are marketed under trademarks we own. Our principal trademarks are our housemarks, brand names, slogans, and designs related to cereals and convenience foods manufactured and marketed by us, and we also grant licenses to third parties to

used in connection with

See Veggies Differently

used in connection with meat and egg alternatives and

Everything Pops With Pringles

used in connection with potato crisps are also important Kellogg trademarks.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when taken as a whole, are important to our business. Certain individual trademarks are also important to our business.
Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be
renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use.

We consider that, taken as a whole, the rights under our various patents, which expire from
time to time, are a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Our activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions which we hold are similarly a
valuable asset, but are not believed to be material.

Seasonality.

Demand for our products has generally been approximately level throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and
holidays. We also custom-bake cookies for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., which are principally sold in the first quarter of the year.

Working Capital.

Although terms vary around the world and by business types, in the United States we generally have required payment for
goods sold eleven


or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as 2% 10/net 11 or 1% 15/net 16. Receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide for our payment of dividends,
repurchases of our common stock, capital expansion, and for other operating expenses and working capital needs.

Customers.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 21% of consolidated net sales
during 2014, comprised principally of sales within the United States. At January 3, 2015, approximately 19% of our consolidated receivables balance and 28% of our U.S. receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. and its affiliates. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2014. During 2014, our top five customers, collectively, including Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately
47% of U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry and we believe that this trend is likely to continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively
impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers. Our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces
and through broker and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service establishments.

Backlog.

For the most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject
to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 was not material to us.

Competition.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense
competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label
products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food products. Principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions, product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price,
advertising and promotion.

Research and Development.

Research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is carried on at the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at
other locations around the world. Our expenditures for research and development were approximately (in millions): 2014-$199; 2013-$199; 2012-$206.

Regulation.

Our activities in the
United States are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies.
Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United States, including those of the European Union and various countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our activities.

Environmental Matters.

Our facilities
are subject to various U.S. and foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material proceedings
arising under these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position.

Employees.

At January 3, 2015, we
had approximately 29,790 employees.

Financial Information About Geographic
Areas.

Information on geographic areas is located in Note 16 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8.

actual results or activities may differ materially from these predictions. Our future results could be affected by a variety of factors, including the ability to implement Project K as planned, whether the expected amount of costs associated with
Project K will exceed forecasts, whether the Company will be able to realize the anticipated benefits from Project K in the amounts and times expected, the ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from acquired businesses in the
amounts and at the times expected, the impact of competitive conditions; the effectiveness of pricing, advertising, and promotional programs; the success of innovation, renovation and new product introductions; the recoverability of the carrying
value of goodwill and other intangibles; the success of productivity improvements and business transitions; commodity and energy prices; labor costs; disruptions or inefficiencies in supply chain; the availability of and interest rates on short-term
and long-term financing; actual market performance of benefit plan trust investments; the levels of spending on systems initiatives, properties, business opportunities, integration of acquired businesses, and other general and administrative costs;

safety, advertising and labeling laws and regulations; the ultimate impact of product recalls; business disruption or other losses from war, terrorist acts, or political unrest; risks generally associated with global operations; risks from certain
emerging markets; other items; and the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A below. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In
addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.

We may not realize the benefits that we
expect from our global four-year efficiency and effectiveness program (Project K).

In November 2013, the Company announced a global four-year
efficiency and effectiveness program (Project K). The successful implementation of Project K presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties,
including labor organizations, suppliers, business partners, and other stakeholders. In addition, the project may not advance our business strategy as expected. As a result, we may not be able to


implement Project K as planned, including realizing, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits from our program. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays
and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the program,
our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement Project K in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, the complexity of Project K will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully implement
administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of Project K. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating
personnel and financial or other systems, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. As a result our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely
affected.

Our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, including agricultural
commodities, fuel and labor.

Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in
our products. Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, climate change or other unforeseen
circumstances. To the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes, the results of
our operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials. Our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase, resulting in
an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly
fueled by natural gas or propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Short-term stand-by propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies. Oil may also be used to fuel
certain operations at various plants. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy
and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.

A shortage in the labor pool, failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements, or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost,
which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.

Our labor costs include the cost of
providing benefits for employees. We sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the United States and various foreign locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active health care, severance and other postemployment benefits.
We also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations. Our major pension plans and U.S. retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified
portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. The annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual
rate of return on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount rate used to measure obligations, the rate or trend of health care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements. Many of our
employees are covered by collectively-bargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectively-bargained agreements. Strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on
satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms, which could adversely impact our operating results. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our
ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency.

Multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business.

We participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. We make
periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or
withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. In the event
that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans,


then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a
liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits. In the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining
agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan, and in that event, we could face a withdrawal liability. Some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant
underfunded liabilities. Such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability.

We operate in the highly competitive food
industry.

We face competition across our product lines, including ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, from other companies which have
varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions. Most of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices,
increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful
in introducing new products.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. In addition, the
loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
accounted for approximately 21% of consolidated net sales during 2014, comprised principally of sales within the United States. At January 3, 2015, approximately 19% of our consolidated receivables balance and 28% of our U.S. receivables
balance was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2014. During 2014, our top five customers, collectively, including Wal-Mart, accounted for
approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 47% of U.S. net sales. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger, our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve
their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our profitability or volume
growth could be negatively affected. The loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits.

Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.

We have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our
business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of
factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver
consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, Kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and
opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about Kellogg, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation, regardless of the information’s accuracy. The harm may be immediate
without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Brand recognition can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, as well as our use of social media. If we do not maintain the favorable
perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted.

Tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing
authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.

The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S.
and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various foreign jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The future effective tax rate could be
effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes possible U.S. tax reform and
contemplated changes in the UK and other countries of long-standing tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.

We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the U.S. Although we believe our tax
estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and


penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial
position.

The cash we generate outside the U.S. is principally to be used to fund our international development. If the funds generated by our U.S.
business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the U.S., we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the U.S. Such international earnings would be subject to U.S. tax which could cause our worldwide
effective tax rate to increase.

We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in
tariffs, including value added tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in markets in which we are currently active, or may be active in the future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have
an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.

If our food products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need
to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result.

Selling food products involves a number of legal
and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded. We may also be liable if the consumption of any of
our products causes injury, illness or death. A widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a
period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer
confidence in our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. Moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not pursued, the
negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands.

We could
also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage
consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.

Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability, including manufacturing or distribution capabilities, and that of our
suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of
climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, or other reasons, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate
the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply
chain.

Evolving tax, environmental, food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, labeling, trade, food
quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.

Our activities or
products, both in and outside of the United States, are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as similar and other authorities outside of the United States, International Accords and Treaties and others, including voluntary regulation by other bodies. In
addition, legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed, and less certain. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors,
including political, economic or social events. The manufacturing, marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements. Those regulations control such matters as food
quality and safety, ingredients, advertising, product or production requirements, labeling, import or export of our products or ingredients, relations with distributors and retailers, health and safety, the environment, and restrictions on the use
of government programs, such as Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, to purchase certain of our products. We are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, tax, anticorruption
standards, advertising and claims, and environmental matters. The need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax, environmental, food quality and safety, labeling or other laws or regulations, or new, evolving or changed interpretations or
enforcement of existing laws or regulations, may have


a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to
civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or permits, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if regulatory review does not
result in these types of determinations, it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation.

Our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results.

We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro,
British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and Russian ruble. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has
not changed in their original currency.

If we pursue strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to
successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.

From time to time, we may evaluate potential
acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. With respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or
achieve expected returns, expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges, or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty
in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges. Companies or
operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. Our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including
diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions could also
result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business.

There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil, criminal or regulatory actions, including under general, commercial, employment,
environmental, food quality and safety, anti-trust and trade, advertising and claims, and environmental laws and regulations, or in asserting its rights under various laws. For example, our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or
deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs. In addition, we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or
meeting new legal requirements. The costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us, and new legal requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations.

Our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes.

There are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole. These include changing consumer dietary trends and the
availability of substitute products.

Our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process
development and product relaunches in response to such changes. We aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote
significant focus to the development of new products and to the research, development and technology process functions of our business, we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. Our
future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved
products in these changing markets.

Our postretirement benefit-related costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in
the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions.

Increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits
may continue and negatively affect


our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation, the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance
of our pension and post-retirement plan assets, potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations, and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and
post-retirement plan assets assumptions. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest
rates, which may change based on economic conditions. The Company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly those due to the change in the
fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets and interest rates. In addition, funding requirements for our plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest
rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and post-retirement funding obligations.

We
have a substantial amount of indebtedness.

We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity. As of
January 3, 2015, we had total debt of approximately $7.4 billion and total Kellogg Company equity of $2.8 billion.

Our substantial
indebtedness could have important consequences, including:

•

impairing the ability to access global capital markets to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes,
particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward or if a rating organization announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade;

•

a downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly our short-term credit rating, would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue, increase our
commercial paper borrowing costs, or both;

•

restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or
our business;

•

requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds
available to us for other purposes such as expansion through acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchasing shares, marketing spending and expansion of our product offerings; and

•

causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which
in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions, the availability of, and interest rates on, short-term financing, and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.

Our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies.

Customer and
consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions, or other economic downturns in the United States or other nations. Our results in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be,
materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the United States and other countries, including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business, the financial markets through which we access capital and
currency, political unrest and terrorist acts in the United States or other countries in which we carry on business.

Current economic conditions
globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers. This could result in reductions in sales of our products, reduced acceptance of innovations, and increased price competition. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of
the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may
consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and increased volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. There could be a
number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business, which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers, including our suppliers, co-manufacturers and distributors. A disruption in
financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated
operating results and net worth.

The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets
and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying


value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, trade names, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to
contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. If carrying value exceeds current fair value, the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a
charge to earnings. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) higher commodity prices; (iii) lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result
of increased competition; and (iv) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events. Should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated earnings and net worth
may be materially adversely affected.

As of January 3, 2015, the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately $7.3 billion, of
which $5.0 billion was goodwill and $2.3 billion represented trademarks, tradenames, and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of $15.1 billion and total Kellogg Company equity of $2.8 billion.

We must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands.

In nearly all of our product categories, we compete with well-branded products as well as retailer and other economy brands. Our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives,
particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors’ products or if
consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands, then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings, which could have a material effect on our business
and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.

We may not achieve our targeted cost
savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives.

Our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly
competitive industry. We have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities. Ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production, procurement, or logistical changes and
these, as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.

Technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.

We increasingly rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information
technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. Information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of personal data of,
our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our
control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. Moreover, our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be subjected to
computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks. These events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative
consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage. Furthermore, if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information, we may suffer reputational, competitive
and/or business harm. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our
information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems.

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of
our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of
third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current
legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.


We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands or products.
Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Third party claims of intellectual property
infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.

We are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally.

We are a global company
and generated 39% of our 2014 and 2013 net sales, and 37% of our 2012 net sales outside the United States. We manufacture our products in 20 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries, so we are subject to risks inherent in
multinational operations. Those risks include:

•

compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as OFAC trade sanction regulations and Anti-Boycott regulations,

•

compliance with anti-corruption laws, including U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and U.K. Bribery Act (UKBA),

•

compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple
regimes,

•

changes in tax laws, interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes,

•

fluctuations in currency values, especially in emerging markets,

•

changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls,

•

discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies,

•

increased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments,

•

varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights,

•

greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles,

•

design and implementation of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base, and

•

imposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our sales or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect
our sales.

In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political
unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. We could also be adversely impacted by continued
instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the European Union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the United States. All of these factors could result in increased
costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Our
operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks.

Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to
expand our operations in emerging markets. However, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets. In many countries
outside of the United States, particularly those with emerging economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the FCPA and the UKBA, or local
anti-bribery laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials, including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do
business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve
their production capacities. Our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy. If we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political, economic and currency volatility, our product
sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF
COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate
headquarters and principal research and development facilities are located in Battle Creek, Michigan.

We operated, as of February 25, 2015,
manufacturing plants and distribution and warehousing facilities totaling more than 35 million square feet of building


area in the United States and other countries. Our plants have been designed and constructed to meet our specific production requirements, and we periodically invest money for capital and
technological improvements. At the time of its selection, each location was considered to be favorable, based on the location of markets, sources of raw materials, availability of suitable labor, transportation facilities, location of our other
plants producing similar products, and other factors. Our manufacturing facilities in the United States include four cereal plants and warehouses located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska and
other plants or facilities in San Jose, California; Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, and Rome, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Seelyville, Indiana; Kansas City, Kansas; Florence, Louisville, and Pikeville, Kentucky; Grand Rapids and Wyoming, Michigan;
Blue Anchor, New Jersey; Cary, North Carolina; Cincinnati and Zanesville, Ohio; Muncy, Pennsylvania; Jackson and Rossville, Tennessee; Clearfield, Utah; and Allyn, Washington.

Outside the United States, we had, as of February 25, 2015, additional manufacturing locations, some with warehousing facilities, in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Germany, Great
Britain, India, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and Venezuela.

We generally own our principal properties,
including our major office facilities, although some manufacturing facilities are leased, and no owned property is subject to any major lien or other encumbrance. Distribution facilities (including related warehousing facilities) and offices of
non-plant locations typically are leased. In general, we consider our facilities, taken as a whole, to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient capacity for our current operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and
governmental inspections, audits or investigations arising out of our business which cover matters such as general commercial, governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability, environmental, intellectual property,
employment and other actions. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE

PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Information on the market for our common stock, number of shareowners and dividends is located in Note 15 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2014, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $1.5
billion through December 2015. This authorization supersedes the April 2013 authorization and is intended to allow us to repurchase shares for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs.

The following table provides information with respect to purchases of common shares under programs authorized by our board of directors during the quarter ended
January 3, 2015.


ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries

Selected Financial Data

(a)

Comparable net sales, comparable gross profit as a percentage of net sales, comparable operating profit, comparable operating profit as a percentage of net sales, comparable net
income attributable to Kellogg Company, comparable basic earnings per share, and comparable diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures which are reconciled to the directly comparable measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP within our
Management’s Discussion and Analysis. We believe the use of such non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists in understanding our comparable operating performance.

(b)

We use this non-GAAP financial measure, which is reconciled above, to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distribution,
acquisition opportunities, and share repurchase.

(c)

Interest coverage ratio is calculated based on comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company before interest expense, comparable income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, divided by interest expense.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business overview

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report.

For more than 100 years, consumers have
counted on Kellogg for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. Kellogg is the world’s leading producer of cereal, second largest producer of cookies and crackers, and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods. Additional
product offerings include toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally.

We manage our operations through eight operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location. These operating segments are evaluated for
similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments. We report results
of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Morning Foods; U.S. Snacks; U.S. Specialty; North America Other; Europe; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in Note 16 within Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

We manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our long-term annual growth targets. In February 2015
we announced a change to our long-term annual growth target for comparable net sales. Our targeted long-term annual growth for comparable net sales is now low-single-digit (1 to 3%). This target was previously 3 to 4%. Our long-term annual growth
targets continue to be mid-single-digit (4 to 6%) for comparable operating profit, and high-single-digit (7 to 9%) for currency-neutral comparable diluted net earnings per share.

During 2013, we announced Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program. The program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings, once all phases are approved and implemented, that will be
invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. We expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow. See the Restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more
information.

Comparability

Comparability of certain financial measures is impacted significantly by several types of charges or benefits such as Pringles integration costs, pension and
commodity mark-to-market adjustments, Project K costs, differences in shipping days, and other costs impacting comparability. To provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our comparable operating performance, we use non-GAAP
financial measures within MD&A that exclude the impact of these charges or benefits.

These non-GAAP financial measures include comparable net
sales, comparable gross margin, comparable gross profit, comparable SGA%, comparable operating margin, comparable operating profit, comparable income taxes, comparable effective tax rate, comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company,
comparable basic earnings per share (EPS), comparable diluted EPS, and comparable diluted EPS growth.

The currency-neutral comparable EPS and
currency-neutral comparable EPS growth non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, in addition to Pringles integration costs, pension and commodity mark-to-market adjustments, Project K costs, differences in
shipping days, and other costs impacting comparability.

The comparable net sales growth and comparable operating profit growth non-GAAP financial
measures exclude the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, in addition to foreign currency translation, Pringles integration costs, pension and commodity mark-to-market adjustments, Project K costs, differences in shipping days, and other costs
impacting comparability.

Financial results

For the full year 2014, our reported net sales decreased by 1.4% and comparable net sales decreased by 2.0%. We experienced comparable net sales declines in our developed cereal businesses and our U.S. Snacks
business. Comparable net sales grew in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Reported operating profit declined by 63.9% and comparable operating profit declined by 3.9%. The decline in comparable operating profit was driven by reduced sales, lower
production volume and higher distribution costs. This was partially offset by discipline in overhead control and reduced incentive compensation to align with performance.

Reported diluted EPS of $1.75 was down 64.6% compared to the prior year of $4.94. Comparable diluted EPS of $3.81 was down 1.0% compared to the prior year of $3.85 and was in line with our expectations.


Reconciliation of certain non-GAAP Financial Measures

(a)

Includes impact of integration costs associated with the Pringles acquisition.

(b)

Includes mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans and commodity contracts as reflected in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense. Actuarial
gains/losses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur. A portion of these mark-to-market adjustments were capitalized as inventoriable cost at the end of 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The amounts capitalized at the end of 2013, 2012 and
2011 have been recognized in the first quarter of 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Mark-to-market adjustments for commodities reflect the changes in the fair value of contracts for the difference between contract and market prices for the
underlying commodities. The resulting gains/losses are recognized in the quarter they occur.

(c)

Costs incurred related primarily to execution of Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program. The focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses
in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of value-added innovation. The program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the
implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories. Prior periods presented have been recast to exclude all restructuring and cost reduction activities from comparable results. Previously, only costs associated with
Project K were excluded from comparable results.

(d)

Difference in shipping days resulting from 53rd week of business results that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014.

(e)

Consists of costs related to evaluation of potential acquisitions.

(f)

Comparable net sales, comparable operating profit, comparable income taxes, comparable effective income tax rate, comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company, and
comparable EPS are non-GAAP measures which are reconciled to the directly comparable measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP within this table. We believe the use of such non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists in understanding
our comparable operating performance.

(g)

Comparable operating profit for the years ended January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 includes postretirement benefit plan income of $80 million and $12 million,
respectively. Comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company for the years ended January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 includes postretirement benefit plan income of $57 million and $9 million, respectively.

(h)

Mark-to-market adjustments, in general, were incurred in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than our reported effective tax rate. Costs incurred related to the execution of
Project K, in general, were incurred in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than our reported effective tax rate


Net sales and operating profit

2014 compared to 2013

Comparable net sales growth and comparable operating profit growth are non-GAAP measures which are reconciled to the directly comparable measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP
within this table. We believe the use of such non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists in understanding our comparable operating performance.


U.S. Morning Foods

Comparable net sales for U.S. Morning Foods declined 5.7% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. This segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.

The cereal category continued to decline through the year despite our continued investments behind category-building programs that started
early in the year. Much of our decline in the cereal category has come from

Special K

®

and

Kashi

®

. We experienced weakness in

Special K

®

as it faced headwinds from evolving consumer
trends regarding weight management. As a result, we changed the positioning of the brand from a focus on dieting to weight wellness. This focus will stress the role that

Special
K

®

plays in a healthy lifestyle. We have also identified areas of focus for

Kashi

®

which is a great brand in a category that is on trend. We have begun the execution of this new positioning for the overall cereal business through the
following initiatives:

•

We have launched the

See You at Breakfast

campaign and the

Open for Breakfast

digital program designed to help us connect directly with consumers

•

We are revitalizing the

Special K

®

brand and are launching new products
such as

Special K

®

Gluten-free and

Special K

®

Protein

•

All

Kashi Go-Lean

®

products will be Non GMO Project Verified

•

All

Kashi Heart-to-Heart

®

products will meet the USDA’s Organic
standard

We expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the

Special K

®

and

Kashi

®

brands, and on the cereal business as a whole. Our plan for investment
is long-term and the levels, content, and effectiveness of the support will evolve, and increase over time.

Toaster pastries reported a sales decline
for the year as a result of difficult comparisons due to the peanut butter innovations launched in 2013. However we did gain share for the year and introduced a new PB&J innovation in November and we expect this to improve sales results in 2015.
Health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline for the year.

Comparable operating profit in U.S. Morning Foods declined 10.8% due
to the unfavorable sales performance and a mid-single-digit increase in cereal brand-building investment. This was partially offset by a decrease in brand-building investment behind health and wellness bars and beverages, and continued cost
discipline.

U.S. Snacks

Comparable net sales in U.S. Snacks declined 2.4% as a result of decreased volume partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. This segment consists of crackers,
cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.

Crackers posted a slight sales increase and gained share as a
result of the continued success of

Cheez-It

®

innovations and core products in the

Town
House

®

, and

Club

®

brands due to brand-building support and sales execution.

Cheez-It

®

,

Town House

®

, and

Club

®

all reported solid consumption and share gains. The gains in these three brands have been offset by weakness in

Special K

®

Cracker Chips due to similar consumer trends that we have experienced in the cereal category. We have addressed this weakness by launching completely restaged Cracker
Chips with new flavors, better flavor and texture profiles, improved packaging, and new positioning. This new product started to arrive in stores in late December.

The bars business declined due to weakness in the

Special K

®

and

Fiber Plus

®

brands. The issues with these brands are similar to what we have experienced in the cereal category. To address these issues we launched new products and activities in
the fourth quarter of this year and will launch more new, great-tasting

Special K

®

snack bars with new packaging and new positioning. This activity ties into the
initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world. This new product started to arrive in stores in late December.

Rice Krispies Treats

®

and

Nutri-grain

®

both reported consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation. We expect this segment to remain challenging into
the first half of 2015.

The cookies business declined resulting in lost share. However we saw share gains from

Chips Deluxe

®

as a result of new co-branded products. We experienced soft performance in our 100-calorie packs business throughout the year. We are migrating consumers to an expanded
line of single-serve products, which should help to reduce the impact of the decline in 2015. We also experienced the negative impact of a SKU rationalization initiative with impacts expected to continue into early 2015.

Savory snacks reported mid-single-digit sales growth and held share for the year behind the performance of the core business, Grab ‘n Go,
and the new

Pringles

®

Tortilla product.

Comparable operating
profit in U.S. Snacks declined by 8.7% due to unfavorable sales performance and net cost inflation. This was partially offset by continued cost discipline.


U.S. Specialty

Comparable net sales in U.S. Specialty declined 1.4% as a result of decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. Sales declines were the result of the negative impact of weather early in the year, supply issues
with a co-packer, and an inventory de-load as a customer shifted from warehouse to direct delivery.

Comparable operating profit in U.S. Specialty
declined by 1.3% due to the unfavorable sales performance. This was partially offset by cost discipline.

North America Other

Comparable net sales in North America Other (U.S. Frozen and Canada) declined 1.8% due to decreased volume and unfavorable
pricing/mix. The U.S. Frozen business reported a decline due to unfavorable comparisons early in the year resulting from strong prior-year growth behind innovation activity and costs later in the year associated with the launch of new products. New

Eggo

®

Bites and

Eggo

®

handheld sandwiches performed well during the year. The
combination of the

Eggo

®

handheld sandwiches and good results from our

Special
K

®

handheld sandwiches resulted in a double-digit sales increase for our sandwich business during our final quarter of the year. Consumption of

Eggo

®

waffles is improving as we have re-launched the

L’Eggo My Eggo

®

brand-building
program and launched

Eggo

®

gluten-free and a new variety of

Thick-n-Fluffy

waffles. Canada reported a slight increase in sales driven primarily by the
snacks business as volumes increased at a low single-digit rate.

Comparable operating profit in North America Other declined 5.2% primarily due to
unfavorable sales performance. This was partially offset by continued cost discipline.

Europe

Comparable net sales for Europe declined 0.7% as a result of flat volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. Cereal category consumption remains soft
in most developed markets, similar to the cereal category in the U.S. Emerging markets reported good growth for the year in both cereal and snacks. To address the cereal category softness, we executed brand-building activities in the second half of
the year and we plan to launch new products and brand-building efforts in the first quarter of 2015. New

Special K

®

advertising has recently gone on air which
addresses the recent health and wellness trends that have negatively impacted this brand.

Savory snacks performed well throughout
the year, with the final quarter of 2014 reporting the highest sales since we acquired the business. New products are launching, including

Pringles

®

Tortilla, and
we have more capacity coming on-line mid-year.

Comparable operating profit in Europe improved 7.8% due to net cost deflation, including strong
productivity savings, and decreased brand-building investment. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales performance.

Latin
America

Latin America’s comparable net sales improved 3.9% due to favorable pricing/mix which was partially offset by decreased volume. Strong
price realization, primarily from Venezuela, has more than offset sales declines early in the year resulting from the volume elasticity impact of the introduction of a new food tax in Mexico. We reported growth in Venezuela, Mercosur, and the
Pringles business as well as pricing gains in a majority of our markets. The cereal business posted good results, although we saw some competitive price promotions in Mexico which affected selected segments. The momentum of the savory snacks
business continues, driven by strong commercial programs, innovation, and good execution.

Comparable operating profit in Latin America improved by 8.5%
due to favorable sales performance which was partially offset by net cost inflation, increased brand-building investment to support innovation and new programs, and increased overhead investment.

Asia Pacific

Comparable net sales in Asia
Pacific increased 0.7% as a result of flat volume and favorable pricing/mix. The sales increase was the result of double-digit growth in the Asian markets and high-single-digit growth in the savory snacks business across the region. This sales
performance was partially offset by weakness in the Australian cereal category and our performance in South Africa as we conducted construction work early in the year and it took longer than expected to bring the plant back on line.

Comparable operating profit in Asia Pacific declined 9.2% due to the weakness in the Australian cereal category and our performance in South Africa. This was
partially offset by cost discipline.

Corporate

Comparable operating profit for Corporate improved as a result of reduced pension costs which was partially offset by increased overhead investments.


2013 compared to 2012

The following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2013 versus 2012:

(a)

Impact of results for the year ended December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 from the acquisition of Pringles and the divestiture of Navigable Foods.

(b)

Includes impact of integration costs associated with the Pringles acquisition.

(c)

Includes mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans and commodity contracts as reflected in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense. Actuarial
gains/losses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur. A portion of these mark-to-market adjustments were capitalized as inventoriable cost at the end of 2013, 2012, and 2011. The amounts capitalized at the end of 2012 and 2011 have
been recognized in the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Mark-to-market adjustments for commodities reflect the changes in the fair value of contracts for the difference between contract and market prices for the underlying commodities.
The resulting gains/losses are recognized in the quarter they occur.

(d)

Costs incurred related primarily to execution of Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program. The focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses
in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of value-added innovation. The program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the
implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories. Prior periods presented have been recast to exclude all restructuring and cost reduction activities from comparable results. Previously, only costs associated with
Project K were excluded from comparable results.

(e)

Comparable net sales growth and comparable operating profit growth are non-GAAP measures which are reconciled to the directly comparable measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP
within this table. We believe the use of such non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists in understanding our comparable operating performance.

U.S. Morning Foods

Comparable net sales for U.S. Morning Foods declined 1.9% as a result of unfavorable volume and flat pricing/mix. This segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries,
health and wellness bars, and beverages. Cereal category growth was challenging throughout the year due to the timing of innovation, weakness in the adult segment of the portfolio and reduced retailer inventories. Despite this category performance,

Raisin

Bran

®

posted a solid consumption increase behind good innovation and advertising that resonated with consumers, and

Froot Loops

®

posted consumption growth as a result of innovation launched during the year. Toaster pastries reported solid growth behind innovations which resulted in consumption and
share gains for the year. Beverages continued to report increased consumption resulting from expanded distribution.


Comparable operating profit for U.S. Morning Foods declined due to increased commodity costs being partially offset by
overhead cost containment, reduced consumer promotion investment, and the favorable impact of lapping a 2012 product recall.

U.S.
Snacks

Comparable net sales in U.S. Snacks declined by 2.9% as a result of unfavorable volume which was partially offset by
favorable pricing/mix. This business consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks and fruit-flavored snacks. The sales decline was the result of lower shipments in crackers, cereal bars, cookies, and fruit-flavored snacks. Crackers
decline was the result of

Special K Cracker Chips

®

lapping a strong year-ago launch. This decline was partially offset with innovations by the

Cheez-it

®

and

Town House

®

brands. Sales declined in cereal bars across most brands. Cereal
bars reported gains in

Nutri-Grain

®

and

Rice KrispiesTreats

®

where we
invested behind innovations. Cookies sales declined for the year. This was partially driven by reductions in retailer inventories and strong competitor actions resulting in weakness across many of our brands. Savory snacks reported a solid sales
increase for the year as

Pringles

®

consumption gains continued throughout the year.

Comparable operating profit for U.S. Snacks declined due to significantly increased commodity costs, being partially offset by reduced advertising investment, reduced consumer promotion investment, and overhead
cost containment.

U.S. Specialty

Comparable net sales in U.S. Specialty increased by 4.1% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and volume. Sales growth was due to strong results from innovation
launches, expanded points of distribution, and pricing.

Comparable operating profit for U.S. Specialty increased due to favorable pricing, flat
commodity costs, and reduced advertising investment.

North America Other

Comparable net sales in North America Other (U.S. Frozen and Canada) increased by 2.2% due to favorable pricing/mix and volume. Sales growth was the result of our
U.S. Frozen business posting solid growth for the year while gaining share as a result of increased brand-building support behind innovation activity.

Comparable operating profit for North America Other increased due to favorable pricing and overhead cost containment which was partially offset by slight increases
in commodity costs and increased brand-building investment.

Europe

Comparable net sales in Europe increased 1.7% for the year driven by increased volume and favorable pricing/mix. Competitive conditions in
Europe remained challenging. The cereal category in the UK continued to be difficult, although new

Crunchy Nut

®

granola contributed to sales and

Crunchy Nut

®

, Rice Krispies

®

, and Corn Flakes

®

all gained share. We also posted sales growth in the Mediterranean/Middle East businesses and in Russia and were pleased with results in these developing growth regions.

Comparable operating profit in Europe improved due to reduced investment in consumer promotions and advertising along with overhead cost containment.
These benefits were partially offset by increased commodity costs.

Latin America

Comparable net sales in Latin America increased 5.5% due to a strong increase in pricing/mix partially offset by a decline in volume. Latin
America experienced growth in both cereal and snacks. Cereal performed very well in Venezuela and Brazil. The Snacks business growth was primarily the result of strong results from our

Pringles

®

brand.

Comparable operating profit in Latin America’s comparable
operating profit declined due to the impact of a supply disruption in our Venezuela business due to the difficult operating environment and increased overhead investment. This was partially offset by favorable price realization and reduced
advertising investment.

Asia Pacific

Comparable net sales in Asia Pacific grew 3.0% as a result of favorable volume partially offset by unfavorable pricing/mix. Asia Pacific’s growth was driven by solid cereal performance in India, Southeast
Asia, and Japan. In addition, the snacks business reported strong performance behind the

Pringles

®

brand. The Australia business experienced declines in the cereal
business and gains in the snacks business.

Comparable operating profit in Asia Pacific declined due to unfavorable price realization and increased
overhead investment. This was partially offset by sales growth and reduced brand-building investment.

Corporate

Comparable operating profit for Corporate improved as a result of reduced pension costs incurred resulting from the combination of lower interest
cost and higher expected return on assets for the plans.


Margin performance

Margin performance was as follows:

(a)

Reported gross margin as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold.

(b)

Includes impact of integration costs associated with the Pringles acquisition.

(c)

Includes mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans and commodity contracts as reflected in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense. Actuarial
gains/losses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur. A portion of these mark-to-market adjustments were capitalized as inventoriable cost at the end of 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The amounts capitalized at the end of 2013, 2012 and
2011 have been recognized in the first quarter of 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Mark-to-market adjustments for commodities reflect the changes in the fair value of contracts for the difference between contract and market prices for the
underlying commodities. The resulting gains/losses are recognized in the quarter they occur.

(d)

Costs incurred related primarily to execution of Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program. The focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses
in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of value-added innovation. The program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the
implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories. Prior periods presented have been recast to exclude all restructuring and cost reduction activities from comparable results. Previously, only costs associated with
Project K were excluded from comparable results.

(e)

Difference in shipping days resulting from 53rd week of business results that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014.

(f)

Consists of costs related to evaluation of potential acquisitions.

(g)

Comparable gross margin, comparable SGA%, and comparable operating margin are non-GAAP measures which are reconciled to the directly comparable measure in accordance with U.S.
GAAP within this table. We believe the use of such non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists in understanding our comparable operating performance.

Comparable gross margin declined by 40 basis points in 2014 due to the impact of inflation, net of productivity savings, and lower production volume resulting from soft sales performance. Comparable SG&A%
improved by 20 basis points as a result of continued discipline in overhead control.

Comparable gross margin declined by 110 basis points in 2013 due
to the impact of inflation, net of productivity savings, lower operating leverage due to lower sales volume, and the impact of the lower margin structure of the Pringles business. Comparable SG&A% improved by 90 basis points as a result of
favorable overhead leverage and synergies resulting from the Pringles acquisition, as well as reduced investment in consumer promotions.

Our comparable
gross profit, comparable SGA, and comparable operating profit measures are reconciled to the directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures as follows:

(a)

Gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold.

(b)

Includes impact of integration costs associated with the Pringles acquisition.

(c)

Includes mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans and commodity contracts as reflected in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense.
Actuarial gains/losses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur. A portion of these mark-to-market adjustments were capitalized as inventoriable cost at the end of 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The amounts capitalized at the end of 2013,
2012 and 2011 have been


recognized in the first quarter of 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Mark-to-market adjustments for commodities reflect the changes in the fair value of contracts for the difference between
contract and market prices for the underlying commodities. The resulting gains/losses are recognized in the quarter they occur.

Comparable gross profit, comparable SGA, and comparable operating profit are non-GAAP measures which are reconciled to the directly comparable measures in accordance with U.S.
GAAP within this table. We believe the use of such non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists in understanding our comparable operating performance.

Restructuring and cost reduction activities

We view our continued spending on restructuring
and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long-term profit growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a
five-year period of completion. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.

Project K

The most recent and
largest program that is currently active is Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program announced in November 2013. The program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that will be invested in key strategic areas of
focus for the business. The Company expects that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow.

The focus of the program is to strengthen existing businesses in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of
value-added innovation. The program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories.

We currently anticipate that the program will result in total pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, of $1.2 to $1.4 billion, with
after-tax cash costs, including incremental capital expenditures, estimated to be $900 million to $1.1 billion. Cash expenditures, after tax and including incremental capital, of approximately $300 million have been incurred since inception of the
program. Total cash expenditures, as defined, are expected to be approximately $350 million in 2015 and the balance of $250 to $450 million thereafter. We currently expect the charges will consist of asset-related costs totaling $450 to $500 million
which will consist primarily of asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and other exit-related costs; employee-related costs totaling $425 to $475 million which will include severance, pension and other termination benefits; and other costs
totaling $325 to $425 million which will consist primarily of charges related to the design and implementation of global business capabilities. A significant portion of other costs are the result of the implementation of global business service
centers which are intended to simplify and standardize business support processes. The timing and costs of these projects may change over time.

We
expect annual cost savings generated from Project K will be approximately $425 to $475 million by 2018, with approximately two-thirds of the cost savings to be realized in cost of goods sold. We have realized approximately $80 million of
savings since the inception of the program and expect $90 to $100 million of savings in 2015, approximately two-thirds of which will come from cost of goods sold. Cost savings will be reinvested into the business through additional investments in
advertising, in-store execution, and in the design and quality of our products. We will also invest in production capacity in developing and emerging markets, and in global category teams.

As a result of Project K, we anticipate that capital spending will be impacted at least through the end of fiscal year 2015. Our current business model assumes capital spending to be approximately 3-4% of net sales
annually. Through the end of fiscal year 2015, capital spending is expected to be approximately 4-5% as a result of Project K activities.

Due to the
difference in timing between expected cash costs for the project and expected future cash savings, we anticipate funding the project through a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt.

We also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions. The
impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the comparable income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis.

We currently expect that total pre-tax charges related to Project K will impact reportable segments as


follows: U.S. Morning Foods (approximately 18%), U.S. Snacks (approximately 12%), U.S. Specialty (approximately 1%), North America Other (approximately 5%), Europe (approximately 13%), Latin
America (approximately 3%), Asia-Pacific (approximately 6%), and Corporate (approximately 42%). A majority of the costs impacting Corporate relate to additional initiatives to be approved and executed in the future. When these initiatives are fully
defined and approved, we will update estimated costs by reportable segment as needed.

Since inception of Project K, we have recognized charges of $506
million that have been attributed to the program. The charges comprised of $2 million as a reduction of revenue, $326 million being recorded in COGS and $178 million recorded in SGA. Total charges for Project K in 2015 are expected to be
approximately $400 to $450 million.

All Projects

During 2014, we recorded $298 million of charges associated with all cost reduction initiatives. The charges were comprised of $2 million being recorded as a reduction of revenue, $152 million being recorded in
COGS and $144 million recorded in SGA expense.

We recorded $250 million of costs in 2013 associated with all cost reduction initiatives. The charges
were comprised of $195 million being recorded in COGS and $55 million recorded in SGA expense.

During 2012, we recorded $56 million of costs
associated with other cost reduction initiatives. The charges were comprised of $43 million being recorded in COGS and $13 million recorded in SGA expense.

The tables below provide the details for the charges incurred during 2014, 2013 and 2012 and program costs to date for programs currently active as of January 3, 2015.

Employee related costs consisted of severance and pension charges. Asset impairments were recorded for fixed assets that were
determined to be impaired and were written down to their estimated fair value. See Note 12 for more information. Asset related costs consist primarily of accelerated depreciation. Other costs incurred consist primarily of third-party incremental
costs related to the development and implementation of global business capabilities.

At January 3, 2015 total exit cost reserves were $110
million, related to severance payments and other costs of which a substantial portion will be paid in 2015 and 2016. The following table provides details for exit cost reserves.

(a)

Employee related non-cash charges consist of pension curtailment benefit.

Foreign currency translation

The reporting currency for our financial statements is the
U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Venezuelan bolivar
fuerte, and Russian ruble. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the
value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our
results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial.


Interest expense

Annual interest expense is illustrated in the following table. The declines in both 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to refinancing of maturing long-term debt at lower interest rates and lower interest rates on
long-term debt which has effectively been converted to floating rate obligations through the use of interest rate swaps. Interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was (in millions), 2014-$8; 2013-$7; 2012-$9. We currently expect that
our 2015 gross interest expense will be approximately $215 to $225 million.

Income taxes

Our reported effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 22.6%, 30.4% and 27.4% respectively. Comparable effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were
28.2%, 28.4%, and 28.4%, respectively. The impact of discrete adjustments on the reported effective income tax rate was a reduction of 6 percentage points for 2014, less than 1 percentage point reduction for 2013, and a reduction of 3 percentage
points for 2012.

The 2014 effective income tax rate benefited from the mark-to-market loss recorded for our pension plans. The 2012 effective income
tax rate benefited from the elimination of a tax liability related to certain international earnings now considered indefinitely reinvested. Refer to Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates.
Additionally, the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and
provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.

We believe that our operating cash flows, together with
our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and
credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

As of January 3, 2015 and
December 28, 2013, we had $257 million and $255 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations. These amounts
include $68 million and $42 million at January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, respectively, subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries that
can be repatriated at any particular point in time.

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:

Operating activities

The principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.

Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 amounted to $1,793 million, a decrease of $14 million compared with 2013. The decrease compared to the prior
year is the result of the negative impact of Project K cash requirements totaling $256 million, partially offset by improved performance in core working capital, which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative of approximately
$210 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 amounted to $1,807 million, an increase of $49 million compared with 2012, reflecting improved performance in core and other working capital.

Our cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory, excluding inventoriable mark-to-market pension costs, and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade
payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 27 days and 30 days for 2014 and


2013, respectively. Core working capital in 2014 averaged 7.6% of net sales, compared to 7.8% in both 2013 and 2012. Core working capital in 2014 showed improvements in days of inventory on hand
(excluding inventoriable mark-to-market pension costs) and days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative, partially offset by higher trade receivables.

Our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $53 million, $48 million and $51 million, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The Pension Protection Act (PPA), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the United States. We believe that we
will not be required to make any contributions under PPA requirements until 2021 or beyond. Our projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset
performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA.

We currently project that we will make total U.S. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2015 of approximately $55 million. Actual 2015 contributions could be different from our current projections, as
influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or
higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.

We measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for
property additions. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our cash flow
metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows:

The increase in cash flow (as defined) in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to lower capital expenditures and improved core
working capital partially offset by the negative impact of Project K cash requirements. The decrease in cash flow in 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to higher capital expenditures.

Investing activities

Our net cash used in investing activities for 2014 amounted to $573
million, a decrease of $68 million compared with 2013 primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures.

Capital spending in 2014 included
investments in our supply chain infrastructure, and to support capacity requirements in certain markets and products, including India and Pringles.

Net
cash used in investing activities of $641 million in 2013 decreased by $2,604 million compared with 2012, due to the acquisition of Pringles in 2012.

Cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has decreased to 4.0% in 2014, from 4.3% in 2013, which was an increase from 3.8% in 2012.

Financing activities

Our net cash used by
financing activities was $1,063 million and $1,141 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,317 million for 2012. The use of cash in financing activities in 2014 and 2013 compared to the
providing of cash from financing activities in 2012, was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of Pringles.

Total debt was
$7.4 billion at both year-end 2014 and 2013.

In March 2014, we redeemed $150 million of our 4.00% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2020, $342 million of our
3.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2022 and $189 million of our 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2023. In connection with the debt redemption, we incurred $1 million of interest expense, offset by $8 million of accelerated gains on interest rate
hedges previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and incurred $5 million expense, recorded in Other Income, Expense (net), related to acceleration of fees on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer.

In May 2014, we issued

€

500 million of
seven-year 1.75% Euro Notes due 2021, using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings.

In May 2014, we issued Cdn. $300 million of three-year 2.05% Canadian Dollar Notes due 2017, using the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay our Cdn. $300 million, 2.10% Notes due May 2014 at maturity.

In February 2013, we issued $250 million of two-year floating-rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and $400 million of ten-year 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes,
resulting in


aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $645 million. The proceeds from these Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including, together with cash on hand, repayment of the
$750 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% U.S. Dollar Notes due March 2013.

In May 2012, we issued $350 million of three-year 1.125%
U.S. Dollar Notes, $400 million of five-year 1.75% U.S. Dollar Notes and $700 million of ten-year 3.125% U.S. Dollar Notes, resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $1.442 billion. The proceeds of these Notes were
used for general corporate purposes, including financing a portion of the acquisition of Pringles.

In May 2012, we issued Cdn. $300 million of two-year
2.10% fixed rate Canadian Dollar Notes, using the proceeds from these Notes for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of intercompany debt. This repayment resulted in cash available to be used for a portion of the acquisition of
Pringles.

In December 2012, we repaid $750 million five-year 5.125% U.S. Dollar Notes at maturity with commercial paper.

In April 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $2.5 billion during
2010 through 2012. Under this program, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares of common stock for $63 million during 2012.

In December
2012, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $300 million during 2013. In April 2013, the board of directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program
expiring in April 2014. In February 2014, the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in shares through December 2015. This authorization supersedes the April 2013 authorization and is intended to allow us to
repurchase shares for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs. During 2014, we purchased 11 million shares totaling $690 million. In May 2013, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR)
Agreement with a financial institution counterparty and paid $355 million for the purchase of shares during the term of the agreement which extended through August 2013. The total number of shares delivered upon settlement of the ASR was based upon
the volume weighted average price of the Company’s stock over the term of the agreement. Total shares purchased in 2013, including shares delivered under the ASR, amounted to approximately 9 million shares totaling $544 million.

We paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.90 per share in 2014, $1.80 per share in 2013 and $1.74 per share in 2012. Total cash paid for
dividends increased by 4.0% in 2014 and 5.0% in 2013. In February 2015, the board of directors declared a dividend of $.49 per common share, payable on March 18, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2015.

In February 2014, we entered into an unsecured Five-Year Credit Agreement to replace the existing unsecured Four-Year Credit Agreement, which would have expired in
March 2015. The Five-Year Credit Agreement allows us to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion.

Our long-term debt agreements contain
customary covenants that limit Kellogg Company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions. Some agreements also contain change in control provisions. However, they do not
contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future.
However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in February 2019. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to
use it.

We monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as
those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.

We are in compliance with all
covenants as of January 3, 2015. We continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs,
including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis.


OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

Off-balance sheet arrangements

As of
January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 3, 2015:

(a)

Includes interest payments on our long-term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps. Interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the LIBOR forward
rate curve as of January 3, 2015.

(b)

The total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling approximately $1 million over the periods presented above.

(c)

Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.

(d)

Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services.
The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year-end 2014, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to
incur. Therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts.

(e)

As of January 3, 2015, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $78 million, of which $9 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. We are not able
to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $69 million.

(f)

Other long-term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at year-end 2014 and consist principally of projected
commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. The table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit
plans through 2020 as follows: 2015-$55; 2016-$39; 2017-$40; 2018-$41; 2019-$41; 2020-$41.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Promotional expenditures

Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events,
feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of
these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of
similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments
represent approximately 0.3% of our company’s net sales. However, our company’s total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) are significant, so it is likely our results would be materially different
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Property

Long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Management evaluates several conditions, including, but not
limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a
current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For assets to be held and used, we project the expected
future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long-lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. If the cash flow analysis yields an


amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and
estimates we use in these analyses.

At January 3, 2015, we have property, plant and equipment of $3.8 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on
our balance sheet. Included in this amount are approximately $79 million of idle assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

We perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of
each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process. Our 2012 analysis excluded goodwill and other intangible assets related to the Pringles acquisition on May 31, 2012. To comply with the requirement that all goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment within one year of acquisition, intangible assets recognized as part of the Pringles acquisition were tested for impairment during the second quarter of 2013 in addition to the evaluation
during the fourth quarter of 2013.

Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting
unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. For the 2014 goodwill
impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples. Our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and earnings for companies
comparable to our reporting units. In the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value, we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows. Management believes the
assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units.

Similarly, impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily
on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with
rates used by market participants. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.

We also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows.
Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances,
legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

At January 3, 2015, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $7.3 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001
acquisition of Keebler Foods Company and the 2012 acquisition of Pringles. Within this total, approximately $2.2 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, comprised principally of Keebler and Pringles trademarks.
We currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows. The percentage of excess fair value over
carrying value of the U.S. Snacks reporting unit was approximately 59% and 57% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. However, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future
performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses. Additionally, we have $33 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of United Bakers in Russia. The
percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the Russian reporting unit was approximately 35% in 2014 and 2013. If we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and EBITDA in the valuation, this could have resulted in an
impairment loss. For example, if our projection of EBITDA margins had been lower by 400 basis points, this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the Russian reporting unit. Management will continue to
monitor the situation closely.

Retirement benefits

Our company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding
strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We
recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to


use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment
and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, the mortality table and improvement scale, and the
interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

Our expense
recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our
measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.

Additionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of
plan assets.

To conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon
with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including consideration of
current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 69% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long-term
inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment
performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor
of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2015 of 8.5% equates to approximately the 57th percentile expectation of
our model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 31% of our global benefit plan assets.

Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at January 3, 2015, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly
increase or decrease 2015 benefits expense by approximately $60 million. For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions):
2014-$(41); 2013-$545; 2012–$211.

To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a
five-year historical period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that
would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short-term
future trends. In comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 4.71%, our initial trend rate for 2015 of 5.00% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing claims experience for certain
demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 0.25% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the
current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at January 3, 2015, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would
increase 2015 benefits expense by approximately $15 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of $169 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2015 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would
result in an experience loss of approximately $9 million and would increase 2015 expense by $0.4 million. Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. The experience gain
arising from recognition of 2014 claims experience was approximately $20 million.

Assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical
estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. On October 27, 2014, the Society of Actuaries’ (SOA) published updated mortality tables and an updated
improvement scale, which both reflect improved longevity. In determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of January 3, 2015, we considered the SOA’s updated mortality tables as well as other mortality information available from
the Social Security Administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates. The change to the mortality assumption increased the year-end pension and postretirement benefit obligations by $126 million and $33
million, respectively.


To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis
using Towers Watson’s proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of
the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to
90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. The measurement dates for our defined benefit
plans are consistent with our fiscal year end. Accordingly, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year.

Based on consolidated obligations at January 3, 2015, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2015 benefits expense by
approximately $3 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $263 million. All obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.

Despite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and
actual experience. During 2014, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $918 million compared to a net actuarial gain of approximately $1,097 million in 2013. Of the total net loss recognized in 2014, approximately $911 million was
related primarily to unfavorable changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions, $41 million was related to asset losses and $(34) million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs. Of the
$1,097 million net gain recognized in 2013, approximately $552 million was related to favorable changes in the discount rate, and $545 million of asset gains.

During 2014, we made contributions in the amount of $37 million to Kellogg’s global tax-qualified pension programs. This amount was mostly non-discretionary. Additionally we contributed $16 million
to our retiree medical programs.

Income taxes

Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The calculation of our income tax provision and deferred
income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. Income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the United States.

We recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon
examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate settlement. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. The tax position
will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. Significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of
Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from
contracts with customers. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity would be required to apply the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine
the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method, recognizing the cumulative effect of the
ASU in retained earnings at the date of initial application. An entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the modified retrospective method, but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected
in the current reporting period by the application of the ASU as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the change, as well as reasons for significant changes. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2017. We are currently
evaluating the impact that implementing this


ASU will have on our financial statements and disclosures, as well as whether we will use the retrospective or modified retrospective method of adoption.

FUTURE OUTLOOK

We expect during 2015 that
Project K will enable us to begin to increase investment in certain businesses and the categories in which we compete. We expect comparable net sales growth to be approximately flat; comparable gross margin to be up slightly due to net cost
deflation; comparable operating profit to decline by 2 to 4 percent; and currency-neutral comparable EPS to be in a range from flat to down 2 percent.

As a result of 2014 incentive compensation being reduced to align with performance and the anticipated re-establishment of usual incentive compensation levels in
2015, we expect that increased incentive compensation will result in a 3%-4% headwind for full-year results in 2015.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. As a matter
of policy, we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments.

Foreign exchange risk

Our company is
exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third-party purchases, intercompany transactions, and when applicable, nonfunctional currency denominated third-party debt. Our company is also exposed to fluctuations in
the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to
U.S. dollars. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Venezuelan bolivar fuerte, and Russian ruble, and in the case of inter-subsidiary transactions, the
British pound versus the euro. We assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts, options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency
positions. Forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances.

The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year-end 2014 was $764 million, representing a settlement receivable of
$23 million. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year-end 2013 was $517 million, representing a settlement obligation of $1 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions,
translational exposure, or existing assets or liabilities, and mature within 18 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year-end exchange rates, the settlement receivable would have become a settlement obligation of $53 million at
year-end 2014 and the settlement obligation at year-end 2013 would have increased by approximately $52 million. These unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures.

Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation
of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced a 46.5% devaluation of the official CADIVI (now named CENCOEX) exchange rate from
4.3 bolivars to 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities (SITME), used between May 2010 and January 2013 to translate our Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to
U.S. dollars, was eliminated. Accordingly, in February 2013 we began using the CENCOEX exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars and in 2013, we recognized a $15 million charge as a result of
the devaluation of the CENCOEX exchange rate. The CENCOEX exchange is restricted to some raw materials, finished goods, and machinery for sectors considered as national priorities, which is primarily food and medicines.

In March, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced a new auction-based currency transaction program referred to as SICAD1. SICAD1 allows entities in specific
sectors to bid for U.S. dollars to be used for specified import transactions, with the minimum exchange rate to be offered being 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. As of January 3, 2015, the published SICAD1 rate offered was 12.0 bolivars to the
U.S. dollar and availability of U.S. dollars at either exchange rate continues to be limited.

In January, 2014, the Venezuelan government announced the
expansion of the SICAD1 auction program to prospective dividends and royalties and new profit margin controls. As our Venezuelan subsidiary declares dividends or pays royalties in the future, based on the availability of U.S. dollars exchanged under
the SICAD1 program, the realized


exchange losses on payments made in U.S. dollars would be recognized in earnings. On profit margin controls, we continue to ensure we are complying with the requirements.

In February 2014, the Venezuelan government announced plans to launch a third foreign exchange mechanism, known as SICAD2, which became operational on
March 24, 2014. SICAD2 relies on U.S. dollar cash and U.S. dollar denominated bonds offered by the Venezuelan Central Bank, PDVSA (the national oil and gas company) and private companies. The Venezuelan government has allowed that all industry
sectors will be able to access SICAD2 and indicated that its use will not be restricted as to purpose. As of January 3, 2015, the published SICAD2 rate was 51.0 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.

In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced plans to launch a new foreign exchange mechanism, known as SIMADI, which is expected to become operational in
2015. The SIMADI exchange mechanism, which will replace SICAD2, has been reported to be an open market in which rates will be determined based on supply and demand.

In light of the current difficult macroeconomic environment in Venezuela, we continue to monitor and actively manage our investment and exposures in Venezuela. Our Venezuelan business does not rely heavily on
imports and when items are imported, they are largely exchanged at the CENCOEX rate. As of January 3, 2015 we translated our Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars using the CENCOEX exchange rate. We will continue to
monitor local conditions, our continued ability to obtain U.S. dollars at the CENCOEX exchange rate, and the use, if applicable, of the SICAD1, SICAD2 or SIMADI, once operational, mechanisms to determine the appropriate rate for translation. For
fiscal year 2014, Venezuela represented approximately 2% of total net sales and 3% of total comparable operating profit. As of January 3, 2015, our net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar were approximately $100 million in
U.S. dollars applying the CENCOEX exchange rate. If the CENCOEX exchange rate were to devalue further or if the currently less favorable SICAD1 exchange rate were extended to apply to a greater portion of our net monetary assets in Venezuela, we
would recognize a devaluation charge in earnings. The potential unfavorable fully diluted EPS impact of adopting the SICAD1 exchange rate, at the current rate of 12.0 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, would be approximately $.12 for the revaluation of
our net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar at January 3, 2015 and approximately $.06 for the translation of forecasted after-tax operating profit during 2015. The potential unfavorable fully diluted EPS impact of adopting the
SICAD2 exchange rate, at the current rate of 51.0 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, would be approximately $.21 for the revaluation of our net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar at January 3, 2015 and approximately $.12 for the
translation of forecasted after-tax operating profit during 2015. We continue to monitor the currency developments in Venezuela and take protective measures against currency devaluation which may include converting monetary assets into non-monetary
assets which we can use in our business.

Interest rate risk

Our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposures include movements in
U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain
debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions.

In 2014 and
prior years we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain U.S. Dollar Notes. Refer to disclosures contained in Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2014, we entered into forward starting
interest swaps with notional amounts totaling

€

500 million (approximately $600 million USD as of January 3, 2015), as a hedge
against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt to be used for general corporate purposes. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges.

The total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year-end 2014 was $3 billion, representing a settlement obligation of $12 million. The total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year-end 2013 was
$2.4 billion, representing a settlement obligation of $59 million. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately
$36 million at year-end 2014 and $35 million at year-end 2013.

Price risk

Our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials, fuel, and energy. Primary exposures
include corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar, cocoa, cartonboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We have historically used the combination of long-term contracts with suppliers, and exchange-traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations
in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months. During 2006, we entered into two separate 10-year over-the-counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of
natural gas used principally in our manufacturing


processes. The notional amount of the swaps totaled $42 million as of January 3, 2015 and equates to approximately 50% of our North America manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge
period. At year-end December 28, 2013 the notional amount was $63 million.

The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at
year-end 2014, including the North America natural gas swaps, was $492 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $56 million. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year-end 2013, including
the natural gas swaps, was $361 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $32 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year-end commodity prices, the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately
$31 million at year-end 2014, and $18 million at year-end 2013, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.

In addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above, we use long-term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials,
including rice, sugar, cartonboard, and corrugated boxes. It should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company.

Reciprocal collateralization agreements

In
some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or
letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount. As of January 3, 2015, we had no collateral posting requirements related to reciprocal collateralization agreements. As of December 28,
2013, we had posted collateral of $9 million in the form of cash, which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of January 3, 2015, and December 28, 2013, we posted $50 million and $12
million, respectively, in margin deposits for exchange-traded commodity derivative instruments, which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 1

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Kellogg Company, those of the subsidiaries that it controls due to ownership of a majority voting interest and the accounts of the variable interest entities (VIEs) of which Kellogg Company is the
primary beneficiary (Kellogg or the Company). The Company continually evaluates its involvement with VIEs to determine whether it has variable interests and is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. When these criteria are met, the Company is required
to consolidate the VIE. The Company’s share of earnings or losses of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in its consolidated operating results using the equity method of accounting when it is able to exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial decisions of the affiliate. The Company uses the cost method of accounting if it is not able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the affiliate. Intercompany balances and
transactions are eliminated.

The Company’s fiscal year normally ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and as a
result, a 53rd week is added approximately every sixth year. The Company’s 2013 and 2012 fiscal years each contained 52 weeks and ended on December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, respectively. The Company’s 2014 fiscal
year ended on January 3, 2015, and included a 53

rd

week. While quarters
normally consist of 13-week periods, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 included a 14

th

week.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents

Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.

Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable
consists principally of trade receivables, which are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and prompt payment discounts. Trade receivables do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents
management’s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable, as determined from a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when
management determines the receivable is uncollectible. The Company does not have off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on an
average cost basis.

Property

The Company’s property consists mainly of plants and equipment used for manufacturing activities. These assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over
estimated useful lives using straight-line methods for financial reporting and accelerated methods, where permitted, for tax reporting. Major property categories are depreciated over various periods as follows (in years): manufacturing machinery and
equipment 5-30; office equipment 4-5; computer equipment and capitalized software 3-7; building components 15-25; building structures 50. Cost includes interest associated with significant capital projects. Plant and equipment are reviewed for
impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions include an extended period of idleness or a plan of disposal. Assets to be disposed of at a future date are depreciated over the remaining period of
use. Assets to be sold are written down to realizable value at the time the assets are being actively marketed for sale and a sale is expected to occur within one year. As of year-end 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of assets held for sale was
insignificant.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be
impaired. An intangible asset with a finite life is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.

For the goodwill impairment
test, the fair value of the reporting units are estimated based on market multiples. This approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and earnings for companies that are comparable to the
Company’s reporting units. In the event the fair value determined using the market


multiple approach is close to carrying value, the Company may supplement the fair value determination using discounted cash flows. The assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with
those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for the Company’s reporting units.

Similarly, impairment testing of other
intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance,
cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales, discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants.

These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.

Accounts payable

Beginning in
2014, the Company has an agreement with a third party to provide an accounts payable tracking system which facilitates participating suppliers’ ability to monitor and, if elected, sell to designated third-party financial institutions, payment
obligations of the Company. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to sell one or more payment obligations of the Company prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial
institutions. The Company’s goal in entering into this agreement is to capture overall supplier savings, in the form of pricing, payment terms or vendor funding, created by facilitating suppliers’ ability to sell receivables, while
providing them with greater working capital flexibility. We have no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers’ receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services. The Company’s
obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under this arrangement. However, the Company’s right to offset balances due from suppliers
against payment obligations is restricted by this agreement for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers. As of January 3, 2015, $236 million of the Company’s outstanding payment obligations had been placed in the
accounts payable tracking system, and participating suppliers had sold $184 million of those payment obligations to participating financial institutions.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes sales upon delivery of its products to customers.
Revenue, which includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer, is reported net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, and various government withholding taxes. Methodologies for determining these provisions are
dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based
on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance.

Advertising and
promotion

The Company expenses production costs of advertising the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense is classified in
selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense.

The Company classifies promotional payments to its customers, the cost of consumer coupons, and
other cash redemption offers in net sales. The cost of promotional package inserts is recorded in cost of goods sold (COGS). Other types of consumer promotional expenditures are recorded in SGA expense.

Research and development

The costs of
research and development (R&D) are expensed as incurred and are classified in SGA expense. R&D includes expenditures for new product and process innovation, as well as significant technological improvements to existing products and
processes. The Company’s R&D expenditures primarily consist of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to time spent on R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and
equipment, including assets at manufacturing locations that are temporarily engaged in pilot plant activities.

Stock-based
compensation

The Company uses stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and executive performance
shares, to provide long-term performance incentives for its global workforce.

The Company classifies pre-tax stock compensation expense principally in
SGA expense within its corporate operations. Expense attributable to awards of equity instruments is recorded in capital in excess of par value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Certain of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, disability, or death of eligible employees and directors. A stock-based award is
considered vested for expense attribution purposes when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service.


Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility
is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.

The Company recognizes compensation cost for stock option awards that have a graded vesting
schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Corporate income tax benefits realized upon exercise or
vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (“windfall tax benefit”) is recorded in other financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to capital
in excess of par value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then
charged directly to income tax expense. The Company currently has sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb arising shortfalls, such that earnings were not affected during the periods presented. Correspondingly, the Company includes the
impact of pro forma deferred tax assets (i.e., the “as if” windfall or shortfall) for purposes of determining assumed proceeds in the treasury stock calculation of diluted earnings per share.

Income taxes

The Company recognizes
uncertain tax positions based on a benefit recognition model. Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of
being ultimately realized upon settlement. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. The Company classifies income tax-related interest and penalties as interest expense and SGA expense,
respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The current portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits is presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current assets and other current liabilities, and the amounts expected
to be settled after one year are recorded in other assets and other liabilities.

Income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is
expected to be remitted to and taxable in the United States.

Derivative Instruments

The fair value of derivative instruments is recorded in other current assets, other assets, other current liabilities or other liabilities. Gains and losses
representing either hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or hedges of translational exposure are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in other income (expense), net (OIE). In the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, settlements of cash flow and fair value hedges are classified as an operating activity; settlements of all other derivative instruments, including instruments for which hedge accounting has been discontinued,
are classified consistent with the nature of the instrument.

Cash flow
hedges.

Qualifying derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges when the hedged item is a forecasted transaction. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is realized, gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) to the Consolidated Statement of Income on
the same line item as the underlying transaction.

Fair value hedges.

Qualifying derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in earnings,
offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item.

Net investment hedges.

Qualifying derivative and nonderivative financial instruments are accounted for as net investment hedges when the hedged item is a nonfunctional currency investment in a subsidiary. Gains and losses on
these instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in AOCI.

Derivatives not designated for hedge accounting.

Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, on the same line item as the underlying hedged item.

Other contracts.

The Company
periodically enters into foreign currency forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in OIE, generally reducing the exposure
to translation volatility during a full-year period.

Foreign currency exchange
risk.

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third-party purchases, intercompany transactions and when applicable, nonfunctional
currency denominated third-party debt. The Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, the Company is exposed to
volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to U.S. dollars. Management assesses foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts, options, and
currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions.


Forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issues.

For foreign currency cash flow and fair value hedges, the assessment of effectiveness is generally based on changes in spot rates. Changes in time value are
reported in OIE.

Interest rate risk.

The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt. The Company periodically uses interest rate
swaps, including forward-starting swaps, to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market
conditions.

Fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and the assessment of effectiveness is based on changes in the
fair value of the underlying debt, using incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities.

Price risk.

The Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging
materials, fuel, and energy. The Company has historically used the combination of long-term contracts with suppliers, and exchange-traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material
purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months.

Certain commodity contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, while others are marked
to market through earnings. The assessment of effectiveness for exchange-traded instruments is based on changes in futures prices. The assessment of effectiveness for over-the-counter transactions is based on changes in designated indices.

Pension benefits, nonpension postretirement and postemployment benefits

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees, as well as salary continuance, severance, and long-term disability to
former or inactive employees.

The recognition of benefit expense is based on actuarial assumptions, such as discount rate, long-term rate of
compensation increase, long-term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate, and is reported in COGS and SGA expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Postemployment benefits.

The Company recognizes an obligation for postemployment
benefit plans that vest or accumulate with service. Obligations associated with the Company’s postemployment benefit plans, which are unfunded, are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
All gains and losses are recognized over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.

Postemployment benefits that do not vest or
accumulate with service or benefits to employees in excess of those specified in the respective plans are expensed as incurred.

Pension and nonpension postretirement benefits.

The Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year
in which they occur. Experience gains and losses are recognized annually as of the measurement date, which is the Company’s fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles. The Company
uses the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets.

Reportable segments are allocated service cost and amortization of
prior service cost. All other components of pension and postretirement benefit expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets, and experience gains and losses are considered unallocated corporate costs and are not included in the
measure of reportable segment operating results. See Note 16 for more information on reportable segments.

Assumed mortality rates of plan participants
are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense recognized. On October 27, 2014, the Society of Actuaries’ (SOA) published updated mortality tables and an
updated improvement scale, which both reflect improved longevity. In determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of January 3, 2015, the Company considered the SOA’s updated mortality tables as well as other mortality information
available from the Social Security Administration to develop assumptions aligned with the Company’s expectation of future improvement rates.

Management reviews the Company’s expected long-term rates of return annually; however, the benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does
not, by itself, significantly influence this evaluation. The expected rates of return are generally not revised provided these rates fall between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by the
Company’s modeling process.

For defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, the Company records the net overfunded or underfunded position
as a pension asset or pension liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.


New accounting standards

Presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward
exists.

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) which provides guidance on financial statement presentation of
unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. This ASU is expected to eliminate diversity in practice resulting from lack of previously existing guidance. It applies to all
entities with unrecognized tax benefits that also have tax loss or tax credit carryforwards in the same tax jurisdiction as of the reporting date. The Company adopted the revised guidance in 2014 with no significant impact to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Reporting of amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income.

In February 2013, the FASB issued an updated accounting standard requiring entities to present information about reclassifications out of accumulated other
comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. The Company adopted the updated standard in 2013.

Indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing.

In July 2012, the FASB issued an ASU to allow entities the option to first
assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test. Under the updated standard an entity would not be required to perform the quantitative impairment test
unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The Company adopted the revised guidance in 2013, with no impact to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Accounting standards to be adopted in future periods

In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity would be required to apply the following
five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) recognize
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the option
to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method, recognizing the cumulative effect of the ASU in retained earnings at the date of initial application. An entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the
modified retrospective method, but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by the application of the ASU as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the
change, as well as reasons for significant changes. The Company will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that implementing this ASU will have on its financial statements and
disclosures, as well as whether it will use the retrospective or modified retrospective method of adoption.

purchase price adjustments, which resulted in a reduction of the purchase price by approximately $15 million to $2.668 billion net of cash and cash equivalents. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method and was financed through a
combination of cash on hand, and short-term and long-term debt. The assets and liabilities of Pringles are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 and the results of the Pringles operations
subsequent to the acquisition date are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The final acquired assets and assumed liabilities include the
following:

Goodwill of $645 million is expected to be deductible for statutory tax purposes.


Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets recognized. The
goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition primarily reflects the value of providing an established platform to leverage the Company’s existing brands in the international snacks category, synergies expected to arise from the combined brand
portfolios, as well as any intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.

For the years ended January 3, 2015 and
December 28, 2013, the Company incurred integration-related costs as part of the Pringles acquisition as follows: $20 million ($46 million in 2013) recorded in SGA, $22 million ($15 million in 2013) recorded in COGS and $1 million ($5 million
in 2013) in net sales. Transaction fees and other integration-related costs incurred through December 29, 2012 were as follows: $73 million recorded in SGA, $3 million recorded in COGS and $5 million in fees for a bridge financing facility
which are recorded in OIE.

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are
presented in the following table.

The currently estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five succeeding fiscal periods is approximately $9 million per year.


NOTE 3

RESTRUCTURING AND COST REDUCTION ACTIVITIES

The Company views its continued spending on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of its ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility
in achieving its long-term profit growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five-year period of completion. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of
multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.

Project K

The most recent and largest program that is currently active is Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program announced in November 2013. The program
is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that will be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. The Company expects that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash
flow.

The focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive
an increased level of value-added innovation. The program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories.

The Company currently anticipates that the program will result in total pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, of $1.2 to $1.4
billion, with after-tax cash costs, including incremental capital expenditures, estimated to be $900 million to $1.1 billion. The Company currently expects the charges will consist of asset-related costs totaling $450 to $500 million which will
consist primarily of asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and other exit-related costs; employee-related costs totaling $425 to $475 million which will include severance, pension and other termination benefits; and other costs totaling $325
to $425 million which will consist primarily of charges related to the design and implementation of global business capabilities. A significant portion of other costs are the result of the implementation of global business service centers which are
intended to simplify and standardize business support processes.

The Company currently expects that total pre-tax charges related to Project K will
impact reportable segments as follows: U.S. Morning Foods (approximately 18%), U.S. Snacks (approximately 12%), U.S. Specialty (approximately 1%), North America Other (approximately 5%), Europe (approximately 13%), Latin America (approximately 3%),
Asia-Pacific (approximately 6%), and Corporate (approximately 42%). A majority of the costs impacting Corporate relate to additional initiatives to be approved and executed in the future. When these initiatives are fully defined and approved, the
Company will update estimated costs by reportable segment as needed.

Since inception of Project K, the Company has recognized charges of $506 million
that have been attributed to the program. The charges were comprised of $2 million being recorded as a reduction of revenue, $326 million being recorded in COGS and $178 million recorded in SGA.

All Projects

During 2014, the Company
recorded $298 million of charges associated with all cost reduction initiatives. The charges were comprised of $2 million being recorded as a reduction of revenue, $152 million being recorded in COGS and $144 million recorded in SGA expense.

The Company recorded $250 million of costs in 2013 associated with cost reduction initiatives. The charges were comprised of $195 million being
recorded in COGS and $55 million recorded in SGA expense.

During 2012, the Company recorded $56 million of costs associated with cost reduction
initiatives. The charges were comprised of $43 million being recorded in COGS and $13 million recorded in SGA expense.


The tables below provide the details for the charges incurred during 2014, 2013 and 2012 and program costs to date for
all programs currently active as of January 3, 2015.

Employee related costs consisted of severance and pension charges. Asset impairments were recorded for fixed assets that were
determined to be impaired and were written down to their estimated fair value. See Note 12 for more information. Asset related costs consist primarily of accelerated depreciation. Other costs incurred consist primarily of third-party incremental
costs related to the development and implementation of global business capabilities.

At January 3, 2015 total exit cost reserves were $110 million, related to severance payments and other costs of which a substantial portion will be paid in
2015 and 2016. The following table provides details for exit cost reserves.

(a)

Employee related non-cash charges consist of pension curtailment benefit.

EQUITY

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing net income attributable to Kellogg Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is similarly determined, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Dilutive
potential common shares consist principally of employee stock options issued by the Company, and to a lesser extent, certain contingently issuable performance shares. Basic earnings per share is reconciled to diluted earnings per share in the
following table:

The total number of anti-dilutive potential common shares excluded from the reconciliation for each period was (in millions):
2014-5.0; 2013-5.0;

2012-9.9.

Stock
transactions

The Company issues shares to employees and directors under various equity-based compensation and stock purchase
programs, as further discussed in Note 7. The number of shares issued during the periods presented was (in millions): 2014–4; 2013–10; 2012–5. The Company issued shares totaling less than one million in each of the years
presented under

Kellogg Direct

TM

, a direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan for U.S. shareholders.

In December 2012, the Company’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $300 million during
2013. In April 2013, the Company’s board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion in shares through April 2014. In February 2014, the Company’s board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up
to $1.5 billion in shares through December 2015. This authorization supersedes the April 2013 authorization and is intended to allow the Company to repurchase shares for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit
programs. In May 2013, the Company entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) Agreement with a financial institution counterparty and paid $355 million for the repurchase of shares during the term of the Agreement which extended through
August 2013. During the second quarter of 2013, 4.9 million shares were initially delivered to the Company and accounted for as a reduction to Kellogg Company equity. The transaction was completed during the third quarter, at which time the
Company received 0.6 million additional shares. The total number of shares delivered upon settlement of the ASR was based upon the volume weighted average price of the Company’s stock over the term of the agreement.

During 2014, the Company repurchased 11 million shares of common stock for a total of $690 million. During 2013, the Company repurchased 9 million shares
of common stock for a total of $544 million. During 2012, the Company repurchased 1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $63 million.

Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income includes net income and all other changes in equity
during a period except those resulting from investments by or distributions to shareholders. Other comprehensive income for all years presented consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, fair value adjustments associated with cash flow
hedges and adjustments for net experience losses and prior service cost related to employee benefit plans.


Reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) for the year ended January 3, 2015 and
December 28, 2013, consisted of the following:

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 consisted of the following:

Noncontrolling interests

In December 2012, the Company entered into a series of agreements with a third party including a subordinated loan (VIE Loan) of $44 million which is convertible into approximately 85% of the equity of the entity
(VIE). Due to this convertible subordinated loan and other agreements, the Company determined that the entity is a variable interest entity and the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company has consolidated the financial
statements of the VIE in 2012 and treated the consolidation as a business acquisition within the U.S. Snacks reportable segment, which resulted in the following as of December 29, 2012: current assets, $14 million; property, $36 million;
amortizable intangibles and other non-current assets, $26 million; goodwill, $76 million; current liabilities, $2 million; notes payable and long-term debt, $39 million; non-current deferred tax liabilities, $8 million; and noncontrolling interests,
$59 million. During 2013, the purchase price allocation was completed resulting in increases to goodwill and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $12 million. The assets and liabilities of the VIE are included in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 and the results of the VIE’s operations are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013. The
Company evaluates the VIE Loan for collectability based on the actual and projected financial results of the VIE, the amount of senior collateralized borrowings of the VIE as well as other matters impacting the VIE’s operations. The Company has
determined that an allowance for credit losses is not necessary as of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013. If the Company used moderately different assumptions regarding the VIE’s financial results and other matters, the VIE Loan
would have an other than temporary impairment.

As of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, the VIE had property and equipment with a
carrying value of $32 million and $35 million, respectively, and notes payable and current and long-term debt of $19 million and $30 million, respectively. The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating the VIE do not represent
additional claims on the Company’s general assets. Conversely, general creditors would not have claims against the assets of the VIE.

NOTE 5

LEASES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

The Company’s leases are generally for equipment and warehouse space. Rent expense on all operating leases was (in millions): 2014-$183; 2013-$174; 2012-$174.
During 2014 and 2013, the Company entered into less than $1 million in capital lease agreements. In 2012, the Company entered into approximately $4 million in capital lease agreements to finance the purchase of equipment.


At January 3, 2015, future minimum annual lease commitments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases
were as follows:

The Company has provided various standard indemnifications in agreements to sell and purchase business assets and lease facilities
over the past several years, related primarily to pre-existing tax, environmental, and employee benefit obligations. Certain of these indemnifications are limited by agreement in either amount and/or term and others are unlimited. The Company has
also provided various “hold harmless” provisions within certain service type agreements. Because the Company is not currently aware of any actual exposures associated with these indemnifications, management is unable to estimate the
maximum potential future payments to be made. At January 3, 2015, the Company had not recorded any liability related to these indemnifications.

ability to obtain letters of credit in an aggregate stated amount up to $75 million and swingline loans in aggregate principal amounts up to $200 million in U.S. Dollars and $400 million in Euros. The agreement contains customary covenants and
warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens and a specified interest coverage ratio. If an event of default occurs, then, to the extent permitted, the administrative agent may terminate the commitments under the credit
facility, accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreement, and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lender’s letter of credit exposure plus interest.

NOTE 7

STOCK COMPENSATION

The Company uses various equity-based compensation programs to provide
long-term performance incentives for its global workforce. Currently, these incentives consist principally of stock options, and to a lesser extent, executive performance shares, restricted stock units and restricted stock grants. The Company also
sponsors a discounted stock purchase plan in the United States and matching-grant programs in several international locations. Additionally, the Company awards restricted stock to its outside directors. These awards are administered through several
plans, as described within this Note.

The 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2013 Plan), approved by shareholders in 2013, permits awards to employees and
officers in the form of incentive and non-qualified stock options, performance units, restricted stock or restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. The 2013 Plan, which replaced the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2009 Plan), authorizes
the issuance of a total of (a) 22 million shares; plus (b) the total number of shares remaining available for future grants under the 2009 Plan. The total number of shares remaining available for issuance under the 2013 Plan will be
reduced by two shares for each share issued pursuant to an award under the 2013 Plan other than a stock option or stock appreciation right, or potentially issuable pursuant to an outstanding award other than a stock option or stock appreciation
right, which will in each case reduce the total number of shares remaining by one share for each share issued. The 2013 Plan includes several limitations on awards or payments to individual participants. Options granted under the 2013 and 2009 Plans
generally vest over three years. At January 3, 2015, there were 20 million remaining authorized, but unissued, shares under the 2013 Plan.

The Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (2009 Director Plan) was approved by shareholders in 2009 and


allows each eligible non-employee director to receive shares of the Company’s common stock annually. The number of shares granted pursuant to each annual award will be determined by the
Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. The 2009 Director Plan, which replaced the 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (2000 Director Plan), reserves 500,000 shares for issuance, plus the total number of shares as to which
awards granted under the 2009 Director Plan or the 2000 Director Plans expire or are forfeited, terminated or settled in cash. Under both the 2009 and 2000 Director Plans, shares (other than stock options) are placed in the Kellogg Company Grantor
Trust for Non-Employee Directors (the Grantor Trust). Under the terms of the Grantor Trust, shares are available to a director only upon termination of service on the Board. Under the 2009 Director Plan, awards were as follows (number of shares):
2014-23,890; 2013-26,504; 2012-26,940.

The 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was approved by shareholders in 2002 and permits eligible employees to
purchase Company stock at a discounted price. This plan allows for a maximum of 2.5 million shares of Company stock to be issued at a purchase price equal to 95% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of the quarterly purchase
period. Total purchases through this plan for any employee are limited to a fair market value of $25,000 during any calendar year. At January 3, 2015, there were approximately 0.4 million remaining authorized, but unissued, shares under
this plan. Shares were purchased by employees under this plan as follows (approximate number of shares): 2014–75,000; 2013–85,000; 2012–107,000. Options granted to employees to purchase discounted stock under this plan are included in
the option activity tables within this note.

Additionally, an international subsidiary of the Company maintains a stock purchase plan for its
employees. Subject to limitations, employee contributions to this plan are matched 1:1 by the Company. Under this plan, shares were granted by the Company to match an equal number of shares purchased by employees as follows (approximate number of
shares): 2014–58,000; 2013–58,000; 2012–71,000.

stock-based awards in the periods presented are included in the following table. Tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting of stock-based awards generally represent the tax benefit of the difference between the exercise price and the strike
price of the option.

Cash used by the Company to settle equity instruments granted under stock-based awards was insignificant.

Shares used to satisfy stock-based awards are normally issued out of treasury stock, although management is authorized to issue new
shares to the extent permitted by respective plan provisions. Refer to Note 4 for information on shares issued during the periods presented to employees and directors under various long-term incentive plans and share repurchases under the
Company’s stock repurchase authorizations. The Company does not currently have a policy of repurchasing a specified number of shares issued under employee benefit programs during any particular time period.

Stock options

During the periods presented,
non-qualified stock options were granted to eligible employees under the 2013 and 2009 Plans with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the grant date, a contractual term of ten years, and a three-year graded
vesting period.

Management estimates the fair value of each annual stock option award on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation
model. Composite assumptions are presented in the following table. Weighted-average values are disclosed for certain inputs which incorporate a range of assumptions. Expected volatilities are based principally on historical volatility of the
Company’s stock, and to a lesser extent, on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s stock. Historical volatility corresponds to the contractual term of the options granted. The Company uses historical data to estimate
option exercise and employee termination within the valuation models; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted represents the
period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding; the weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the following table. The risk-


free rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

A summary of option activity for the year ended January 3, 2015 is presented in the following table:

Additionally, option activity for the comparable prior year periods is presented in the following table:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the periods presented was (in millions): 2014–$56; 2013–$139;
2012–$34.

Other stock-based awards

During the periods presented, other stock-based awards consisted principally of executive performance shares and restricted stock granted under the 2013 and 2009 Plans.

In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company made performance share awards to a limited number of senior executive-level employees, which entitles these employees to
receive a specified number of shares of the Company’s common stock on the vesting date, provided cumulative three-year targets are achieved. The cumulative three-year targets involved operating profit and comparable net sales growth. Management
estimates the fair value of performance share awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the performance period. The 2014, 2013 and 2012 target
grants (as revised for non-vested forfeitures and other adjustments) currently correspond to approximately 223,000, 194,000 and 178,000 shares, respectively, with a grant-date fair value of $54, $54, and $47 per share. The actual number of
shares issued on the vesting date could range from zero to 200% of target, depending on actual performance achieved. Based on the market price of the Company’s common stock at year-end 2014, the maximum future value that could be awarded on the
vesting date was (in millions): 2014 award–$29; 2013 award–$25; and 2012 award–$23. The 2011 performance share award, payable in stock, was settled at 60% of target in February 2014 for a total dollar equivalent of $3 million.

The Company also periodically grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to eligible employees under the 2013 Plan. Restrictions with respect
to sale or transferability generally lapse after three years and, in the case of restricted stock, the grantee is normally entitled to receive shareholder dividends during the vesting period. Management estimates the fair value of restricted stock
grants based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. A summary of restricted stock activity for the year ended January 3, 2015, is presented in the following table:

Grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units for comparable prior-year periods were: 2013 – 139,000,
2012–160,000.

The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vesting in the periods presented was (in millions):
2014–$4; 2013–$6; 2012–$4.


NOTE 8

PENSION BENEFITS

The Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign pension plans to
provide retirement benefits for its employees. The majority of these plans are funded or unfunded defined benefit plans, although the Company does participate in a limited number of multiemployer or other defined contribution plans for certain
employee groups. See Note 10 for more information regarding the Company’s participation in multiemployer plans. Defined benefits for salaried employees are generally based on salary and years of service, while union employee benefits are
generally a negotiated amount for each year of service.

Obligations and funded status

The aggregate change in projected benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status is presented in the following tables.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $5.1 billion and $4.5 billion at
January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, respectively. Information for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were:

Expense

The
components of pension expense are presented in the following table. Pension expense for defined contribution plans relates to certain foreign-based defined contribution plans and multiemployer plans in the United States in which the Company
participates on behalf of certain unionized workforces.

The estimated prior service cost for defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive
income into pension expense over the next fiscal year is approximately $12 million.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor 401(k) or
similar savings plans for active employees. Expense related to these plans was (in millions): 2014 – $43; 2013 – $41; 2012 – $39. These amounts are not included in the preceding expense table. Company contributions to these
savings plans approximate annual expense. Company contributions to multiemployer and other defined contribution pension plans approximate the amount of annual expense presented in the preceding table.

See discussion in Note 3 related to curtailment and special termination benefit costs recognized in 2014.

Assumptions

The worldwide weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit
obligations were:




Discount rate

3.9%

4.7%

4.0%

Long-term rate of compensation increase

4.0%

4.1%

4.1%


The worldwide weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine annual net periodic benefit cost were:




Discount rate

4.8%

Long-term rate of compensation increase

4.1%

4.1%

4.2%

Long-term rate of return on plan assets

8.5%

8.5%

8.9%

To determine the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company models expected returns over a 20-year
investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of its major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including
consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. The U.S. model, which corresponds to approximately 69% of consolidated pension and other postretirement
benefit plan assets, incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting
local economic conditions. The expected rate of return for 2014 of 8.5% equated to approximately the 57th percentile expectation. Refer to Note 1.

On October 27, 2014, the Society of Actuaries’ (SOA) published updated mortality tables and an updated improvement scale, which both reflect improved
longevity. In determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of January 3, 2015, the Company considered the SOA’s updated mortality tables as well as other mortality information available from the Social Security Administration to
develop assumptions aligned with the Company’s expectation of future improvement rates. The change to the mortality assumption increased the year-end pension and postretirement benefit obligations by $126 million and $33 million, respectively.

To conduct the annual review of discount rates, the Company selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using Towers
Watson’s proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the
estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th
percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. The measurement dates for the defined benefit plans
are consistent with the Company’s fiscal year end. Accordingly, the Company selected discount rates to measure the benefit obligations consistent with market indices at year-end.

Plan assets

The Company categorized Plan assets within a three level fair value hierarchy
described as follows:

Investments stated at fair value as determined by quoted market prices (Level 1) include:

Cash and cash equivalents:

Value
based on cost, which approximates fair value.

Corporate stock, common:

Value based on the last sales price on the primary exchange.

Investments stated at estimated fair value
using significant observable inputs (Level 2) include:

Cash and cash
equivalents:

Institutional short-term investment vehicles valued daily.

Mutual funds:

Valued at the net asset value of shares held by the Plan at year end.

Collective trusts

:  Value based on
the net asset value of units held at year end.

Bonds:

Value based on matrices or models from pricing vendors.

Limited partnerships:

Value based on the ending net capital account balance at year end.

Investments stated at estimated fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) include:

Real Estate:

Value based on the net asset value of units held at year end. The fair
value of real estate holdings is based on market data including earnings capitalization, discounted cash flow analysis, comparable sales transactions or a combination of these methods.

Bonds:

Value based on matrices or models from brokerage firms. A limited number of
the investments are in default.

The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value
or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.


The Company’s practice regarding the timing of transfers between levels is to measure transfers in at the
beginning of the month and transfers out at the end of the month. For the year ended January 3, 2015, the Company had no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.

The fair value of Plan assets as of January 3, 2015 summarized by level within the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

The fair value of Plan assets at December 28, 2013 are summarized as follows:

There were no unfunded commitments to purchase investments at January 3, 2015 or December 28, 2013.

The Company’s investment strategy for its major defined benefit plans is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of meeting
long-term cash requirements as they become due. Assets are invested in a prudent manner to maintain the security of funds while maximizing returns within the Plan’s investment policy. The investment policy specifies the type of investment
vehicles appropriate for the Plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for the selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager performance. It also provides guidelines enabling
Plan fiduciaries to fulfill their responsibilities.

The current weighted-average target asset allocation reflected by this strategy is: equity
securities–69%; debt securities–25%; other–6%. Investment in Company common stock represented 1.3% and 1.2% of consolidated plan assets at January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, respectively. Plan funding strategies are
influenced by tax regulations and funding requirements. The Company currently expects to contribute approximately $39 million to its defined benefit pension plans during 2014.

Level 3 gains and losses

Changes in the fair value of the Plan’s Level 3 assets are
summarized as follows:

The net change in Level 3 assets includes a gain attributable to the change in unrealized holding gains or losses related to Level
3 assets held at January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 totaling $23 million and $8 million, respectively.

Benefit payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid (in millions): 2015–$426;
2016–$267; 2017–$261; 2018–$269; 2019–$279; 2020 to 2024–$1,627.


NOTE 9

NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Postretirement

The Company sponsors a number of plans to provide health care and other welfare benefits to retired employees in the United States and Canada, who
have met certain age and service requirements. The majority of these plans are funded or unfunded defined benefit plans, although the Company does participate in a limited number of multiemployer or other defined contribution plans for certain
employee groups. The Company contributes to voluntary employee benefit association (VEBA) trusts to fund certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit obligations.

Obligations and funded status

The aggregate change in accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation, plan assets, and funded status is presented in the following tables.

Expense

Components of postretirement benefit expense (income) were:

The estimated prior service cost credit that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into nonpension
postretirement benefit expense over the next fiscal year is expected to be approximately $2 million.

See discussion in Note 3 regarding
curtailment expense recognized in 2014.

Assumptions

The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were:




Discount rate

4.0%

4.8%

3.9%

The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine annual net periodic benefit cost were:




Discount rate

4.8%

3.9%

4.6%

Long-term rate of return on plan assets

8.5%

8.5%

8.9%

The Company determines the overall discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on VEBA trust obligations and assets in the
same manner as that described for pension trusts in Note 8.

The assumed health care cost trend rate is 5.0% for 2015, decreasing gradually to 4.5%
by the year 2017 and remaining at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect the Company’s historical experience and management’s expectations regarding future trends. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend
rates would have the following effects:

The fair value of Plan assets as of January 3, 2015 summarized by level within fair value hierarchy described in Note 8, are as follows:

The fair value of Plan assets at December 28, 2013 are summarized as follows:

The Company’s asset investment strategy for its VEBA trusts is consistent with that described for its pension trusts in
Note 8. The current target asset allocation is 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities. The Company currently expects to contribute approximately $16 million to its VEBA trusts during 2015.

There were no Level 3 assets during 2014 and 2013.

Postemployment

Under certain conditions,
the Company provides benefits to former or inactive employees, including salary continuance, severance, and long-term disability, in the United States and several foreign locations. The Company’s postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.
Actuarial assumptions used are generally consistent with those presented for pension benefits in Note 8. The aggregate change in accumulated postemployment benefit obligation and the net amount recognized were:

Components of postemployment benefit expense were:

The estimated net experience loss and net prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income
into postemployment benefit expense over the next fiscal year is $3 million and $1 million, respectively.

Benefit payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:


NOTE 10

MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

The Company contributes to multiemployer
defined contribution pension and postretirement benefit plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain unionized employee groups in the United States. Contributions to these plans are included in total pension and
postretirement benefit expense as reported in Notes 8 and 9, respectively.

Pension benefits

The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from
single-employer plans. Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of
the plan are borne by the remaining participating employers.

The Company’s
participation in multiemployer pension plans for the year ended January 3, 2015, is outlined in the table below. The “EIN/PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN). The most
recent Pension Protection Act (PPA) zone status available for 2014 and 2013 is for the plan year-ends as indicated below. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary.
Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone are between 65 percent and 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. The “FIP/RP Status
Pending/Implemented” column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. In addition to regular plan contributions, the Company may be subject to a
surcharge if the plan is in the red zone. The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether a surcharge has been imposed on contributions to the plan. The last column lists the expiration date(s) of the collective-bargaining agreement(s)
(CBA) to which the plans are subject.

(a)

The Company is party to multiple CBAs requiring contributions to this fund, each with its own expiration date. Over 70 percent of the Company’s participants in this fund are
covered by a single CBA that expires on 4/30/2017.

(b)

The Company is party to multiple CBAs requiring contributions to this fund, each with its own expiration date. Over 40 percent of the Company’s participants in this fund are
covered by a single CBA that expires on 7/27/2017.

(c)

The Company is party to multiple CBAs requiring contributions to this fund, each with its own expiration date. Over 40 percent of the Company’s participants in this fund are
covered by a single CBA that expires on 3/24/2018.


The Company was listed in the Forms 5500 of the following plans as of the following plan year ends as providing more
than 5 percent of total contributions:

At the date the Company’s financial statements were issued, Forms 5500 were not available for the plan years ending on or
after June 30, 2014.

In addition to regular contributions, the Company could be obligated to pay additional amounts, known as a withdrawal
liability, if a multiemployer pension plan has unfunded vested benefits and the Company decreases or ceases participation in that plan. The Company has recognized net estimated withdrawal expense related to curtailment and special termination
benefits associated with the Company’s withdrawal from certain multiemployer plans aggregating (in millions): 2014 – $0; 2013 – $0; 2012 – $(5).

Postretirement benefits

Multiemployer postretirement benefit plans provide health care and
other welfare benefits to active and retired employees who have met certain age and service requirements. Contributions to multiemployer postretirement benefit plans were (in millions): 2014 – $14; 2013 – $13; 2012 – $13.

NOTE 11

INCOME
TAXES

The components of income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes were as follows:

The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and the Company’s effective income tax rate was:

As presented in the preceding table, the Company’s 2014 consolidated effective tax rate was 22.6%, as compared to 30.4% in
2013 and 27.4% in 2012.

The 2014 effective income tax rate benefited due to mark-to-market loss adjustments to the Company’s pension plans in
primarily higher tax jurisdictions. This results in a greater percentage of total income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions and permanent tax differences in the U.S. having a higher percentage impact on the tax rate. As of January 3,
2015, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $1 million related to $23 million of foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested. Accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $2.2 billion, primarily in Europe, were considered
indefinitely reinvested. Due to varying tax laws around the world


and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings because the actual tax liability, if any, would be
dependent on circumstances existing when a repatriation, sale or liquidation occurs.

The 2013 effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by
income generated from mark-to-market adjustments for the Company’s pension plans that was generally incurred in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the effective income tax rate. As of December 28, 2013, the Company recorded a
deferred tax liability of $2 million related to $24 million of foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested. Accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $2.2 billion, primarily in Europe and Mexico, were considered indefinitely
reinvested. Due to varying tax laws around the world and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings because the actual tax liability, if any, would be
dependent on circumstances existing when a repatriation, sale or liquidation occurs.

The 2012 effective income tax rate benefited from the elimination
of a tax liability related to certain international earnings now considered indefinitely reinvested. As of December 29, 2012, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $5 million related to $258 million of earnings. Accumulated foreign
earnings of approximately $1.7 billion, primarily in Europe, were considered indefinitely reinvested. Due to varying tax laws around the world and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred
tax liability on these earnings because the actual tax liability, if any, would be dependent on circumstances existing when a repatriation, sale or liquidation occurs.

Management monitors the Company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, prior to expiration. Changes resulting from management’s assessment will
result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate. Valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future. The
total tax benefit of carryforwards at year-end 2014 and 2013 were $54 million and $55 million, respectively, with related valuation allowances at year-end 2014 and 2013 of $39 million and $49 million, respectively. Of the total
carryforwards at year-end 2014, substantially all will expire after 2018.

The following table provides an analysis of the Company’s deferred tax
assets and liabilities as of year-end 2014 and 2013. Deferred tax assets on employee benefits increased in 2014 due to lower asset returns and discount rate decreases associated with the Company’s pension and postretirement plans.

The change in valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets was:

(a)

Reduction due to the disposition of a business resulting in deferred tax asset and valuation allowance being eliminated.

Cash paid for income taxes was (in millions): 2014 – $414; 2013 – $426; 2012 – $508. Income tax benefits realized from stock option exercises and
deductibility of other equity-based awards are presented in Note 7.


Uncertain tax positions

The Company is subject to federal income taxes in the U.S. as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s 2014 provision for U.S. federal income taxes represents approximately
60% of the Company’s consolidated income tax provision. The Company was chosen to participate in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Compliance Assurance Program (CAP) beginning with the 2008 tax year. As a result, with limited exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by the IRS for years prior to 2014. The Company is under examination for income and non-income tax filings in various state and foreign jurisdictions.

As of January 3, 2015, the Company has classified $9 million of unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability. Management’s estimate of
reasonably possible changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months is comprised of the current liability balance expected to be settled within one year, offset by approximately $9 million of projected additions related
primarily to ongoing intercompany transfer pricing activity. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant additional payments, accruals, or other material deviation in this estimate.

Following is a reconciliation of the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the years ended January 3, 2015, December 28, 2013
and December 29, 2012. For the 2014 year, approximately $56 million represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate in future periods.

For the year ended January 3, 2015, the Company recognized an increase of $3 million of tax-related interest and
penalties resulting in an accrual balance of $20 million at year end. For the year ended December 28, 2013, the Company recognized an increase of $4 million of tax-related interest and penalties and cash settlements of $6 million,
resulting in an accrual balance of $17 million at December 28, 2013. For the year ended December 29, 2012, the Company recognized an increase of $4 million of tax-related interest and penalties and had approximately $19 million
accrued at December 29, 2012.

NOTE 12

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company is exposed to certain market
risks such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices, which exist as a part of its ongoing business operations. Management uses derivative financial and commodity instruments, including futures, options, and
swaps, where appropriate, to manage these risks. Instruments used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.

The Company designates derivatives as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges, and uses other contracts to reduce volatility in interest rates,
foreign currency and commodities. As a matter of policy, the Company does not engage in trading or speculative hedging transactions.

Total notional
amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments as of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 were as follows:

Following is a description of each category in the fair value hierarchy and the financial assets and liabilities of the Company
that were included in each category at January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, measured on a recurring basis.

Level 1 —

Financial
assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. For the Company, level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of commodity derivative contracts.

Level 2 —

Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are
observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. For the Company, level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of interest rate swaps and over-the-counter commodity and currency contracts.

The Company’s calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the
contract and the interest rate curve. Over-the-counter commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Foreign


currency contracts are valued using an income approach based on forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The Company’s calculation of the fair value of level 2
financial assets and liabilities takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk.

Level 3 —

Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions
about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company did not have any level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of January 3, 2015 or December 28, 2013.

The following table presents assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a recurring basis as of January 3,
2015 and December 28, 2013:

Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:

(a)

The fair value of the related hedged portion of the Company’s long-term debt, a level 2 liability, was $2.5 billion as of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013.

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:

During 2014, the Company designated a portion of its outstanding foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a net investment
hedge of a portion of the Company’s investment in its subsidiaries foreign currency denominated net assets. The carrying value of this debt was $600 million as of January 3, 2015.

The Company has elected to not offset the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities executed with the same counterparty that are generally subject to enforceable netting agreements. However, if the Company
were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of derivatives on a net basis, the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 would be adjusted as detailed in the following
table:


The effect of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended January 3, 2015
and December 28, 2013 were as follows:

Derivatives in fair value hedging relationships

(a)

Includes the ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing.

Derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships

(a)

Includes the ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing.

Derivatives and non-derivatives in net investment hedging relationships

During the next 12 months, the Company expects $14 million of
net deferred gains reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) at January 3, 2015 to be reclassified to income, assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities.


Certain of the Company’s derivative instruments contain provisions requiring the Company to post collateral on
those derivative instruments that are in a liability position if the Company’s credit rating falls below BB+ (S&P), or Baa1 (Moody’s). The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a
liability position on January 3, 2015 was $26 million. If the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of January 3, 2015, the Company would be required to post additional collateral of $26 million. In addition, certain
derivative instruments contain provisions that would be triggered in the event the Company defaults on its debt agreements. There were no collateral posting requirements as of January 3, 2015 triggered by credit-risk-related contingent
features.

the usage of and disposing certain long-lived assets, including manufacturing facilities and Corporate owned assets over the term of the program. See Note 3 for more information regarding Project K.

During 2014, long-lived assets of $24 million, related to a manufacturing facility in the Company’s U.S. Snacks segment, were written down to an estimated
fair value of $3 million due to Project K activities. The Company’s calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on Level 3 inputs, including market comparables, market trends and the condition of the assets.

2013 Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis

During 2013, long-lived assets of $97 million, including manufacturing facilities in the Company’s U.S. Morning Foods and Asia Pacific reporting units and
certain Corporate owned assets, were written down to an estimated fair value of $31 million due to Project K. The Company’s calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on Level 3 inputs, including market comparables, market
trends and the condition of the assets.

During 2013, the Company recognized additional asset impairment charges totaling $4 million on a manufacturing
facility in Australia closed during 2012.

Counterparty credit risk concentration

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on derivative financial and commodity contracts. Management believes a concentration of credit risk with respect to derivative
counterparties is limited due to the credit ratings and use of master netting and reciprocal collateralization agreements with the counterparties and the use of exchange-traded commodity contracts.

Master netting agreements apply in situations where the Company executes multiple contracts with the same counterparty. If these counterparties fail to perform
according to the terms of derivative contracts, this could result in a loss to the Company. As of January 3, 2015, there were no counterparties that represented a significant concentration of credit risk to the Company.

For certain derivative contracts, reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury
securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the Company or its counterparties exceeds a certain amount. As of January 3, 2015, the Company had no collateral posting requirements related to reciprocal collateralization
agreements. As of January 3, 2015, the Company posted $50 million in margin deposits for exchange-traded commodity derivative instruments, which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable, net.

Management believes concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to


the generally high credit quality of the Company’s major customers, as well as the large number and geographic dispersion of smaller customers. However, the Company conducts a
disproportionate amount of business with a small number of large multinational grocery retailers, with the five largest accounts encompassing approximately 30% of consolidated trade receivables at January 3, 2015.

Refer to Note 1 for disclosures regarding the Company’s accounting policies for derivative instruments.

NOTE 13

CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to
various legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inspections or investigations in the ordinary course of business covering matters such as general commercial, governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability,
environmental, intellectual property, workers’ compensation, employment and other actions. These matters are subject to uncertainty and the outcome is not predictable with assurance. The Company uses a combination of insurance and
self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability and product liability.

The Company
has established accruals for certain matters where losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. There are other claims and legal proceedings pending against the Company for which accruals have not been established. It is reasonably possible
that some of these matters could result in an unfavorable judgment against the Company and could require payment of claims in amounts that cannot be estimated at January 3, 2015. Based upon current information, management does not expect any of
the claims or legal proceedings pending against the Company to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
connection with the Company’s on-going labor negotiations with the union representing the work-force at our Memphis, TN cereal production facility, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed a complaint alleging unfair labor practices
under the National Labor Relations Act in March 2014. In July 2014, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the Memphis employees were entitled to return to work while the underlying litigation continues and employees have subsequently returned to
work. In August 2014, an NLRB Administrative Law Judge dismissed the complaint that initiated the underlying litigation. The union and the NLRB have appealed that decision and the case continues. This litigation is not expected to have a material
effect on the production or distribution of products from the Memphis, TN facility or a material financial impact on the Company. As of January 3, 2015, the Company has not recorded a liability related to this matter as an adverse outcome
is not considered probable. The Company will continue to evaluate the likelihood of potential outcomes for this case as the litigation continues.

NOTE 14

VENEZUELA

Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of the Company’s 2010 fiscal year. Gains and losses resulting from the
translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced a 46.5% devaluation of the official CADIVI (now named CENCOEX)
exchange rate from 4.3 bolivars to 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities (SITME), used between May 2010 and January 2013 to translate the Company’s Venezuelan
subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars, was eliminated. Accordingly, in February 2013 the Company began using the CENCOEX exchange rate to translate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars
and in 2013, the Company recognized a $15 million charge as a result of the devaluation of the CENCOEX exchange rate. The CENCOEX exchange is restricted to some raw materials, finished goods, and machinery for sectors considered as national
priorities, which is primarily food and medicines.

In March, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced a new auction-based currency transaction program
referred to as SICAD1. SICAD1 allows entities in specific sectors to bid for U.S. dollars to be used for specified import transactions, with the minimum exchange rate to be offered being 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. As of January 3, 2015,
the published SICAD1 rate offered was 12.0 bolivars to the U.S. dollar and availability of U.S. dollars at either exchange rate continues to be limited.

In January, 2014, the Venezuelan government announced the expansion of the SICAD1 auction program to prospective dividends and royalties and new profit margin
controls. As the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary declares dividends or pays royalties in the future, based on the availability of U.S. dollars exchanged under the SICAD1 program, the realized exchange losses on payments made in U.S. dollars
would be recognized in earnings. On profit margin controls, the Company continues to ensure the Company is complying with the requirements.

In February
2014, the Venezuelan government announced plans to launch a third foreign exchange mechanism, known as SICAD2, which became operational on March 24, 2014. SICAD2 relies on U.S. dollar cash and U.S. dollar denominated bonds offered by the
Venezuelan Central Bank, PDVSA (the national


oil and gas company) and private companies. The Venezuelan government has allowed that all industry sectors will be able to access SICAD2 and has indicated that its use will not be restricted as
to purpose. As of January 3, 2015, the published SICAD2 rate was 51.0 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.

In February 2015, the Venezuelan government
announced plans to launch a new foreign exchange mechanism, known as SIMADI, which is expected to become operational in 2015. The SIMADI exchange mechanism, which will replace SICAD2, has been reported to be an open market in which rates will be
determined based on supply and demand.

In light of the current difficult macroeconomic environment in Venezuela, the Company continues to monitor and
actively manage its investment and exposures in Venezuela. The Company’s Venezuelan business does not rely heavily on imports and when items are imported, they are largely exchanged at the CENCOEX rate. As of January 3, 2015 the Company
translated its Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to U.S. dollars using the CENCOEX exchange rate. The Company will continue to monitor local conditions, the continued ability to obtain U.S. dollars at the CENCOEX exchange rate, and
the use, if applicable, of the SICAD1, SICAD2 or SIMADI, once operational, mechanisms to determine the appropriate rate for translation. For fiscal year 2014, Venezuela represented approximately 2% of total net sales and 5% of total operating
profit. As of January 3, 2015, the Company’s net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar were approximately $100 million in U.S. dollars applying the CENCOEX exchange rate.

If the CENCOEX exchange rate were to devalue further or if the currently less favorable SICAD1 exchange rate were extended to apply to a greater portion of the
Company’s net monetary assets in Venezuela, the Company could recognize a devaluation charge in earnings. The Company continues to monitor the currency developments in Venezuela and take protective measures against currency devaluation which
may include converting monetary assets into non-monetary assets which the Company can use in its business.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

Kellogg Company is the world’s leading producer of cereal, second
largest producer of cookies and crackers and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods. Additional product offerings include toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and
marketed globally. Principal markets for these products include the United States and United Kingdom.

The Company has the following reportable
segments: U.S. Morning Foods; U.S. Snacks; U.S. Specialty; North America Other; Europe; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. The Company manages its operations through eight operating segments that are based on product category or
geographic location. These operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they
can be aggregated into reportable segments. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Kashi operating segment, which was formerly aggregated with the U.S. Morning Foods operating segment and reported as U.S. Morning Foods and Kashi, was
revised due to a reorganization of the business. Kashi operating segment results of prior years were recast between U.S. Morning Foods and U.S. Snacks to conform with current presentation. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail
below.

The U.S. Morning Foods operating segment includes cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.

U.S. Snacks includes cookies, crackers, cereal bars, savory snacks and fruit-flavored snacks.

U.S. Specialty primarily represents food away from home channels, including food service, convenience, vending, Girl Scouts and food manufacturing. The food service business is mostly non-commercial, serving
institutions such as schools and hospitals. The convenience business includes traditional convenience stores as well as alternate retailing outlets.

North America Other includes the U.S. Frozen and Canada operating segments. As these operating segments are not considered economically similar enough to
aggregate with other operating segments and are immaterial for separate disclosure, they have been grouped together as a single reportable segment.

The
three remaining reportable segments are based on geographic location — Europe which consists principally of European countries; Latin America which is comprised of Central and South America and includes Mexico; and Asia Pacific which is
comprised of South Africa, Australia and other Asian and Pacific markets.

The measurement of reportable segment results is based on segment operating
profit which is generally consistent with the presentation of operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Intercompany transactions between operating segments were insignificant in all periods presented.

(a)

Includes asset impairment charges as discussed in Note 12.


Certain items such as interest expense and income taxes, while not included in the measure of reportable segment
operating results, are regularly reviewed by Management for the Company’s internationally-based reportable segments as shown below.

Management reviews balance sheet information, including total assets, based on geography. For all North American-based operating
segments, balance sheet information is reviewed by Management in total and not on an individual operating segment basis.

The Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 21% of consolidated net
sales during 2014, 21% in 2013, and 20% in 2012, comprised principally of sales within the United States.

Supplemental geographic information is
provided below for net sales to external customers and long-lived assets:

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes. We believe that the consolidated financial
statements present the Company’s financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States, using our best estimates and judgments as required.

The independent registered public accounting firm audits the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board and provides an objective, independent review of the fairness of reported operating results and financial position.

The board of directors of the Company has an Audit Committee composed of five non-management Directors. The Committee meets regularly with management, internal
auditors, and the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters.

Formal policies and procedures, including an active Ethics and Business Conduct program, support the internal controls and are designed to ensure employees adhere
to the highest standards of personal and professional integrity. We have a rigorous internal audit program that independently evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of these internal controls.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for designing, maintaining and evaluating adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of January 3, 2015. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which follows.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Kellogg Company

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Kellogg Company and its subsidiaries at January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 3, 2015 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2015, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

(a) We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

As of January 3, 2015, management carried out an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

(b) Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we have included a report of management’s assessment of the design and effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also attested to, and reported on, the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting. Management’s report and the independent registered public accounting firm’s attestation report are included in our 2014 financial statements in Item 8 of this Report under the captions entitled
“Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” and are incorporated herein by reference.

(c) During the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed a significant upgrade to and re-implementation of our existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) system
within North America. The implementation, which began in 2012, resulted in the modification of certain business processes and internal controls impacting financial reporting. During the implementation, we took the necessary steps to monitor and
maintain appropriate internal controls around financial reporting.

During the third quarter of 2014, we went live with the first phase of our Global
Business Services (GBS) initiative, in conjunction with Project K, which includes the reorganization and relocation of certain financial service processes, internal to the organization. This initiative is expected to continue through 2016 and will
impact the design of our control framework. During the transition to GBS, we have put additional controls in place to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls impacting financial reporting.

There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

than a stock option or stock appreciation right, or potentially issuable pursuant to an outstanding award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right, which will in each case reduce the total number of shares remaining by one share for
each share issued.

Three plans are considered “Equity
compensation plans not approved by security holders.” The Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, which was adopted in 2002 and is available to most U.K. employees of specified Kellogg Company subsidiaries; a similar plan, which is available to employees
in the Republic of Ireland; and the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which was adopted in 1986 and amended in 1993 and 2002.

Under the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, eligible U.K. employees may contribute up to 1,500 Pounds Sterling annually to the plan through payroll deductions. The
trustees of the plan use those contributions to buy shares of our common stock at fair market value on the open market, with Kellogg matching those contributions on a 1:1 basis. Shares must be withdrawn from the plan when employees cease employment.
Under current law, eligible employees generally receive certain income and other tax benefits if those shares are held in the plan for a specified number of years. A similar plan is also available to employees in the Republic of Ireland. As these
plans are open market plans with no set overall maximum, no amounts for these plans are included in the above table. However, approximately 58,000 shares were purchased by eligible employees under the Kellogg Share Incentive Plan, the plan for the
Republic of Ireland and other similar predecessor plans during 2014, with approximately an additional 58,000 shares being provided as matched shares.

The Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors was amended and restated during 2013. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors,
non-employee Directors may elect to defer all or part of their compensation (other than expense reimbursement) into units which are credited to their accounts. The units have a value equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on
the appropriate date, with dividend equivalents being earned on the whole units in non-employee Directors’ accounts. Units must be paid in shares of our common stock, either in a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments, with the
installments to begin as soon as practicable after the non-employee Director’s service as a Director terminates. No more than 300,000 shares are authorized for use under this plan, of which approximately 1,000 had been issued as of
January 3, 2015.
