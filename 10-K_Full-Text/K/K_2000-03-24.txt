PART I

Item 1.  Business

The Company.

Kellogg Company, incorporated in Delaware in
1922, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and
marketing of ready-to-eat cereal and convenience food products on
 a worldwide basis. The address of the principal business office
of Kellogg Company is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle
Creek, Michigan 49016-3599. Unless otherwise indicated by the
context, the term “Company” as used in this report
means Kellogg Company, its divisions and subsidiaries.

Financial Information About Segments.

The information
called for by this Item is incorporated herein by reference from
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 33
 and 34 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Principal Products.

The principal products of the Company
are ready-to-eat cereals and convenience food products which are
manufactured in 20 countries and distributed in more than 160
countries. The Company’s products are generally marketed
under the KELLOGG’S® and MORNINGSTAR FARMS® names
and are sold principally to the grocery trade through direct
sales forces for resale to consumers. The Company uses broker and
 distribution arrangements for certain products as well as in
less-developed market areas. Additional information pertaining to
 the relative sales of ready-to-eat cereals and the
Company’s convenience food products is found in Note 14 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 33
and 34 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Convenience Food Products.

In the United States, in
addition to ready-to-eat cereals, the Company produces and
distributes toaster pastries, frozen waffles, frozen pancakes,
crispy marshmallow squares, cereal bars, and meat alternatives.
The Company also markets these and other convenience food
products in various locations throughout the world, including
Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Australia.

Raw Materials.

Agricultural commodities are the principal
raw materials used in the Company’s products. Cartonboard,
corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials
used by the company. World supplies and prices of such
commodities and materials are constantly monitored, as are
government trade policies. The cost of raw materials may
fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather
 conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. Continuous
efforts are made to maintain and improve the qualities and
supplies of raw materials for purposes of the Company’s
short-term and long-term requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products produced by the Company
 in the United States include corn grits, oats, rice, soy beans,
various fruits, sweeteners, wheat, and wheat derivatives.
Ingredients are purchased principally from sources in the United
States. In producing toaster pastries, frozen waffles, and cereal
 bars, the Company may use flour, shortening, sweeteners, dairy
products, eggs, fruit, and other filling ingredients, which
ingredients are obtained from various sources.

The Company both enters into long-term contracts for raw
materials and purchases raw materials on the open market,
depending on the Company’s view of possible price
fluctuations, supply levels, and the Company’s relative
negotiating power. While the cost of raw materials may increase
over time, the Company believes that it will be able to purchase
an adequate supply of such raw materials as needed. The Company
also uses commodity futures and options to hedge some of its raw
material costs. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in the Company’s Annual
Report on pages 32 and 33.

Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based
operations are available in adequate supply and are sometimes
imported from countries other than those where used in
manufacture.

Cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international
facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane
obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers.
Short-term standby propane storage exists at several plants for
use in the event of interruption in natural gas supplies.
Additionally, oil may be used to fuel certain operations at
various plants in the event of natural gas shortages or when its
use presents economic advantages.

Trademarks and Technology.

Generally, the Company’s
products are marketed under trademarks owned by the Company. The
Company’s principal trademarks are its housemark, brand
names, slogans, and designs


related to cereals and other convenience food products
manufactured and marketed by the Company as well as licensed uses
 of these marks on various goods. These trademarks include

toaster pastries; Eggo®, Special K® and
Nutri-Grain® for frozen waffles and pancakes; Rice Krispies
Treats™ for crispy marshmallow squares; and Morningstar
Farms®, Loma Linda®, Natural Touch® and

Kellogg’s® Razzle Dazzle Rice Krispies™ and Rice
Krispies®; Tony the Tiger™ for Kellogg’s Frosted
Flakes® and Kellogg’s Cocoa Frosted Flakes™;
Toucan Sam® for Froot Loops®; Dig ’Em!®
for Smacks®; Coco™for Cocoa Krispies®; and
Cornelius® and Corny™ for Kellogg’s Corn

The slogans “The Best To You Each Morning”®,
“The Original and Best®”, and “They’re
Gr-r-reat!”® used in connection with the Company’s
 ready-to-eat cereals, along with “L’ Eggo my
Eggo”™, used in connection with the Company’s
frozen waffles and pancakes, are also important Company
trademarks. The Company’s use of the advertising themes
“Better Breakfast”™, “Get A Taste For The
Healthy Life”™, and “Cereal...Eat It For
Life”™ represent part of its effort to establish
throughout the United States and the world the concept of a
nutritious breakfast.

The Company considers that, taken as a whole, the rights under
its various patents, which expire from time to time, are a
valuable asset, but the Company does not believe that its
businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or group
 of related patents. The Company’s activities under licenses
 or other franchises or concessions are not material.

Seasonality.

Demand for the Company’s products is
approximately level throughout the year.

Working Capital.

Although terms vary around the world, in
the United States the Company generally requires payment for
goods sold eleven days subsequent to the date of invoice, with a
2% discount allowed for payment within ten days. Receipts from
goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide for
the Company’s payment of dividends, capital expansion, and
for other operating expenses and working capital needs.

Customers.

The Company is not dependent on any single
customer or a few customers for a material part of its sales.
However, in the United States, the Company’s top four
customers account for over 20% of net sales. There has been
significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in
recent years and the Company believes that this trend is likely
to continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an
extended length of time could negatively impact the
Company’s sales and profits, the Company does not anticipate
 that this will occur due to the consumer demand for our products
 and our relationships with our customers. Products of the
Company are sold through its own sales forces and through broker
and distributor arrangements and are generally resold to
consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service
establishments.

Backlog.

For the most part, orders are filled within a few
 days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time
prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at any
particular time is not material to the Company.


Competition.

The Company has experienced intense
competition for sales of all of its principal products in its
major markets, both domestically and internationally. The
Company’s products compete with advertised and branded
products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private
label products, which are typically distributed at lower prices,
and generally with other food products with different
characteristics. Principal methods and factors of competition
include new product introductions, product quality, composition
and nutritional value, price, advertising, and promotion.

Research and Development.

Research to support and expand
the use of the Company’s existing products and to develop
new food products is carried on at the W.K. Kellogg
Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek,
Michigan, and at other locations around the world. The
Company’s expenditures for research and development were
approximately $104.1 million in 1999, $121.9 million in
 1998, and $106.1 million in 1997.

Environmental Matters.

The Company’s facilities are
subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and
regulations regarding the discharge of material into the
environment and the protection of the environment in other ways.
The Company is not a party to any material proceedings arising
under these regulations. The Company believes that compliance
with existing environmental laws and regulations will not
materially affect the financial condition or the competitive
position of the Company. The Company is currently in substantial
compliance with all material environmental regulations affecting
the Company and its properties.

Employees.

At December 31, 1999, the Company had
15,051 employees.

information called for by this Item is incorporated herein by
reference from Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
on pages 33 and 34 of the Company’s Annual Report.

money for capital and technological improvements. At the time of
its selection, each location was considered to be favorable,
based on the location of markets, sources of raw materials,
availability of suitable labor, transportation facilities,
location of other Company plants producing similar products, and
other factors. Manufacturing facilities of the Company in the
United States include four cereal plants and warehouses located
in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Memphis,
Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska. The Company’s United States

sufficient capacity for its current operations.
