ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications

infrastructure, including

tower structures, rooftop

,

and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as

“

towers

” or “

sites.

”

Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed

98.7%

of our total segment operating profit for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. In our site leasing business, we (1) lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of

December 31, 2016

, we owned

26,197

towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. We also managed or leased approximately

5,500

actual or potential

site

s, approximately


of which were revenue producing as of

December 31, 2016

. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks. Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in

Canada, Central America, and

South America.

In October 2016, we announced our intention to take the necessary steps to qualify as a

Real Estate Investment Trust (“

REIT

”)

for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  We refer to this as the REIT conversion.  We believe that our business has been operated in a manner that complies with the REIT rules since January 1, 2016, and as a result, we intend to make the election to be subject to tax as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016.  Because we believe our business is currently operated in a manner that complies with the REIT rules, no further reorganization of our operations is necessary to complete the REIT conversion.  As part of the REIT conversion, effective January 1


, 2017, we completed the merger with our predecessor that was approved by our shareholders at a special meeting held

o

n January

12,


. A

s a result of the merger, we now hold, directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, the assets held by our predecessor prior to the merger and conduct the existing businesses of our predecessor and its subsidiaries.  Although the REIT rules do not require the completion of this merger, we completed the merger to facilitate our compliance with the REIT rules by ensuring the effective adoption of certain REIT-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions related to our capital stock.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—REIT Conversion” for more

information.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the United States, Canada, Central America, and South America. We

derive

site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service

provider tenants, including AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, Oi S.A., Telefonica, Claro

, and TIM

. Wireless service providers enter

into tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site. Our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit, representing

96.3%

or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three

fiscal

years. Our site leasing business is classified into two reportable segments, domestic site leasing and international site leasing.

Domestic Site Leasing

As of

December 31, 2016

, we

owne

d

15,922

sites in the United States

and its territories

.  For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we generated

82.8%

of our total site leasing revenue from these sites. We

derive

domestic site leasing revenues primarily from AT&T, T

-Mobile,

Sprint,

and Verizon Wireless. W

ire

less service providers

enter into tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at

each

individual

site

.

In the United States

, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods.

Our ground leases in the United States are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of

five

-year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 2-3% annually.

As of

December 31, 2016

, (1) no U.S. state or territory included more than 10% of

our

total tower portfolio by tower count, and (2) no U.S. state or territory

accounted for more than 10% of

our

total revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

International Site Leasing

W

e continue to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers. We believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a high-growth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments. As of

December 31, 2016

, we owned



10,275

towers in our international markets, including Canada,

Central America, and South America

.

Approximately 28% of our

total towers are lo

cated in Brazil and less than 3%

of our total towers

are located in each of our other international markets

(each country is considered a market)

.

We deri

ve international site leasing revenues primarily

from Oi S.A., Telefonica, Claro, and TIM. Our operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business, and we expect to continue to expand

operations throu

gh acquisitions

and new builds

.

In

Canada

, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. Tenant leases in our Central American and South American markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods. In Central America, we have similar

fixed

rent escalators to that of leases in the United States and Canada while our leases in South America escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index.

In Brazil,

tenant

leases are typically governed by master lease agreements, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site.

Tenant

leases in South America typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass-through charge for the underlying ground lease rent.  Our ground leases in Canada, Central America and South America generally have similar terms and conditions as those in the United States, except that the annual escalators in our South American ground leases are based on a cost of living index.

Our operations in Central America and Ecuador are primarily denominated in United States Dollars, while our operations in Canada and the remainder of South America are denominated in local currencies.

Domestic and International Expansion

We expand our tower portfolio, both domestically and internationally, through the acquisition of towers from third parties and through the construction of new tower structures. In our tower acquisition program, we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns. For each acquisition, we prepare various analyses that include projections of a five-year unlevered internal rate of return, review of available capacity, future lease up projections, and a summary of current and future tenant/technology mix.

The majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the United States. Accordingly, our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by (i) wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks, (ii) increased consumer mobile data traffic, such as media streaming, mobile apps and games, web browsing, and email, and (iii) incremental spectrum auctions, which have resulted in new market entrants, as well as incremental voice and data network deployments. Since we first entered the Central and South American markets, we have built or acquired

10,003

towers

as of

December 31, 2016

and continue to expand in these markets to respond to growing demand.

We consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion, including:

·

Country analysis – We consider the country’s

economic and

political stability, and whether the country’s general business, legal and regulatory environment is conducive to the sustainability and growth of our business.

·

Market potential – We analyze the expected demand for wireless services, and whether a country has multiple wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks, as well as spectrum auctions that have occurred or that are anticipated to occur.

·

Risk adjusted return criteria – We consider whether buying or building towers in a country, and providing our management and leasing services, will meet our return criteria. As part of this analysis, we consider the risk of entering into an international market (for example, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates

, real estate, permitting, and taxation risks

), and how our expansion meets our long-term strategic objectives for the region and our business generally.

In our new build program, we construct tower structures (1) in locations that are strategically chosen by us or (2) under build-to-suit arrangements. Under build-to-suit arrangements, we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified. Under these arrangements, we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to co-locate additional tenants. When we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us, we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need, or will n

eed

to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands. We seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete pre-construction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts. We generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants.



Site Development Services

Our site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas

on existing infrastructure

; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional,

market

, and project offices. The

market

offices are responsible for all site development operations.

For financial information about our operating segments, please see Note 18 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

Industry Developments

We believe that growing wireless traffic (particularly data and video), the deployment of additional spectrum, and technology advancements will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of towers that they utilize and additions

or

changes to the equipment they deploy at existing towers. We expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends:

·

As wireless

data

traffic continues to grow,

carriers are investing to increase the capacity of their networks; and we believe that the continued capacity increases will require our customers to add additional cell sites and additional new equipment at current cell sites.

·

Spectrum licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) has enabled continued network development. We expect the deployment of currently fallow spectrum and the availability of additional spectrum through a government auction anticipated to

be completed in 2017

to drive continued network development in the U.S.

·

Consumers are increasing their

demand for

wireless

connectivity

due to expansion of wireless data applications, such as video, mobile apps and games, web browsing, email and social networking, and continued wireline to wireless migration. Wireless devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and

other emerging and embedded devices continue to trend toward being more bandwidth-intensive. As a result, according to industry estimates, global mobile data traffic will grow at an

approximate

ly 47% compound annual growth rate from 2016 to 2021 and will grow at a rate three times faster than non-mobile data

traffic over the same period.

·

Consumers list network quality as

a key contributor

when terminating or changing service. To decrease subscriber churn rate, wireless carriers have made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage.

W

e expect

U.S. wireless carriers to continue to expend capital for the f

oreseeable future

in order to

continue to improve their networks.

We believe that the world-wide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably well-capitalized, highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services. Therefore, we expect that we will see a multi-year trend of additional demand for tower space from our customers, which we believe will translate into st

eady

leasing growth for us.

Business Strategy

Our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins, and low customer churn

(which refers to when a customer does not renew its lease, or, in very limited circumstances, such as

in

a customer bankruptcy, cancels its lease prior to the end of its term)

other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of

a particular technology

(e.g. iDEN)

.

The long-term and repetitive nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business, which is more cyclical. By focusing on our site leasing business, we believe that we can maintain a stable, recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending. Key elements of our strategy include:

Maximizing Use of Tower Capacity.

We generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures. Most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas, and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost.

We measure the available



capacity of our existing facilities to support additional tenants and generate additional lease revenue by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, wind loading, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located.

We actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had an average of

1.8

tenants per tower structure.

Disciplined Growth of our Tower Portfolio

.

We believe that our tower operations are highly scalable

. Consequently, we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling, general, and administrative expenses. We intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures. In connection with our international expansion, we have targeted select international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communications industry. We intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity, including borrowings, to build and/or acquire new towers

at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our long-term target leverage ratios.

Capitalizing on our Scale and Management Experience.

We are a large owner, operator and developer of towers, with substantial capital, human, and operating resources. We have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the U.S. since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997. We believe our size, experience, capabilities, and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the U.S. and internationally. Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development, with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries. We believe that our industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services.

Controlling our Underlying Land Positions

. We have purchased and/or entered into perpetual easements or long-term leases for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so, to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices. We believe that these purchases, perpetual easements, and/or long-term leases will increase our margins, improve our cash flow from operations, and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future. As of

December 31, 2016

, approximately

72%

of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, was


years. As of

December 31, 2016

, approximately

6.2%

of our tower structures ha

d

ground leases maturing in the next 10 years.

Using our Local Presence to Build Strong Relationships with Major Wireless Service Providers.

Given the nature of towers as location-specific communications facilities, we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally. Consequently, we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience, expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships. We are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally. Due to our presence in local markets, we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets.

Customers

Since commencing operations, we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large U.S. wireless service providers. In both our site leasing and site development businesses, we work with large national providers and smaller regiona

l, local, or private operators. Internationally, we service all the major service providers in Canada, Central America, and South America.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues. The following customers represented at least 10% of our total revenues during the last three years:

﻿

﻿

﻿

(1)

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of AT&T Wireless and Leap Wireless (Cricket Wireless).



In addition to the Big 4 wireless carriers (

AT&T, T

-Mobile,

Sprint,

and Verizon Wireless), w

e

have also

provided services or leased space to a number of customers including:

﻿

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing goals are to:

·

use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with respect to our owned or managed towers, enabling us to grow our site leasing business; and

·

successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins and/or provide a financial or strategic benefit to our site leasing business.

We approach sales on a company-wide basis, involving many of our employees. We have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team. Our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in our corporate office. We also rely on our vice presidents, general managers, and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers. Our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers. Most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices. We believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters. Our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate. Our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentive-based goals and measurements.

Competition

Domestic Site Leasing

– In the U.S., our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are (1) the national independent tower companies including American Tower Corporation and Crown Castle International, (2) a large number of regional independent tower owners, (3) wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers, and (4) alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, billboards,

utility poles,

and electric transmission towers. American Tower and Crown Castle have significantly more towers than we do, which could provide them a competitive advantage in negotiating with wireless service providers. Furthermore, these entities generally have greater financial resources than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage in connection with the acquisition of material tower portfolios. However, we believe that tower location and capacity have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. Other competitive factors are quality of service to our tenants and price.

International Site Leasing

– Our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks, large national and regional independent tower companies

, and alternative facilities such as rooftop, outdoor and indoor DAS networks, billboards, utility poles, and electric transmission towers

.

Site Development

– The site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive. We believe that the majority of our competitors in the U.S. site development business operate within local market areas exclusively, while some firms offer their services nationally. The market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site development consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors, which provide end-to-end site development services through multiple subcontractors, and wireless service providers’ internal staff. We believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria, including company experience, price, track record, local reputation, geographic reach, and time for completion of a project.



Employees

Our corporate

offices

are located in our headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.

We also have

employees

located

in our international, regional, and local offices. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

1,241

employees of which


were based outside of the U.S. and its territories. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Regulatory and Environmental Matters

Federal Regulations.

In the U.S., which accounted for

82.8%

of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, both the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) regulate towers. Many FAA requirements are implemented in FCC regulations. These regulations, which were amended in 2014, govern the construction, lighting, and painting or other marking of towers, as well as the maintenance, inspection, and record keeping related to towers, and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed, altered or used. Wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used. In addition, any applicant for an FCC tower structure registration (through the FCC’s Antenna Structure Registration System) must certify that, consistent with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, neither the applicant nor its princip

als are subject to a denial of f

ederal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance. New tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site: compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”); compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”); compliance with the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”); and may require notification to the FAA.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the FCC, in conjunction with the FAA, has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers. These standards mandate that the FCC and the FAA consider the height of the proposed tower, the relationship of the tower to existing natural or man-made obstructions, and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. The FAA may condition its issuance of a no-hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting and/or painting requirements. Towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the FCC. A tower that requires FAA clearance will not be registered by the FCC until it is cleared by the FAA. Upon registration, the FCC may also require special lighting and/or painting. Owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with FAA and FCC regulations. Tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the FAA of any lighting outage or malfunction.

Owners and operators of towers may be subject to, and therefore must comply with, environmental laws, including NEPA, NHPA and ESA. Any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the NEPA, among other statutes, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances. The FCC has issued regulations implementing the NEPA. These regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower. In the event the FCC determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the FCC has developed, the FCC would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which will be subject to public comment. This process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower.

We generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction, modification, or placement of towers. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction, modification, and placement of towers. The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of radio communication towers. Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities. This may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities.

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination and related personal injury or property damage. We are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require pre-construction environmental studies. Operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency (“RF”) emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and



operating requirements. Certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to RF emissions. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can produce negative health effects. The potential connection between low-level RF energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws. These costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

State and Local Regulations.

Most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition, leasing activities, and construction activities. Where required, we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents, who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors, and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors, who may be our employees or independent contractors. Local regulations include city and other local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations, or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers. In addition, many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations. Local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers, and have, in some instances, instituted moratoria.

International

. Regulatory regimes outside of the U.S. and its territories vary by country and locality; however, these regulations typically require tower owners and/or licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Additionally, some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting, lighting, and maintenance. Our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas. Based on our experience to date, these regimes have been similar to, but not more rigorous, burdensome or comprehensive than, those in the U.S. Non-compliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders. Our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters. As we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas, we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions.

Backlog

Backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments, which have been signed, but have not yet commenced. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had


new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases and amendments will contractually provide for approximately

$8.7

million of annual revenue. By comparison, as of

December 31, 2015

, we had


new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases and amendments contractually provided for approximately

$6.6

million of annual revenue.

Our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed under executed contracts. As of

December 31, 2016

ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Business

If our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our future operating results

,

ability to service our indebtedness

, and stock price

could be adversely affected.

Significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar

, or acquired technologies may be discontinued

. In connection with the combinations of Verizon Wireless and ALLTEL (to form Verizon Wireless), Cingular and AT&T Wireless (to form AT&T Mobility) and Sprint PCS and Nextel (to form Sprint), the combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks,

and, in the case of Sprint, the Nextel iDEN network was discontinued,

which has led and may continue to lead to the non-renewal of certain leases on our towers. During 2013, Sprint acquired Clearwire Communications and T-Mobile acquired MetroPCS, and in 2014, AT&T acquired Leap Wireless (Cricket Wireless). Th

ese

consolidation

s have led and

may also lead to

additional

non-renewal of certain of our tower leases. If our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of, among other factors, limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the U.S., th

ese

consolidation

s

could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results

and our ability to service our indebtedness. These risks could be exacerbated due to changes in governmental policy that may favor industry consolidation

.

In addition, the market price of our Class A common stock may be affected by the economic and market perception of the announcement or consummation of wireless service provider customer consolidations and their impact on our future operating results.

We have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.

As indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our deficit. The following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ deficit as of

December 31, 2016

and


.

﻿

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest, or other amounts due on our indebtedness. Subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured debt. This may have the effect of increasing our total leverage. For example, on

July 7, 2016

, we, through a New York common law trust, issued $


00.0 million aggregate principal amount of Tower Securities

, and on August 15, 2016, we issued $1.1 billion of unsecured senior notes

.

As a consequence of our indebtedness, (1) demands on our cash resources may increase, (2) we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (3) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. For example, as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the U.S. economy:

•

we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise, thereby reducing our cash flows;

•

we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best long-term interests;



•

we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments, including

share repurchases,

tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures

, or to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements

;

•

we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;

•

we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and

•

we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations.

These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions

, share repurchases,

or other opportunities

and to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements

.

In addition, fluctuations in market interest rates

or changes in central bank monetary policy

may increase interest

expense

relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur

pursuant to

our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans, and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all. There is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenue

and adversely affect our financial condition.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. Consequently, a reduction in demand for site leasing, reduced future capital expenditures on the networks, or the loss, as a result of bankruptcy, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise, of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth.

On June 20, 2016, Oi, S.A. (“Oi”), our largest customer in Brazil, filed a petition for judicial reorganization in Brazil. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, Oi comprised approximately

7.5%

of our total site leasing revenue. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of amounts owed by Oi prior to the date of Oi’s petition, we recorded a $16.5 million bad debt provision during the second quarter of 2016 relating to amounts owed or potentially owed by Oi as of the

petition

date. While we continue to do business with Oi under our contracts in the ordinary course and Oi has stated its intentions to continue normal operations during its judicial reorganization, we cannot assure you that Oi will continue to be willing or able to continue to make payments to us in accordance with the terms of our contracts. Judicial reorganization in Brazil requires the agreement of certain creditors, for which there can be no assurance. If Oi is unable to successfully reorganize, it may be forced to liquidate. If Oi is unable or unwilling to reorganize in a manner that continues to provide us anticipated payments in accordance with our contracts, it could materially decrease our revenues and adversely affect our financial condition.

The following is a list of significant customers (representing at least 10% of revenue in any of the last three years) and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time period

s derived from these customers:

﻿

﻿



We also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments:

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

(1)

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of AT&T Wireless and Leap Wireless (Cricket Wireless).

﻿

We derive revenue through numerous site leasing contracts and site development contracts. Each site leasing contract relates to

the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the U.S. and Canada, and renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. Site leasing contracts in our Central American and South American markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods. However, if any of our significant site leasing customers were to experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. In addition, a customer’s need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. Furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects.

﻿

Currency fluctuations may negatively affect our results of operations.

We have business operations in Canada, Central America, and South America.  Our operations in Central America and Ecuador are primarily denominated in United States

d

ollars, while our operations in Canada and

the remainder of South America

are denominated in local currencies.  Our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses are translated into United States dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

,

approximately

16.3%

of our total cash site leasin

g revenue was generated by our i

nternational operations, of which

11.6%

was generated in non-U

.

S

.

dollar currencies, including

10.8%

which was

denominat

ed in Brazilian Rea

l

. The exchange rates between our foreign currencies and the United States Dollar have fluctuated significantly recently and may continue to do so in the future.  For example, the Brazilian Real has historically been subject to substantial volatility and

weaken

ed

5.5%

when

comparing the

average

r

ate for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


.

This trend has affected, and may in the future continue to affect, our reported results of operations.

Changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the United States

d

ollar will affect the recorded levels of site leasing revenue, segment operating profit, assets and/or liabilities. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts.



Furthermore, we have an intercompany loan agreement which permits one of our Brazilian entities to borrow amounts up to $750.0 million. As of

December 31, 2016

, the outstanding balance under this agreement

was $433.3 million

. In accordance with ASC 830, we remeasure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations

as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future

. Consequently, if the U.S. Dollar strengthen

s

against the Brazilian Real, our results of operations would be adversely affected. For the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, we recorded

a

$90.0

million

gain and a

$178.9

million

loss,

respectively

,

on remeasurement of

the

intercompany loan

due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our real property interests relating to

the land under

our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and other similar interests. From time to time, we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures, which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers. Further, landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators and our competitors, which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all. In addition, the land underlying the 2,113 towers we acquired in 2013 from Oi, one of Brazil’s largest telecommunications providers, is subject to a concession from the Federal Republic of Brazil that expires in 2025.  At the end of the term, the Brazilian government will have the right to (i) renew the concession upon newly negotiated terms or (ii) terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land.  Although Oi has entered into a non-terminable lease with us for 35 years, if the concession is not renewed, our site leasing revenue from co-located tenants would terminate prior to the end of such lease. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we generated

12.0%

of our total international site leasing revenue from these 2,113 towers of which

7.4%

related to Oi and

4.6%

represented revenue from co-located tenants.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, was approximately


years, and approximately

6.2%

of our tower structures have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years.  Failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of ope

rations or financial condition.

New technologies

or network architecture or changes in a customer’s business model

may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.

Improvements

or changes

in the efficiency, architecture, and design of wireless networks

or changes in a wireless service provider customer’s business model

may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure.

In addition, as customers deploy increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies, they may allocate less of their budgets to lease space on our towers.

For example, new technologies that may promote network sharing, joint development, or resale agreements by our

wireless service provider

customers, such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization, may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure. In addition, other technologies

and architectures

, such as WiFi, DAS, femtocells, other small cells, or satellite (such as low earth orbiting) and mesh transmission systems may, in the future, serve as substitutes for, or alternatives to,

the traditional macro site cellular architecture that is the basis of substantially all of our site leasing business.

In addition, new technologies that enhance the range, efficiency, and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure.

Further, a customer may decide to no longer outsource wireless infrastructure or otherwise change its business model.

Any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from new technologies

or new architectures or changes in a customer’s business model

may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have

a material adverse effect on us

.

Increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term.

We intend to continue growing our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, through acquisitions and new builds. Our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements. Traditionally, our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies, independent tower developers and wireless service providers. However, as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these mid-sized tower transactions available

in the U.S.

and there is more competition to acquire existing towers. Increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer

acquisition opportunities for us, higher acquisition prices, and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers. For example, in 2016, we passed on more U.S. acquisitions than we did in 2015 due to asset quality, price, or lease terms. Furthermore

, to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we do.  Finally, competition regulations, domestically and internationally, may limit our ability to acquire certain portfolios or apply to us differently than they apply to our competitors.  As a result of these risks, the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be



able to meet our annual and long-term tower portfolio growth targets. If we are not able to successfully address these challenges, we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the long-term.

O

ur ability to build new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits. Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification.  With respect to our international new builds, our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions, inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets. Due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds, domestically and internationally, than anticipated, the costs of constructing these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in


. If we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals.

Our international operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position.

Our current business operations in Canada, Central America, and South America, and our expansion into any other international markets in the future, could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. The consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were

approximately

16.2%

during the year ended

December 31, 2016

, and we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow in the future. Accordingly, our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;

•

laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital;

•

laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business, including zoning, maintenance and environmental matters, and laws related to ownership of real property;

•

laws and regulations governing our employee relations, including occupational health and safety matters;

•

changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers, which may be applied and enforced retroactively;

•

expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership;

•

laws effecting telecommunications infrastructure including the sharing of such infrastructure;

•

restriction or revocation of spectrum licenses;

•

our ability to comply with, and the costs of compliance with, anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar local anti-bribery laws;

•

our ability to compete with owners and operators of wireless towers that have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have;

•

uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems, including inconsistencies between and within laws, regulations and decrees, and judicial application thereof, and delays in the judicial process;

•

health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic;

•

difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel; and

•

language and cultural differences.



A slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues, and we cannot control that demand.

Additional revenue growth on our towers other than through contractual escalators comes directly from additional investment by our wireless service provider customers in their networks. If

consumers

significantly reduce their minutes of use or data usage, or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications, our wireless service provider customers

c

ould experience a decrease in demand for their services. Regardless of consumer demand, each wireless service

provider

customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks, including licenses for spectrum. In addition, our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing, roaming or resale arrangements. As a result of all of the above, wireless

service provide

rs may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire.

A key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions.  We rely on our due diligence of the towers and the representations and financial records of the sellers and other third parties to establish the anticipated revenues and expenses and whether the acquired towers will meet our internal guidelines for current and future potential returns. In addition, we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title, access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers.  This is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers. To the extent that these towers were acquired in individually material transactions, we may be required to place enhanced reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers. If (i) these records are not complete or accurate, (ii) we do not have complete access to, or use of, the land underlying the acquired towers or (iii) the towers do not achieve the financial results anticipated, it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.

In addition, acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy, such as (i) an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquired towers do not achieve the

projected

financial results, (ii) unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions that may impact our results of operations for a period, (iii) increased demands on our cash resources that may, among other things, impact our ability to explore other opportunities, (iv) undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover, (v) increased vulnerability to general economic conditions, (vi) an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships, (vii) additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory, political and economic risks if such acquisitions were in new jurisdictions and (viii) diversion of managerial attention.

The process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. It may also result in the loss of key customers and/or personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities. These risks may be exacerbated in those circumstances in which we acquire a material number of towers. Further, we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire, and we may not be able to timely attract new skilled employees and management to replace them. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions into our existing business. This is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers.

Delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate.

There can be no assurances that 3G, 4G, including long-term evolution (“LTE”), advanced wireless service in the 1695-1710 MHz, 1755-1780 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz bands (the “AWS-3” bands), or other new wireless technologies

such as 5G

will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. The deployment of 3G

in the United States

experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries, and continued deployment of 4G could experience delays. Additionally, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated, particularly in certain of our international markets. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.

Increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us.

Our industry is highly competitive, and our

wireless service provider

customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space. Some of our competitors, such as (1) U.S. and international wireless carriers that allow co-location on their towers and (2) large independent tower companies, have been, and based on recent consolidations continue to be, substantially larger and have greater



financial resources than we do. This could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers.

In the site leasing business, we compete with:

•

wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers;

•

national and regional tower companies; and

•

alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor DAS networks, billboards and electric transmission towers.

We believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. However, competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. In addition, we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. Increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly, or limit the acquisition opportunities altogether. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

The site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. There are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business. As a result of this competition, margins in this segment may come under pressure. Many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable. If margins in this segment were to decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected.

The documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility.

The indentures governing the

2014 Senior

Notes

and the 2016 Senior Notes

, the Senior Credit Agreement, and the

mortgage loan underlying the

Tower Securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. Among other things, the covenants under each in

strument

limit our ability to:

•

merge, consolidate or sell assets;

•

make restricted payments, including pay dividends or make other distributions;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and

•

issue guarantees of indebtedness.

We are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the Senior Credit Agreement. The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, requires SBA Senior Finance II to maintain specific financial ratios, including (1) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA not to exceed 6.5 times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net Hedge Exposure (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.5 times for 30 consecutive days and (3) a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter.

Additionally, the mortgage loan relating to our Tower Securities contains financial covenants that require that the borrowers maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum debt service coverage ratio. To the extent that the debt service coverage ratio, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30 times or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account in

stead of being released to the



b

orrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the

b

orrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30 times for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15 times as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter.

These covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. Further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisitions or other opportunities. If we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments. If any default occurs, all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the Senior Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable.

Our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.

Fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans or upon refinancing our fixed rate debt. As a result, we are exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. There is no guarantee that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. We currently have no interest rate swaps.

Our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business.

We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our only significant assets are, and are expected to be, the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. We conduct, and expect to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. Most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries, including the mortgage loan underlying the Tower Securities, the Term Loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal, if any, under their respective indebtedness. Other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our

2014 Senior

Notes and

2016 Senior

Notes

and funds to be utilized for stock repurchases

, we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments.

Our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations.

The demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of long-term results. Numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including:

•

the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures;

•

the size and scope of our projects;

•

the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’ fiscal year;

•

delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment;

•

seasonal factors, such as weather, holidays and vacation days and total business days in a quarter;

•

the use of third party providers by our customers;



•

the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development; and

•

general economic conditions.

Although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space, in anticipation of future contracts. In addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. Therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in dem

and for our site development services.

We have not traditionally been profitable and may incur losses in the future.

In 2016, we were profitable; however, in 2015 and 2014, we were not profitable. The following chart shows the net income (losses) we incurred for the periods indicated:

﻿

﻿

During 2015 and 2014, our

losses

we

re principally due to depreciation, amortization

,

and accretion expenses, interest expense (including non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees),

and

losses from the extinguishment of debt

. In addition,

in 2015,

our loss included

remeasurement losses related to a foreign currency denominated intercompany loan.

The loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively

affect our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. We have employment agreements with Jeffrey A. Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kurt L. Bagwell, our Executive Vice President and President—International, Thomas P. Hunt, our Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, and Brendan T. Cavanagh, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. If we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business.

We are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., both the FAA and the FCC regulate the construction, modification, and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts. In addition, the FCC separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers. FAA and FCC regulations govern construction, lighting, painting, and marking of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower, require registration of the tower. Certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the FAA to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation.

Tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to FAA and FCC regulations and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. Tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any lighting outages. Certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from towers are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes, including NEPA, NHPA and ESA. Failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. In addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth.

Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification. Local regulations can delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. In addition, new regulations



may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us. Furthermore, with respect to our international new builds, our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions, inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations.

Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.

A part of our day-to-day operations, we rely on information technology and other computer resources and infrastructure to carry out important business activities and to maintain our business records. Our computer systems could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including through cyber-attack and data theft), errors, catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control. If our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, or breached, or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our tenants or landlords). This could damage our reputation and disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters

and other unforeseen events

.

Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes

or may collapse for any number of reasons, including structural deficiencies

. We maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. We also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. A tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition

and may harm our reputation

.

To the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers, due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances, our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses; however, we

may

be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower, including ground lease expenses. If we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. As owner, lessee, or operator of numerous tower structures, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee, or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. However, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions.

We are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business. We also have significant net operating losses (“NOLs”) in U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. Generally, for U.S. federal and state tax purposes, NOLs can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years, and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our NOLs are used or expire. We expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. If our tax benefits, including from our use of NOLs or other tax attributes, are challenged successfully by a taxing authority, we may be required to pay additional taxes or penalties, or make additional distributions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize NOLs in the future.

The issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. We may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control, caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. Depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change, an ownership change under Section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our NOLs and could result in us having to make additional cash distributions.

Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from RF energy.

The U.S. government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to RF energy. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can cause negative health effects. The potential connection between exposure to low levels of RF energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. According to the FCC, the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive. However, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. Moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of RF energy and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. Our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on RF energy exposure. If we were subject to claims relating to exposure to RF energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT

﻿

Complying with the REIT requirements may cause us to liquidate assets or hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities.

﻿

To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the nature and diversification of our assets, the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders. For example, to qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and “real estate assets” (as defined in the Code), including towers and certain mortgage loans and securities. The remainder of our investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable REIT

subsidiary (“

TRS”) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% (for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017) or 20% (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets.

﻿

In addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify and be subject to tax as a REIT, we will generally be required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income after the utilization of any available NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our shareholders. Our determination as to the timing or amount of future dividends will be based on a number of factors, including investment opportunities around our core business and the availability of our existing NOLs. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (after the application of available NOLs, if any), we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code. These distribution requirements could hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities. Furthermore, our ability to compete for acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need, or require, the target company to comply with certain REIT requirements. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income, amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and amounts available for making payments on our indebtedness.

﻿



Qualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, to the extent we have REIT taxable income and have utilized our NOLs, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.

﻿

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.

﻿

Our Board of Directors has authorized us to take all necessary steps for SBAC to be subject to tax as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016. We received an opinion of our special REIT tax counsel with respect to our qualification as a REIT. Investors should be aware, however, that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or any court. The opinion represents only the view of such counsel based on its review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by us, including representations relating to the values of our assets and the sources of our income. The opinion is expressed as of the date issued. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.

﻿

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, to the extent we have REIT taxable income and have utilized our NOLs, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate assets to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment and making payments on our indebtedness would be reduced.

﻿

We may be required to borrow funds, sell assets, or raise equity to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.

﻿

From time to time, we may generate REIT taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings, to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs and our leverage, decrease our Adjusted Funds From Operations per share or require us to distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or stock repurchases.

﻿

Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Furthermore,

compliance with

the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, or expansion initiatives, which wou

ld increase our total leverage.

﻿

Covenants specified in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required REIT distributions.

﻿

The Senior Credit Agreement, the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions and the indentures governing our 2014 Senior Notes and 2016 Senior Notes contain certain covenants that could limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Under the Senior Credit Agreement, our subsidiaries may make distributions to us to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and additional amounts to distribute up to 100% of our REIT taxable income, so long as SBA Senior Finance II’s ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA does not exceed 6.5 times for any fiscal quarter. In addition, under the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions, or Securitization, a failure to comply with the Debt Service Coverage Ratio in that agreement could prevent our borrower subsidiaries from distributing any excess cash from the operation of their towers to us. Finally, while the indentures governing the 2014 Senior Notes and the 2016 Senior Notes permit us to make distributions to our shareholders to the extent such distributions are necessary to maintain our status as a REIT or to avoid entity level taxation, this authority is subject to the conditions that no default or event of default exists or would result therefrom and that the obligations under the 2014 Senior Notes or the 2016 Senior Notes, as applicable, have not otherwise been accelerated.

﻿

If these limits prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT. If these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our



REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax, and potentially the nondeductible 4% excise tax, on the retained amounts.

﻿

Our payment of cash distributions in the future is not guaranteed and the amount of any future cash distributions may fluctuate, which could adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.

﻿

REITs are required to distribute annually at least 90% of their REIT taxable

income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain).

A

s of

December 31, 2016

,

$1.1

billion

of the federal

NOLs

are attributes of the REIT. We may

use these NOLs to offset our REIT taxable income, and thus

any

required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as

the

NOLs have been fully utilized.

The Internal Revenue Code places limitations upon the future availability of NOLs based upon changes in our equity. If these occur, our

ability to offset future income with existing NOLs may be limited.

We currently expect that we will utilize available NOLs to reduce all or a portion of our REIT taxable income and therefore we may not initially make any distributions, which may adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock.

﻿

The amount of future distributions will be determined, from time to time, by the Board of Directors to balance our goal of increasing long-term shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy, which prioritizes investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, and then stock repurchases, when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value. The actual timing and amount of distributions will be as determined and declared by the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other factors, our NOLs, our financial condition, earnings, debt covenants and other possible uses of such funds. Consequently, our future distribution levels may fluctuate.

﻿

Certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which would reduce our cash flows, and would have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.

﻿

We may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. In addition, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. In addition, we may incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with a TRS if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.

﻿

Our TRS assets and operations also will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. We will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate (currently 35%) on the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring during our first five years as a REIT, up to the amount of the built-in gain that existed on January 1, 2016, which is based on the fair market value of those assets in excess of our tax basis in those assets as of January 1, 2016. Gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax. We currently do not expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability. We cannot, however, assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard.

﻿

Our use of TRSs may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.

﻿

The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and such undistributed TRS income is generally not subject to our REIT distribution requirements. However, if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities, taken together with other non-qualifying assets, to represent more than 25% of the fair market value of our assets, or causes the fair market value of our TRS securities alone to represent more than 25% (for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017) or 20% (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets, in each case, as determined for REIT asset testing purposes, we would, absent timely responsive action, fail to qualify as a REIT.

﻿

Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.

﻿

The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect our investors or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. New legislation, U.S. Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to our investors and us of such qualification.

﻿



Our Board’s ability to revoke our REIT qualification, without shareholder approval, may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders.

﻿

Our articles of incorporation provide that our Board of Directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our shareholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to be a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders, if any, in computing our taxable income, and to the extent we have taxable income and have utilized our NOLs, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders.

﻿

We do not have any experience operating as a REIT, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations.

﻿

While we believe that we are currently operating in a manner that complies with the REIT rules, we have not actually operated as a REIT previously. Our pre-REIT operating experience may not be sufficient to enable us to operate successfully as a REIT. In addition, we will be required to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to maintain our status as a REIT. As a result, we may incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we have not previously incurred, which could be significant, and our management and other personnel may need to devote additional time to comply with these rules and regulations and controls required for continued compliance with the Code. These costs and time commitments could be substantially more than we currently expect. Therefore, our historical combined consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of our future costs and performance as a REIT. If our performance is adversely affected, it could affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.

The

market price of our Class A common stock may not be indicative of how the market value

our

Class A common stock following our

REIT conversion because of the change in our organization from a taxable C corporation to a REIT. Although we do not currently anticipate commencing distributions until a future date, the stock price of REIT securities have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates as investors evaluate the annual yield from distributions on the entity’s common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments. In addition, the market price of our Class A common stock may be affected by the economic and market perception of REIT securities

as well as general market conditions

﻿

As a REIT, we

are

no longer eligible to be included in the NASDAQ 100 Index

. T

herefore, those index funds that invest in the equity of NASDAQ 100 companies will be required to sell our shares and not purchase them in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the volatility and market price of our Class A common stock.

﻿

One of the eligibility criteria for the NASDAQ 100 Index is that the company is not a financial company.  As a REIT, we

are

considered a financial company, even though our business model

has

not change

d

in connection with the REIT conversion; and therefore, we

are

no longer eligible to be included in the NASDAQ 100 Index.  As a result, those index funds that invest in NASDAQ 100 companies will be required to sell shares of our Class A common stock and not purchase them in the future.  In addition, other non-index funds that use inclusion on the NASDAQ 100 Index as a component of their investment criteria may be required to sell and no longer invest in our Class A common stock.  We do not know how many shares of our Class A common stock are held by these index and non-index funds.  The sales of significant amounts of shares of our Class A common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur could have an adverse effect on the volatility and market price of our Class A common stock.

﻿

Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.

﻿

The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to income from “qualified dividends” payable to U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is currently 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends. Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock.



Risks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock

The REIT-related ownership and transfer restrictions may restrict or prevent you from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock.

In order for us to satisfy the requirements for REIT qualification, no more than 50% in value of all classes or series of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be subject to tax as a REIT has been made). In addition, our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be taxed as a REIT has been made). Our articles of incorporation contain REIT-related ownership and transfer restrictions that generally restrict shareholders from owning more than 9.8%, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock, or 9.8% in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock. Under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limits. These ownership and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.

Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equity-related offerings.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, including sales by any selling shareholder, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.

Our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law provide for anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our Class A common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

We own our

headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida where we currently

have

approximately 160,000 square feet of office space.  We have entered into long-term leases for international

and

regional

locations convenient for the management and operation of our site leasing activities, and in

certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longer-term. We open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business. We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate.

Our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests, leasehold interests created by long-term lease agreements, perpetual easements, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and other similar interests. As of

December 31, 2016

, approximately

72%

of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years. The average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control,

is


years. In rural areas, support for our towers, equipment shelters, and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10,000 square feet. Less than 2,500 square feet is required for a monopole or self-supporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers. Ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years, for a total of thirty years or more.

Most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas. We measure the available capacity of our existing facilities to support additional tenants and generate additional lease revenue by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, wind loading, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had an average of

1.8

tenants per tower structure.

MANAGEMENT’S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications

infrastructure, including

tower structures, rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites.” Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in South America, Central America, and Canada. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed

98.7%

of our total segment operating profit for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. In our site leasing business, we (1) lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of

December 31, 2016

, we owned

26,197

towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. We also managed or leased approximately

5,500

actual or potential towers, approximately


of which were revenue producing as of

December 31, 2016

. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.



REIT Conversion

In October 2016, we announced our intention to take the necessary steps to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  We refer to this as the REIT conversion.  We believe that our business has been operated in a manner that complies with the REIT rules since January 1, 2016, and as a result, we intend to make the election to be subject to tax as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016.  Because we believe our business is currently operated in a manner that complies with the REIT rules, no further reorganization of our operations is necessary to complete the REIT conversion.

As part of the REIT conversion, effective January 1


, 2017, we completed the merger with our predecessor that was approved by our shareholders at a special meeting held

o

n January

12,

2017, and as a result of the merger, we now hold, directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, the assets held by our predecessor prior to the merger and conduct the existing businesses of our predecessor and its subsidiaries.  At the effective time of the merger, all outstanding shares of Class A common stock of our predecessor were converted into a right to receive an equal number of our shares of Class A common stock.  Although the REIT rules do not require the completion of this merger, we completed the merger to facilitate our compliance with the REIT rules by ensuring the effective adoption of certain REIT-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions related to our capital stock.

A REIT is a corporation that qualifies for special treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes because, among other things, it derives most of its income from real estate-based sources and makes a special election under the Code.  We operate as a REIT that principally invests in, and derives most of its income from the ownership, operation and leasing of, towers.  As a REIT, we generally will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of our net income that we distribute to our shareholders.  However, we will continue to pay U.S. federal income tax on earnings, if any, from assets and operations held through TRSs. These assets and operations currently consist primarily of our site development services and our international operations. Our international operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those operations are located. We may also be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local and foreign income, property and other taxes on our assets and operations.

As a REIT, we will generally be required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income after the utilization of any available NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our shareholders.  In addition to the REIT distribution requirements, our determination as to the timing and amount of future dividend distributions will be based on a number

of factors, including investment opportunities around our core business, the availability of our existing federal NOLs of approximately

$1.1

billion as of

December 31, 2016

that are attributes of the REIT,

our financial condition, earnings, debt covenants, and other possible uses of such funds.  We may use these NOLs to offset our REIT taxable income, and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such

time as the NOLs have been fully utilized.  We do not expect that we will be required to make any distribution of accumulated earnings and profits (commonly referred to as a “purging” dividend) in connection with our REIT conversion.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the United States, Canada, Central America, and South America. Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Oi S.A., Telefonica, Claro, and

TIM

. Wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site. In the United States and Canada, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. Tenant leases in our Central American and South American markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods. In Central America, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the United States and Canada while our leases in South America escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index.

Site leases in South America typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying ground lease rent.

In our Central American markets and Ecuador, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, most of our ground leases, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are due and paid in U.S. dollars. In our Central American markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. In our Brazilian, Canadian, and Chilean operations, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency.



Cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:

•

Rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests;

•

Straight-line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term (which may include renewal terms) of the underlying property interests;

•

Property taxes;

•

Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);

•

Utilities;

•

Property insurance; and

•

Deferred lease origination cost amortization.

Ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option

and provide for rent escalators which typically average 2-3% annually, or in our South American markets, adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index. As of

December 31, 2016

, approximately

72%

of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. For any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.

As indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 18 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

﻿

﻿

We believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements. During


, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to be consistent with our growth in


. We believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers

add or

upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue

other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of

a specific technology

(e.g. iDEN)

.

Site Development Services

Our site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to



wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. The market offices are responsible for all site development operations.

For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 18 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

Capital Allocation Strategy

Our capital allocation strategy is to prioritize investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value. A primary goal of our capital allocation strategy is to increase our Adjusted Funds From Operations per share. To achieve this, we expect we would continue to deploy capital between portfolio growth and stock repurchases, subject to compliance with REIT distribution requirements, available funds and market conditions, while maintaining our target leverage levels. Key elements of our capital allocation strategy include:

Portfolio Growth

.

We intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers.

Stock repurchase program

.

We currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below intrinsic value. After portfolio growth, we believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of increasing our Adjusted Funds From Operations per share.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, included herein. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally five to ten years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, we recognize the revenue related to that phase. Site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete. Amounts billed in advance (collected or uncollected) are recorded as deferred revenue on

our

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because



management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts,” included within other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable.

Asset Impairment

We evaluate individual long-lived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed. We evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists. We evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present. We have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment.

We record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible, we calculate future discounted cash flows and compare those amounts to the carrying value. We record an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value. Estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential, and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge.

Business Combinations

We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities we acquire are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with our results of operations from the dates of the respective acquisitions. We continue to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date. The intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date (“Current contract intangibles”) and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the communication sites (“Network location intangibles”) and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows. The intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related communication site assets, which is typically 15 years.

In connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to pay contingent consideration (or earnouts) in cash or stock if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired. We accrue for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. All subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recorded through Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 Business Combinations. The standard requires that the acquirer (1) recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, (2) record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, and (3) to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.

We

adopted ASU 2015-16 effective January 1, 2016. The financial statement impact of adopting this standard was not material for all periods presented.



In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The standard provides guidance to help entities determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard is required to be applied prospectively.

We are

evaluating the standard, including the impact on its consolidated financial statements

.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This report contains information regarding a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA. We have provided below a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure.

This report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the Oi reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2016.  We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year. We believe that excluding the Oi reserve, which represents a $16.5 million one-time bad debt provision for all amounts owed or potentially owed by Oi prior to the date of Oi’s June 2016 petition for judicial reorganization, provides management and investors the ability to better analyze our core results without the impact of what we believe is a non-recurring event.

Adjusted EBITDA

We define Adjusted EBITDA

as net income (loss) excluding

the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition related adjustments and expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, and provision for or benefit from taxes.

﻿

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to the 2014 Senior Notes and 2016 Senior Notes (defined below). Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SBAC is a holding company with no business operations of its own. SBAC’s only significant asset is

100% of

the outstanding capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, LLC (“Telecommunications”), which is also a holding company that owns equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly own all of our domestic and international towers and assets. We conduct all of our business operations through Telecommunications’ subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, other than financings, is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries.

A summary of our cash flows is as follows:

﻿

﻿

(1)

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company adopted an accounting standard update on the

presentation

of cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Cash Flows. The new

standard

requires cash and cash equivalent balances to include restricted cash equivalents. The December

31, 2015

and


consolidated statement

s

of cash flows w

ere

retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change.

﻿

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities was

$742.5

million for the year ended

December 31, 2016

as compared to

$723.0

million for the year ended

December 31, 2015

. The in

crease was primarily

due to

increase

s

in segment operating profit from domestic site leasing and international site leasing operating segments

,

partially offset by decreased site development segment operating profit,

increased selling, general, and administrative expenses,

and

increased cash interest payments relating to the higher average amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding

.



Investing Activities

A detail of our cash capital expenditures is as follows:

﻿

﻿

(1)

Excludes

$14.1

million,

$16.3

million, and

$10.8

million spent to extend ground lease terms for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


,

respectively.

﻿

Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we acquired 42 towers and related assets for $17.3 million in cash.

During fiscal year 2017, we expect to incur non-discretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of $31.0 million to $41.0 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures

, based on current acquisition obligations, planned new tower construction, forecasted tower augmentations, and forecasted ground lease purchases, of

$200.0

million to

$220.0

million as well as potential, additional tower acquisitions not yet under contract. We expect to fund these cash capital expenditures from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or new financings. The exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our

tower

portfolio, our new tower build and acquisition programs, and our ground lease purchase program.

Financing Activities

On January 12, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan, replacing the plan authorized on June 4, 2015 which had a remaining authorization of $150.0 million. This plan authorizes

us

to purchase, from time to time, up to $1.0 billion of

our

outstanding Class A common stock through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and/or in privately negotiated transactions at

management’s discretion based on market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. Shares purchased will be retired. The new plan has no time deadline and will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by

our

Board of Directors at any time in

its

sole discretion.

As of t

he date of this filing, we had

the full

$1.0

b

illion authorization remaining under our current stock repurchase program.

On July 7, 2016, we, through our existing SBA Tower Trust, issued $700.0 million of 2.877% Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2016-1C which have an anticipated repayment date of July 9, 2021 and a final maturity date of July 10, 2046 (the “2016-1C Tower Securities”). Net proceeds from this offering were used to prepay the full $550.0 million outstanding on the 2010-2C Tower Securities and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, we

expensed

$1.0 million of deferred financing fees related to the redemption of the 2010-2C Tower Securities.



On August 15, 2016, we issued $1.1 billion of unsecured senior notes due September 1, 2024 (the “2016 Senior Notes”). The 2016 Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.875% per annum and were issued at 99.178% of par value. Net proceeds from this offering and cash on hand were used to redeem $800.0 million, the aggregate principal amount outstanding, of Telecommunications’ 5.75% Senior Notes and $250.0 million of our 5.625% Senior Notes and pay the associated call premiums.

We also

pa

id

$25.8 million for the call premium and accrued interest on the redemption of the

5.75% Senior Note

s

and

expensed

$7.7 million of deferred financing fees related

to the redemption of the notes.

On October 1, 2016, we redeemed the 5.625% Senior Notes in full. On October 3, 2016, we repaid $500.0 million in outstanding principal, $14.1 million related to the call premium on the early redemption of the notes, and $14.1 million in accrued interest.  Repayment was made using (1) the proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes, (2) borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and (3) cash on hand. In addition, we

expensed

$4.1 million of deferred financing fees in connection with the extinguishment of the debt.

On January 20, 2017,

we

repr

iced our

senior secured term loans from a Eurodollar Rate plus 250 basis points (with a Eurodollar Rate floor of 0.75%) to a Eurodollar Rate plus 225 basis points (with

a zero Eurodollar

floor).

Registration Statements

We have on file with the Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 registering shares of Class A common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or antenna sites and related assets or companies who own wireless communication towers, antenna sites, or related assets. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we did not issue any shares of Class A common stock under this registration statement. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had approximately

1.7

million shares of Class A common stock remaining under this shelf registration statement.

On March 3, 2015, we filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers on Form S-3ASR. This registration statement enables us to issue shares of our Class A common stock, preferred stock or debt securities either separately or represented by warrants, or depositary shares as well as units that include any of these securities. Under the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements, we will file a prospectus supplement and advise the Commission of the amount and type of securities each time we issue securities under this registration statement. No shares were issued under this registration statement through the date of this filing.

Debt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements

Senior Credit Agreement

On February 7, 2014, SBA Senior Finance II entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things, incur the 2014 Term Loan and amend certain terms of the existing senior credit agreement (as amended, t

he “Senior Credit Agreement”).

Terms of the Senior Credit Agreement

The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, requires SBA Senior Finance II to maintain specific financial ratios, including (1) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA not to exceed 6.5 times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net Hedge Exposure (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.5 times for 30 consecutive days and (3) a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter. The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of SBA Senior Finance II and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of their property.

As of

December 31, 2016

, SBA Senior Finance II was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit Agreement.

The Senior Credit Agreement is also subject to customary events of default. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loans and certain hedging transactions that may be entered into by SBA Senior Finance II or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the membership interests of SBA Telecommunications, LLC, SBA Senior Finance, LLC and SBA Senior Finance II and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real property) of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary Guarantors.



The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, permits SBA Senior Finance II, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide SBA Senior Finance II with increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans provided that after giving effect to the proposed increase in Revolving Credit Facility commitments or incremental term loans the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA would not exceed 6.5 times. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans is subject to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and, with respect to any additional term loan, an increase in the margin on existing term loans to the extent required by the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon SBA Senior Finance II’s request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Facility commitment or whether to provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms.

Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement

T

he Revolving Credit Facility

is governed by the Senior Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility

consists of a revolving loan under which up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn,

based upon

specific financial ratios and

subject to

the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin that ranges from 137.5 basis points to 200.0 basis points or (ii) the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 37.5 basis points to 100.0 basis points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA, calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement. In addition, SBA Senior Finance II is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum on the amount of unused commitment. If not earlier terminated by SBA Senior Finance II, the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on, and SBA Senior Finance II will repay all amounts outstanding on or before, February 5, 2020. The proceeds available under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. SBA Senior Finance II may, from time to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of a period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.

During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we borrowed

$580.0

million and repaid

$190.0

million of the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility.

As of

December 31, 2016

,

$390.0

million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Subsequent to

December 31, 2016

, we repaid

$95.0

million of the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Term Loans und

er the

Senior Credit Agreement

Repricing Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement

On January 20, 2017, we amended our Senior Credit Agreement, primarily to reduce the stated rate of interest applicable to our senior secured term loans.  As amended, our senior secured term loans accrue interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either the Base Rate plus 125 basis points (with a zero Base Rate floor) or the Eurodollar Rate plus 225 basis points (with a zero Eurodollar Rate floor).

2014 Term Loan

The 2014 Term Loan consists of a senior secured term loan with an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion that matures on March 24, 2021.

Prior to the reduction in the term loan interest rates as discussed above, t

he 2014 Term Loan accrue

d

interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either the Base Rate plus


basis points (with a Base Rate floor of

1.75%

) or the Eurodollar Rate plus


basis points (with a Eurodollar Rate floor of

0.75%

).

The 2014 Term Loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. As of

December 31, 2016

, the 2014 Term Loan was accruing interest at

Secured Tower Revenue Securities

Tower Revenue Securities Terms

The mortgage loan underlying the 2012

-1C

Tower Securities, 2013 Tower Securities, 2014 Tower Securities, 2015

-1C

Tower Securities

, and 2016-1C Tower Securities

(together the “Tower Securities”) will be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate

10,535

tower sites owned by the Borrowers. The mortgage loan is secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust, and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower sites, (ii) a security interest in the tower sites and substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (iii) the Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases, and (iv) all of the proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar month, SBA Network Management, Inc., an indirect subsidiary (“Network Management”), is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 4.5% of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for

the immediately preceding calendar month.

The Borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (i)

within

twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

2012-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1D, Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-1C, Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2015-1C, and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2016-1C

) or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

2013-2C and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-2C) of the

anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component, (ii) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower owned by the Borrowers or (iii) during an amortization period. In all other circumstances, the Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. The prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the Tower Securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid, calculated in accordance with

the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement, on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date within twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

2012-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1D, Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-1C, Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2015-1C, and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2016-1C

) or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

2013-2C and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-2C) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment.

To the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (i) 5% and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.

Pursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the towers owned by the Borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are held by the indenture trustee. The monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as

short-term

restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 4). However, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other



payments required under the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead

of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. In addition, if any of the Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the towers owned by the Borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the Tower Securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the Tower Securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those towers, third to pay the management fees due to Network Management, fourth to repay principal of the Tower Securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above.

Furthermore, the advance rents reserve requirement states that the Borrowers are required to maintain an advance rents reserve at any time the monthly tenant Debt Service Coverage Ratio is equal to or less than 2:1 and for two calendar months after such coverage ratio again exceeds 2:1.

The mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Borrowers met the required Debt Service Coverage Ratio as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants

as set forth in the agreement

.

Debt Service

As of

December 31, 2016

, we believe that our cash on hand, capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility, and cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months.

Inflation

The impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. However, we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation other than our contracts in

South America

which have inflationary index based rental escalators.

Our current primary market risk exposure is (1)

interest rate risk relating to

our ability to refinance our debt at commercially reasonable rates, if at all,

and

(2) interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements on our 2014 Term Loan and 2015 Term Loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our Revolving Credit Facility, which are at floating rates. We manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt. While we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis.

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in Brazil, Canada,

and Chile, and to a lesser extent, our markets in Central America

. In each of these countries, we pay most of our selling,



general, and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses, such as taxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency. In addition, in Brazil

,

Canada,

and Chile,

we receive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our operating expenses in local currency. All transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period

,

and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, approximately

11.6%

of our revenues and approximately

14.9%

of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the Brazilian Real from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at

December 31, 2016

. As of

December 31, 2016

, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our revenues and operating

income

to fluctuate by

approximately

0.7%

and

2.0%

, respectively, for

the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had intercompany debt, which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As

settlement of

this debt

is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future

, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. A change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled

intercompany debt at

December 31, 2016

would have resulted in approximately

$42.0

million of unrealized gains or losses that would have been included in Other

income (

expense

), net

in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures –

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.



In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of

December 31, 2016

, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of

December 31, 2016

, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended

December 31, 2016

that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting –

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of SBAC; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of SBAC are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of SBAC; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of SBAC’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of SBAC’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

based upon criteria in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management determined that SBAC’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2016

based on the criteria in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013 Framework) issued by COSO.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on SBAC’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries

We have audited SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria e

stablished in Internal Control

Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financia

l reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies

or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2016

and


and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive

income

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT

REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive

income (

loss

), shareholders’ equity (deficit)

and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2016

. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Telecommunications is a holding company that holds the outstanding capital stock of SBA Senior Finance, LLC (“SBA Senior Finance”), and other operating subsidiaries which are not a party to any loan agreement. SBA Senior Finance is a holding company that holds, directly or indirectly, the equity interest in certain subsidiaries that issued the Tower Securities (see Note 12) and certain subsidiaries that were not involved in the issuance of the Tower Securities. With respect to the subsidiaries involved in the issuance of the Tower Securities, SBA Senior Finance is the sole member of SBA Holdings, LLC and SBA Depositor, LLC. SBA Holdings, LLC is the sole member of SBA Guarantor, LLC. SBA Guarantor, LLC directly or indirectly holds all of the capital stock of the companies referred to as the “Borrowers” under the Tower Securities. With respect to subsidiaries not involved in the issuance of the Tower Securities, SBA Senior Finance holds all of the membership interests in SBA Senior Finance II, LLC (“SBA Senior Finance II”) and certain non-operating subsidiaries. SBA Senior Finance II holds, directly or indirectly, all the capital stock of certain international subsidiaries and certain other tower companies (known as “Tower Companies”). SBA Senior Finance II also holds, directly or indirectly, all the capital stock and/or membership interests of certain other subsidiaries involved in providing services, including SBA Network Services, LLC (“Network Services”) as well as SBA Network Management, Inc. (“Network Management”) which manages and administers the operations of the Borrowers.

In October 2016,

the Company

announced

its

intention to take the necessary steps to qualify as a

Real Estate Investment Trust (“

REIT

”)

for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

This is

refer

red to

as the REIT conversion.

The Company

believe

s

that

its

business has been operated in a manner that complies with the REIT rules since January 1, 2016, and as a result, intend

s

to make the election to be subject to tax as a REIT commencing with

its

taxable year ending December 31, 2016. Because

the Company

believe

s

its

business is currently operated in a manner that complies with the REIT rules, no further reorganization of

its

operations is necessary to complete the REIT conversion. As part of the REIT conversion, effective January 1


, 2017,

the Company

completed the merger with

its

predecessor that was approved by

its

sharehol

ders at a special meeting held o

n January

12,

2017, and as a result of the merger,

the Company

now hold

s

, directly or indirectly through

its

subsidiaries, the assets held by

its

predecessor prior to the merger and conduct

s

the existing businesses of

its

pr

edecessor and its subsidiaries.

Although the REIT rules do not require the completion of this merger,

the Company

completed the merger to facilitate

its

compliance with the REIT rules by ensuring the effective adoption of certain REIT-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions

related to our capital stock.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company owned and operated wireless towers in the United States and its territories. In addition, the Company owned towers in Brazil, Canada,

Chile,

Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama. Space on these towers is leased primarily to wireless service providers. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company owned and operated

26,197

towers of which

15,922

are domestic and

10,275

are international.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as follows:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the Company and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made by management relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the costs and revenue relating to the Company’s construction contracts, stock-based compensation assumptions, valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, fair value of long-lived assets, the useful lives of towers and intangible assets, anticipated property tax assessments, fair value of investments and asset retirement obligations. Management develops estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available. These estimates ultimately may differ from actual results and such differences could be material.

F-



Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash in banks, money market funds, commercial paper

,

highly liquid short-term investments,

and

other marketable securities

with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Restricted Cash

The Company classifies all cash pledged as collateral to secure certain obligations and all cash whose use is limited as restricted cash. This includes cash held in escrow to fund certain reserve accounts relating to the Tower Securities as well as for payment and performance bonds and surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company in the ordinary course of business

, as well as collateral associated with workers’ compensation plans

(see Note 4).

Investments

Investment securities with original maturities of more than three months but less than one year at time of purchase are considered short-term investments. The Company’s short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of less than a year. Investment securities with maturities of more than a year are considered long-term investments and are classified in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Long-term investments primarily consist of U.S. Treasuries, mutual funds, and preferred securities. Gross purchases and sales of the Company’s investments are presented within “Cash flows from investing activities” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company accounts for its investments in privately held companies under the cost-method as it does not exert significant influence. The Company evaluates its cost-method investments for impairment at least annually. The Company determines the fair value of its cost-method investments by considering available evidence, including general market conditions, the investee’s financial condition, near-term prospects, market comparables and subsequent rounds of financing. The Company measures and records its cost-method investments at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company did

not

recognize any impairment loss associated with its cost-method investments during the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


.

During the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company received proceeds related to the sale or maturity of investments of

$0.7

million and

$89.7

million, respectively, and recorded

a

gain of

$38.3

million

in the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2016

,

no

gain or loss was recorded related to the sale or maturity of investments.

The proceeds are reflected in Net cash used in investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and the related gain

or loss

on sale or maturity is reflected in Other

income

(expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. The aggregate carrying value of the Company’s investments was approximately

$8.1

million and

$8.8

million as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, and is classified within

short-term investments and

other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost or at estimated fair value (in the case of acquired properties), adjusted for asset impairment and estimated asset retirement obligations. Costs for self-constructed towers include direct materials and labor, indirect costs and capitalized interest. Approximately

$1.0

million,

$0.8

million, and

$0.3

million of interest cost was capitalized in


,


and


, respectively.

Depreciation on towers and related components is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, not to exceed the minimum lease term of the underlying ground lease. The Company defines the minimum lease term as the shorter of the period from lease inception through the end of the term of all tenant lease obligations in existence at ground lease inception, including renewal periods, or the ground lease term, including renewal periods. If no tenant lease obligation exists at the date of ground lease inception, the initial term of the ground lease is considered the minimum lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the minimum lease term of the lease. For all other property and equipment, depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.

The Company performs ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset. If the useful lives of assets are reduced, depreciation may be accelerated in future years. Property and equipment under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or the remaining estimated life of the leased property, whichever is shorter, and the related amortization is included in depreciation expense. Expenditures for maintenance and repair are expensed as incurred.

F-



Asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows:

﻿

﻿

Betterments, improvements, and significant repairs, which increase the value or extend the life of an asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset. Changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively,

with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life. There has been no material impact for changes in estimated useful lives for any years presented.

Deferred Financing Fees

Financing fees related to the issuance of debt have been deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the expected duration of the related indebtedness (see Note 12).

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2015-03, Interest—Imputation of Interest. The standard requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016 and reclassified $90.2 million from deferred financing fees, net to long-term debt in the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest - Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. The standard indicates the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) staff would not object to presenting debt issuance costs for a line of credit arrangement as an asset in the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASU 2015-15 effective January 1, 2016 and has elected to continue to present debt issuance costs for its Revolving Credit Facility as an asset on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Deferred Lease Costs

The Company defers certain initial direct costs associated with the origination of tenant leases and lease amendments and amortizes these costs over the initial lease term or over the lease term remaining if related to a lease amendment. Such deferred costs were approximately

$10.2

million,

$10.9

million, and

$12.4

million in


,


, and


, respectively. Amortization expense was

$11.3

million,

$9.0

million, and

$6.8

million for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively, and is included in cost of site leasing on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, unamortized deferred lease costs were

$29.7

million and

$30.6

million, respectively, and are included in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Intangible Assets

The Company classifies as intangible assets the fair value of current leases in place at the acquisition date of towers and related assets (referred to as the “Current contract intangibles”), and the fair value of future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the acquired towers (referred to as the “Network location intangibles”). These intangibles are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related tower assets, which is typically


years. For all intangible assets, amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as the benefit associated with these intangible assets is anticipated to be derived evenly over the life of the asset.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates its individual long-lived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed. The Company evaluates its tower assets and Current contract intangibles at the tower level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists. The Company evaluates its Network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present. The Company has established a policy to at least annually evaluate its tower assets and Current contract intangibles for impairment.

The Company records an impairment charge when the Company believes an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and

F-



related intangible, the Company calculates future discounted cash flows and compares those amounts to the carrying value. The Company records an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value. Estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, the Company makes certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge.

The Company recognized impairment charges of

$30.2

million,

$94.8

million, and

$23.8

million for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively. Refer to Note 3 for further detail of these amounts.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair market values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally

five

to

ten

years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Site development projects in which the Company performs consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which the Company performs work on a fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, the Company recognizes the revenue related to that phase. Site development projects generally take from


to


months to complete. Amounts billed in advance (collected or uncollected) are recorded as deferred revenue on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts,” included within other current liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers. The Company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable.

F-



The following is a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts:

﻿

﻿

On June 20, 2016, Oi, S.A. (“Oi”), the Company’s largest customer in Brazil, filed a petition for judicial reorganization in Brazil. Prior to the filing of the reorganization petition, Oi was current in all payment obligations to the Company. These obligations related to periods ending on or before April 30, 2016. As a result of the relief provisions available in a judicial reorganization proceeding, obligations of Oi to the Company arising from the periods from May 1, 2016 to June 20, 2016 remain unpaid. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of amounts owed by Oi relating to services provided prior to the date of Oi’s petition, the Company has recorded a

$16.5

million bad debt provision (the “Oi reserve”) which covers amounts owed or potentially owed by Oi as of the filing date. Under Brazilian law governing judicial reorganizations, the contracts governing post-petition obligations such as tower rents remain unchanged, and debtors do not have the ability to reject or terminate the contracts other than pursuant to their original terms. Since the filing, the Company has received all

rental

payments due in connection with obligations of Oi accruing post-petition. The Oi reserve has been recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expense on the

consolidated statement of o

perations.

﻿

Cost of Revenue

Cost of site leasing revenue includes ground lease rent, property taxes, amortization of deferred lease costs, maintenance and other tower operating expenses. All ground lease rental obligations due to be paid out over the lease term, including fixed escalations, are recorded on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. Liabilities recorded related to the straight-lining of ground leases are reflected in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of site development revenue includes the cost of materials, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects. All costs related to site development projects are recognized as incurred.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is "more-likely-than-not" that those assets will not be realized. The Company  considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization, including the Company's recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that are available, the carryforward periods available to the Company for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.

The Company began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2016.

As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income it distributes to its stockholders as long as it meets the organizational and operational requirements under the REIT rules. However, certain subsidiaries have made an election with the IRS to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) in conjunction with the Company's REIT election. The TRS elections permit SBA to engage in certain business activities in which the REIT may not engage directly, so long as these activities are conducted in entities that elect to be treated as TRSs under the Internal Revenue Code.  A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes on the income from these activities. Additionally, the Company has included in TRSs our tower operations in most foreign jurisdictions; however, the REIT holds selected tower assets in Puerto Rico and USVI. Those operations will continue to be subject to foreign taxes in the jurisdiction in which such assets and operations are located regardless of whether they are included in a TRS.

For the tax

year ended

December 31, 2016

,

the Company will file separate federal tax returns for the REIT and TRS.

The REIT had taxable income and utilized net operating losses (“NOLs”) to offset its distribution requirement. The TRS generated a NOL which will be carried forward to use in future years. Prior to the REIT conversion in 2016, the Company filed consolidated returns and had taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and utilized NOL carry-forwards. These NOL carry-forwards are retained by the REIT. The NOLs generated by the TRS in the current year are fully reserved by a valuation allowance.

F-



The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company has not identified any tax exposures that require a reserve. To the extent that the Company records unrecognized tax exposures, any related interest and penalties will be recognized as interest expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company does not calculate U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. The Company records compensation expense, for stock options and restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense for employee stock options is based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Any stock options granted to non-employees would be valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the market price of the underlying common stock on the “valuation date,” which for options to non-employees is the vesting date. Expense related to options granted to non-employees would be recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period. Compensation expense for restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of the units awarded at the date of the grant.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which the Company adopted as of January 1, 2016. The standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for shared-based payment transactions including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, classification of awards as either equity or a liability, and classification on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The financial statement impact of adopting this standard was not material for all periods presented.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company has entered into ground leases for the land underlying the majority of the Company’s towers. A majority of these leases require the Company to restore land interests to their original condition upon termination of the ground lease.

The Company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and accretes such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets, and over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the tower.

The asset retirement obligation is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon settlement of the obligations, any difference between the cost to retire an asset and the recorded liability is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain or loss. In determining the measurement of the asset retirement obligations, the Company considered the nature and scope of the contractual restoration obligations contained in the Company’s third party ground leases, the historical retirement experience as an indicator of future restoration probabilities, intent in renewing existing ground leases through lease termination dates, current and future value and timing of estimated restoration costs and the credit adjusted risk-free rate used to discount future obligations.

The following summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation liability:

﻿

F-



Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, and is comprised of net income (loss) and other foreign currency adjustments.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for the Company’s Central American subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries which are not denominated in U.S. dollars are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are remeasured at monthly average rates prevailing during the year. Unrealized translation gains and losses are reported as other income/expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that do not utilize the U.S. dollar as its functional currency are translated at period-end rates of exchange, while revenues and expenses are translated at monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Unrealized translation gains and losses are reported as foreign currency translation adjustments through accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ deficit.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. The Company continues to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed

one

year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date. The intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date (“Current contract intangibles”) and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the towers (“Network location intangibles”) and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows. The intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related tower assets, which is typically


years.

In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company may agree to pay contingent consideration (or earnouts) in cash or stock if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of

one

to

three

years after they have been acquired. The Company accrues for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. All subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable in cash are recorded through Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 Business Combinations. The standard requires that the acquirer (1) recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, (2) record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortiz

ation, or other income effects

, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, and (3) to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The Company adopted

this standard

prospectively

effective January 1, 2016. The financial statement impact of adopting this stand

ard was not material for any period

presented.

Cash Flows

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to decrease the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The standard requires that (1) cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, (2) contingent consideration payments made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination be classified as cash outflows for investing activities,

and

(3) contingent consideration payments not made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination be separated with cash payments up to the amount of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date be classified as financing activities and any excess be classified as operating activities. The Company adopted

the standard retrospectively

effective January 1, 2016. The financial statement impact of adopting this standard was not material for a

ny

period presented.

F-



In

November

2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-


,

Statement of Cash Flows

. The standard requires cash and cash equivalent balances to include restricted cash equivalents.

The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2016. Prior year periods have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation.

Intercompany Loans

On November 25, 2014, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, Brazil Shareholder I, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and SBA Torres Brasil, Limitada, a limitada existing under the laws of the Republic of Brazil, entered into an intercompany loan agreement where from time to time the entities may agree to lend/borrow amounts up to

$750.0

million. As of

December 31, 2016

, the outstanding balance under this agreement was

$433.3

million.

In accordance with ASC 830, the Company remeasures foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in Other income (expenses), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations

as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future

. For the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


,

the Company recorded

a

$90.0

gain, a

$178.9

million

loss

and a

$23.0

million loss,

respectively, on the remeasurement of intercompany loans

due to changes in foreign exchange rates

.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB released an updated standard regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, exclusive of those contracts within lease accounting. The core principle of the standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contracts with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the contract price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This standard is effective in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted but not before the first quarter of 2017. This standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or with the cumulative effect being recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is evaluating the standard and does not expect a material financial statement impact upon adoption since the standard only affects our site development segment which represents approximately 6% of our total revenues.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments for all leases with a term greater than 12 months. The accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged from existing guidance. This standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has established a cross functional project plan to assess the impact of the standard, expects this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet due to the addition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases with a term greater than 12 months, and continues to assess additional impacts to its consolidated financial statements, including the consolidated statement of operations.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The standard provides guidance to help entities determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard is required to be applied prospectively. The Company is evaluating the standard, including the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

— The Company’s earnout

liabilities

related to acquisitions are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs

and are recorded in Accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in estimate are recorded in Acquisition related adjustments and expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations

. The Company determines the fair value of acquisition-related

earnouts (

contingent consideration

)

and any subsequent changes in fair value using a discounted probability-weighted approach using Level 3 inputs.

Level 3 valuations rely on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.

The fair value of the earnouts is reviewed quarterly and is based on the payments the Company expects to make based on historical internal observations related to the anticipated performance of the underlying assets. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of its obligation contained in various acquisition

s

was

$4.1

million and

$7.2

million as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. The

F-



maximum potential obligation related to the performance targets was

$5.8

million and

$10.2

million as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.

﻿

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

— The Company’s long-lived assets, intangibles, and asset retirement obligations are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs.

T

he Company considers many factors and makes certain assumptions when making this assessment, including but not limited to: general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. The fair value of the long-lived assets, intangibles, and asset retirement obligations is calculated using a discounted cash flow model.

﻿

Asset impairment and decommission costs for all periods presented and the related impaired assets

primarily

relate to the Company’s site leasing operating segment.

The following summarizes the activity of asset impairment and decommission costs

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash,

accounts payable, and short-term investments approximate their estimated fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments. Short-term investments consisted of

$0.5

million in certificate of deposits as of

December 31,


,

and

$0.2

million in Treasury securities as of

December 31, 2016

and


. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of its held-to-maturity investments in treasury and corporate bonds, including current portion, are based primarily upon Level 1 reported market values. As of

December 31, 2016

, the carrying value and fair value of the

long-term

investments, including current portion, were

$0.7

million. As of

December 31, 2015

, the carrying value and fair value of the

long-term

investments, including current portion, was

$0.8

million and

$0.9

million, respectively.

These amounts are recorded in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company determines fair value of its debt instruments utilizing various Level 2 sources including quoted prices and indicative quotes (non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices. The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility is considered to approximate the carrying value because the interest payments are based on Eurodollar rates that reset every month. The Company does not believe its credit risk has changed materially from the date the applicable Eurodollar Rate plus

RESTRICTED CASH

The cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances on the consolidated statement of cash flows

consists of the following

:

﻿

Restricted cash consists of the following:

﻿

﻿

Pursuant to the terms of t

he Tower Securities (see Note 12

), the Company is required to establish a securitization escrow account, held by the indenture trustee, into which all rents and other sums due on the towers that secure the Tower Securities are directly deposited by the lessees. These restricted cash amounts are used to fund reserve accounts for the payment of (1) debt service costs, (2) ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums related to towers, (3) trustee and servicing expenses,

and

(4) mana

gement fees

. The restricted cash in the securitization escrow account in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 1


) monthly, provided that the Borrowers are in compliance with their debt service coverage ratio and that no event of default has occurred.

All monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Payment and performance bonds relate primarily to collateral requirements for tower construction currently in process by the Company. Cash is pledged as collateral related to surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business and primarily related to the Company’s tower removal obligations. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company had

$39.2

million in surety, payment and performance bonds for which it is only required to post

$0.5

million in collateral. As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company had

$38.6

million in surety, payment and performance bonds for which it is only required to post

$0.7

million in collateral. The Company periodically evaluates the collateral posted for its bonds to ensure that it meets the minimum requirements. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company had also pledged

$2.5

million as collateral related to its workers compensation policy.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, total revenue for this acquisition was

$4.8

million.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014,

in addition to the Oi S.A. acquisitions, the Company acquired


completed towers and related assets and liabilities for

$403.2

million in cash.

The Company evaluates all acquisitions after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption, as well as the separate recognition of intangible assets from goodwill if certain criteria are met.

F-



The estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to

one

year from the particular acquisition date). The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration and any related tax impact. The fair values of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. During the measurement period, the Company will adjust assets and/or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in a revised estimated value of those assets and/or liabilities as of that date. The effect of material measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values is

recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined and calculated

as if the adjustments had been completed

at

the acquisition date. The impact of all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could be subject to a possible impairment of the

intangible assets, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets in subsequent periods.

Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company acquired


towers and related assets for

$17.3

million in cash.

Foreign Currency Forward Contract

On March

26, 2014, the Company settled  two foreign currency contracts entered into during the quarter with an aggregate notional amount of R$

1,525.0

million in order to hedge the purchase price of the Oi S.A. acquisition in Brazil, which closed on March 31, 2014. The Company realized a gain of

$17.9

million related to these foreign currency forward contracts which is included in other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Net cash used in investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

On September 29, 2014, the Company executed put and call option contracts settling on November 25, 2014 which created a “costless collar” based on the cost to purchase

$1.17

billion Brazilian Reais with US Dollars. The options were intended to limit exposure to movements in the related exchange rates and were entered into in contemplation of the purchase of the Oi S.A. acquisition that closed on December 1, 2014. These options created a floor price for the purchase of Brazilian Reais of

2.4

and a ceiling price of

2.5665

. Since the closing price was within the floor and ceiling price, no gain or loss was realized.

The Company measures its foreign currency forward contracts, which are recorded in Prepaid and other current assets, at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets (Level 2 inputs). These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and as such any gains and losses are reflected within Other Income, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company does not have any pending forward contracts.

Senior Credit Agreement

On February 7, 2014, SBA Senior Finance II entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things, incur the 2014 Term Loan and amend certain terms of the existing senior credit agreement (as amended,

the “Senior Credit Agreement”).

Terms of the Senior Credit Agreement

The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, requires SBA Senior Finance II to maintain specific financial ratios, including (1) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA not to exceed

6.5

times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net Hedge Exposure (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed

6.5

times for


consecutive days and (3) a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than

2.0

times for any fiscal quarter. The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of SBA Senior Finance II and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of their property.

As of

December 31, 2016

, SBA Senior Finance II was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit Agreement.

The Senior Credit Agreement is also subject to customary events of default. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loans and certain hedging transactions that may be entered into by SBA Senior Finance II or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the membership interests of SBA Telecommunications, LLC, SBA Senior Finance, LLC and SBA Senior Finance II and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real property) of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary Guarantors.

F-



The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, permits SBA Senior Finance II, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide SBA Senior Finance II with increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans provided that after giving effect to the proposed increase in Revolving Credit Facility commitments or incremental term loans the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA would not exceed 6.5 times. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans is subject to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and, with respect to any additional term loan, an increase in the margin on existing term loans to the extent required by the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon SBA Senior Finance II’s request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Facility commitment or whether to provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms.

Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement

T

he Revolving Credit Facility

is governed by the Senior Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility

consists of a revolving loan under which up to

$1.0

billion aggregate principal amount may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn,

based upon

specific financial ratios and

subject to

the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin that ranges from

137.5

basis points to

200.0

basis points or (ii) the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from

37.5

basis points to

100.0

basis points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA, calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement. In addition, SBA Senior Finance II is required to pay a commitment fee of

0.25%

per annum on t

he amount of unused commitment.

If not earlier terminated by SBA Senior Finance II, the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on, and SBA Senior Finance II will repay all amounts outstanding on or before, February 5, 2020

.

The proceeds available under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. SBA Senior Finance II may, from time to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of a period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.

of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.

The Borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (i) within

twelve

months (in the case of the component corresponding to the Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2012-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series


-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series


-1D, Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series


-1C, Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2015-1C, and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

) or

eighteen

months (in the case of the components corresponding to the

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

2013-2C and

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component, (ii) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower owned by the Borrowers or (iii) during an amortization period. In all other circumstances, the Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. The prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the Tower Securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid, calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement, on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date within twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2012-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1D, Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-1C, Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2015-1C, and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2016-1C

) or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

2013-2C and

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-2C

) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment.

To the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (i)

5%

and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the

ten

-year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z)

5%

, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.

Pursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the towers owned by the Borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are held by the indenture trustee. The monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as

short-term

restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 4). However, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to

1.30x

or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio falls below

1.15x

as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. In addition, if any of the Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the towers owned by the Borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the Tower Securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the Tower Securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those towers, third to pay the management fees due to Network Management, fourth to repay principal of the Tower Securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above.

Furthermore,

the advance rents reserve requirement

states

that the Borrowers

are

required to maintain an advance rents reserve at any time the monthly tenant

atio is equal to or less than

2:1

and for two calendar months after such coverage ratio again exceeds 2:1.

The mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Borrowers met the required Debt Service Coverage Ratio as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants as set forth in the agreement.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company

has

two

equity participation plans (the 2001 Equity Participation Plan and the 2010 Performance and Equity Incentive Plan, the “2010 Plan”) whereby options (both non-qualified and incentive stock options), restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and other equity and performance based instruments may be granted to directors, employees, and consultants. The options and restricted stock units generally vest from the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the vesting term and generally have a

seven

-year or a

ten

-year contractual life.

Upon the adoption of the 2010 Plan by the Company’s shareholders on May 6, 2010, the 2001 Equity Participation Plan was terminated and the Company is

Stock Options

The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses a combination of historical data and historical volatility to establish the expected volatility. Historical data is used to estimate the expected option life. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2008 Purchase Plan”) which reserved

500,000

shares of Class A common stock for purchase. The 2008 Purchase Plan permits eligible employee participants to purchase Class A common stock at a price per share which is equal to

85%

of the fair market value of Class A common stock on the last day of an offering period.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

31,165

shares of Class A common stock were issued under the 2008 Purchase Plan, which resulted in cash proceeds to the Company of approximately

$2.7

INCOME TAXES

As discussed in Note 2, the Company began operating in compliance with REIT requirements for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2016.  As a REIT, the Company must distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income (including dividends paid to it by its TRSs) except to the extent offset by

NOLs

.  In addition, the Company must meet a number of other organizational and operational requirements. It is management's intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the Company's REIT status. Most states where SBA operates conform to the federal rules recognizing REITs. Certain subsidiaries have made an election with the Company to be treated as TRSs in conjunction with the Company's REIT election; the TRS elections permit SBA to engage in certain business activities in which the REIT may not engage directly.  A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes on the

income from these activities.

A provision for taxes of the TRSs and of foreign branches of the REIT are included in its consolidated financial statements.

Income (loss) before provision for income taxes by geographic area is as follows:

﻿

The provision for income taxes consists of the following components:

﻿

F-



A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the statutory U.S. Federal tax rate (

35%

) and the effective income tax rate is as follows:

﻿

The components of the net deferred income tax asset (liability) accounts are as follows:

﻿

(1)

Of these amounts, $774 and $27,447 are included in Other assets and Other long-term liabilities, respectively on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, $619 and $25,795 are included in Other assets and Other long-term liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.

A deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of all available evidence

,

it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the value of such assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence, including both positive and negative evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. All sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies, should be considered.

F-



The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of its deferred tax assets as management believes that it is not “more-likely-than-not” that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to recognize the assets. Valuation allowances

of $70.2

million

and

$292.9

million were being carried to offset net deferred income tax assets as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. The net

change

in the valuation allowance for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


was

$(222.6)

million and

$25.6

million, respectively.

As a result of the REIT conversion, the Company has reversed net deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance of the subsidiaries included in the REIT in the amount of $205.3 million.

The Company has available at

December 31, 2016

, a

federal

NOL

carry-forward of

approximately

$1.2

billion. These

NOL

carry-forwards will expire between


and


.

As of

December 31, 2016

,

$1.1

billion of the federal NOL

s

are attributes of the REIT

.

The Company may use these NOLs to offset its REIT taxable income, and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the NOLs have been fully utilized.

The Internal Revenue Code places limitations upon the future availability of

NOLs

based upon changes in the equity of the Company. If these occur, the ability of the Company to offset future income with existing

NOLs

may be limited. In addition, the Company has available at

December 31, 2016

, a foreign

NOL

carry-forward of

$66.6

million and a net state operating tax loss carry-forward of approximately

$502.0

million. These net operating tax loss carry-forwards begin to expire in


.

The U.S. tax losses generated in tax years 1999 through 2013 remain subject to adjustment, and tax years 2013 through 2016 are open to examination by the major jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

The Company does not expect

to remit earnings from its foreign subsidiaries. Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately

$92.8

million at

December 31, 2016

.

$60.3 million of these

earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested

;

accordingly,

no

U.S. Federal and

state income taxes have been provided thereon.

It is not practicable to compute the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed foreign earnings.

Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company could be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.

As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09 during 2016.  Prior to 2016,

no

tax benefit was recognized in equity related to equity-based compensation as our excess tax benefits did not reduce taxes payable.  During 2016, we recognized $27.3

27.3

million

of excess tax deductions in our income tax provision that are ultimately offset with a valuation allowance at the TRS for no net benefit.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

The Company is obligated under various non-cancelable operating leases for land, office space, equipment and site leases that expire at various times through

December 2152

. In addition, the Company is obligated under various non-cancelable capital leases for vehicles that expire at various times through

August 2020

.

The annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases

for the next five years

as of

December 31, 2016

are as follows (in thousands):

﻿

﻿

Future minimum rental payments under noncancelable ground leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the Company’s option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower and related revenue from tenant leases,

F-



thereby making it reasonably assured that the Company will renew the lease. The majority of operating leases provide for renewal at varying escalations. Fixed rate escalations have been included in the table disclosed above.

Rent expense for operating leases was

$253.7

million,

$239.8

million and

$223.4

million for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively. In addition, certain of the Company’s leases include contingent rent provisions which provide for the lessor to receive additional rent upon the attainment of certain tower operating results and/or lease-up. Contingent rent expense for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


was

$25.0

million,

$24.4

million and

$23.3

million, respectively.

Tenant Leases

The annual minimum tower lease income to be received for tower space and antenna rental under non-cancelable operating leases

for the next five years

as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

The Company’s tenant leases provide for annual escalations and multiple renewal periods, at the tenant’s option. The tenant rental payments disclosed in the table above do not assume exercise of tenant renewal options, however, fixed rate escalations have been included.

Litigation

The Company is involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such matters and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs that may be incurred, management believes the resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Contingent Purchase Obligations

From time to time, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration (or earnouts) for acquisitions if the towers or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets in the

one

to

three

years after they have been acquired. For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


certain earnings targets associated with the acquired towers were achieved, and therefore, the Company paid in cash

$5.7

million,

$4.1

million, and

$18.7

million, respectively. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company’s estimate of its potential obligation if the performance targets contained in various acquisition agreements were met was

$4.1

million which the Company recorded in accrued expenses. The maximum potential obligation related to the performance targets was

$5.8

million and

$10.2

million as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.



.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The Company has a defined contribution profit sharing plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code that provides for voluntary employee contributions up to the limitations set forth in Section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Employees have the opportunity to participate following completion of three months of employment and must be 21 years of age.

Employer matching begins immediately upon the employee’s participation in the plan.

The Company makes

a discretionary matching contribution of

75%

of an employee’s contributions up to a maximum of

$4,000

annually. Company matching contributions were approximately

$2.0

million,

$2.1

million and

$2.0

million for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.

SEGMENT DATA

The Company operates principally in

two

business segments: site leasing and site development.

The Company’s site leasing business includes

two

reportable segments, domestic site leasing and international site leasing.

The Company’s

business

segments are

F-



strategic business units that offer different services. They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations. The site leasing segment includes results of the managed and sublease businesses. The site development segment includes the results of both consulting and construction related activities.

The Company’s

Chief Operating Decision Maker utilizes segment operating profit and operating income as his two measures of segment profit in assessing performance and allocating resources at the reportable segment level.

Revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, accretion and amortization), capital expenditures (including assets acquired through the issuance of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock) and identifiable assets pertaining to the segments in which the Company continues to operate are presented below:

F-



﻿

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (unaudited)

﻿

﻿

Basic and diluted net

income (

loss

)

per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares for the period. Potentially dilutive instruments have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.

Because

net income (

loss

)

per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total loss per share amounts for the year.


.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for each respective period. Diluted earnings per share was calculated by dividing net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number

F-



of shares of Common Stock outstanding and any dilutive Common Stock equivalents, including unvested restricted stock and shares issuable upon exercise of stock options as determined under the “If-Converted” method and also Common Stock warrants as determined under the “Treasury Stock” method.

The following table sets forth basic and diluted net income per common share for the

years

ended

,


,

and


(in thousands, except per share data):

For the

year

ended

December 31, 2016

, the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding excluded an additional

2.2

million shares issuable upon exercise of the Company’s stock options because the impact would be anti-dilutive.

For the

year ended December 31,


, all potential common stock equivalents, including

3.8

million shares of stock options outstanding and

0.3

million shares of restricted stock units outstanding, were excluded as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

For the

year ended December 31,


, all potential common stock equivalents, including

3.3

million shares of stock options outstanding and

0.3
