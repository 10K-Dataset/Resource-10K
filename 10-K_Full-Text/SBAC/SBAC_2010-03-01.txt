ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers. Our principal operations are in the continental United
States. In addition, we have towers in Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our principal business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 97.4% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended December 31,
2009. In our site leasing business, we lease antenna space primarily to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own, manage or lease from others. The towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a
wireless service provider, constructed based on our own initiative or acquired. As of December 31, 2009, we owned 8,324 tower sites, the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like
us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. We also manage or lease approximately 5,100 actual or potential communications sites, approximately 550 of which were revenue producing as of December 31, 2009.
Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on
our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts. Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless.
Wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site. Tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5-year renewal
periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3%–4% per year, including the renewal option periods.

In our new build program, we construct towers in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under build-to-suit arrangements. Under
build-to-suit arrangements, we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified. We retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to co-locate additional tenants on the tower. When we construct towers in
locations chosen by us, we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need, or will need, to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands. We
seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete pre-construction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts. We intend to have at least one signed tenant lease on each new build tower on the day
that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants. We intend to build at least 120 - 140 new towers during 2010.

In our tower acquisition program, we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns. For each acquisition, we prepare various analyses that include projections of a five-year
unlevered internal rate of return, review of available capacity, future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenant/technology mix.



The table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower sites
portfolio over the past three years.

(1)

2008 includes 528 towers acquired in the Optasite acquisition, 423 towers acquired in the Tower Co. acquisition and 340 towers acquired in the Light Tower acquisition.

(2)

Reclassifications reflect the combination for reporting purposes of multiple tower structures on a single parcel of real estate, which we market and customers view as a
single location, into a single owned tower site. Dispositions reflect the decommissioning, sale, conveyance or other legal transfer of owned tower sites.

As of December 31, 2009, we had an average of 2.5 tenants per tower.

Our
site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. Our site leasing business generated 85.9% of our total revenues during the past year and has represented 95.5% or more of our total segment operating profit for
the past three years.

Site Development Services

Our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business, and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our
site leasing revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Our site development business consists of two segments, site development
consulting and site development construction. Site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management
services to wireless service providers. We principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise, specifically site acquisition, zoning, technical services and construction.

In the consulting segment of our site development business, we offer clients the following range of services: (1) network pre-design;
(2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; and (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits. In the construction segment of
our site development business we provide a number of services, including, but not limited to the following: (1) tower and related site construction; (2) antenna installation; and (3) radio equipment installation, commissioning and
maintenance. Personnel in our site development business also support our leasing and new tower build functions through an integrated plan across the divisions.



We provide our site development consulting and construction services on a local basis,
through regional offices, territory offices and project offices. The regional offices are responsible for all site development operations, including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices, and a substantial portion of the sales in
such area.

For financial information about our operating segments, please see Note 23 of our Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Form 10-K.

Industry Overview

We believe that growing wireless traffic, the successful recent spectrum auctions and technology developments will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase
their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of communication sites that they use or the number of antennas at existing communication sites. First, consumers continue to increase minutes of use, whether through wireline to wireless
migration, increasing use of broadband services, new data products or simply talking more. Consumers are demanding quality wireless networks, and list network coverage and quality as two of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when
terminating or changing service. To decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth, wireless carriers have made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage. Second, we expect that the
roll-out of 3G and 4G wireless services by existing carriers will require our customers to add a large number of additional cell sites and increase the amount of their equipment at current cell sites. The Federal Communications Commission’s
(the “FCC”) successful advanced wireless service spectrum auction 66 for advanced broadband services and the more recent FCC spectrum auction 73, relating to the auction of the 700 MHz band, have provided existing carriers the opportunity
to deploy spectrum for 3G and 4G wireless service which will further drive the demand for communication sites. Finally, the third area of growth in the U.S. market comes from new market launches for emerging carriers in traditional wireless services
or new technologies like WiMAX. For example, Leap Wireless and Metro PCS acquired spectrum in auction 66 in new coverage areas that have led and continue to lead to the launch of brand new networks while Clearwire is in the process of building out
new markets as well. Despite the current recessionary conditions affecting the global marketplace, based on these factors, we believe that the U.S. wireless industry will continue to grow and is well-capitalized, highly competitive and focused on
quality and advanced services. Therefore, we expect that we will see a multi-year trend of strong additional cell site demand from our customers, which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us.

Business Strategy

Our
primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers. Key elements of our strategy include:

Focusing on our Site Leasing Business with Stable, Recurring Revenues.

We intend to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing
business due to its attractive characteristics such as long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins and low customer churn. The long-term nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than
our site development business, which is more cyclical. By focusing on our site leasing business, we believe that we can maintain a stable, recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending.

Maximizing Use of Tower Capacity.

We generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a
substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers. Most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost.
We actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force.

Disciplined Growth of our Tower Portfolio

.

During 2010, we intend to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, by 5% to 10%. We intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity, including borrowings, to build and/or acquire new towers
at prices that we believe will be



accretive to our shareholders both short and long term and which allow us to maintain our long-term target leverage ratios. Furthermore, we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable.
Consequently, we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling, general and administrative expenses.

Controlling our Underlying Land Positions

. We have purchased and intend to continue to purchase and/or enter into long-term leases for the land that underlies our towers, to the extent available at
commercially reasonable prices. We believe that these purchases and/or long-term leases will increase our margins, improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future. As of
December 31, 2009, we own or control, for a minimum period of fifty years, land under 27.6% of our communication sites.

Using our Local Presence to Build Strong Relationships with Major Wireless Service Providers.

Given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities, we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best
locally. Consequently, we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience, expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships. Due to our presence in
local markets, we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets.

Capitalizing on our Management Experience.

Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development.
Management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services.

Customers

Since commencing
operations, we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large wireless service providers. In both our site development and site leasing businesses, we work with large national providers and smaller regional, local or
private operators.



We depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site
development revenues. The following customers represented at least 10% of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years:

(1)

2007 and 2008 numbers have been restated due to 2009 merger of AT&T and Centennial

(2)

2007 and 2008 numbers have been restated due to 2009 merger of Sprint and IPCS Wireless

(3)

2007 and 2008 numbers have been restated due to 2009 merger of Verizon and Alltel

During the past two years, we provided services for a number of customers, including:

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing goals are to:

•

use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with
respect to our owned or managed towers, enabling us to grow our site leasing business; and

•

successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins and/or provide a financial or
strategic benefit to our site leasing business.

We approach sales on a company-wide basis, involving many
of our employees. We have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team. Our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office. We also rely on our regional vice presidents,
general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers. Our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers. Most wireless service providers
have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices. We believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their



corporate headquarters. Our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the
regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate. Our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentive-based goals and measurements.

Our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in Boca Raton, Florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices. We have a full-time staff
dedicated to our marketing and sales efforts. The marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies, prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals. In addition to our marketing and sales
staff, we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and local office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts.

Competition

Site Leasing

– Our primary competitors for our
site leasing activities are (1) the national independent tower companies, American Tower Corporation, Crown Castle International and Global Tower Partners, (2) a large number of regional independent tower owners, (3) wireless service
providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers and (4) alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system (“DAS”)
networks, billboards and electric transmission towers. There has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past five years. Specifically, American Tower completed its merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in 2005, we
completed our acquisition of AAT Communications Corporation in 2006 and Crown Castle completed its merger with Global Signal, Inc. in 2007. As a result of these consolidations, American Tower and Crown Castle have substantially more towers and
greater financial resources than we do. Wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally larger and have greater financial resources than we do. We believe that tower location and capacity, quality of
service to our tenants, and, to a lesser extent, price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business.

Site Development

– The site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive. We believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within
local market areas exclusively, while some firms appear to offer their services nationally, including Bechtel Corporation, Black & Veatch Corporation, Goodman Networks, General Dynamics Corporation, Nsoro, and Wireless Facilities, Inc. The
market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site development consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way
consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors, which provide end-to-end site development services through multiple subcontractors, and wireless service
providers’ internal staff. We believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria, including: company experience, price, track record, local reputation, geographic reach and time for completion of a
project.

Employees

Our executive, corporate development, accounting, finance, human resources, legal and regulatory, information technology and site administration personnel, and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in Boca Raton,
Florida. Certain sales, new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our Boca Raton office. Our remaining employees are based in our regional and local offices.

As of December 31, 2009, we had 617 employees, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our
employee relations to be good.



Regulatory and Environmental Matters

Federal Regulations.

Both the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) regulate antenna towers and structures
that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas. Many FAA requirements are implemented in FCC regulations. These regulations govern the construction, lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may,
depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures, require prior approval and registration of towers or structures before they may be constructed, altered or used. Wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations
operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used. In addition, any applicant for an FCC antenna tower or structure registration
must certify that, consistent with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of Federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the FCC, in conjunction with the FAA, has
developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures. These standards mandate that the FCC and the FAA consider the height of the proposed tower or structure, the relationship of the tower or structure to
existing natural or man-made obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the FAA to ensure the
structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. The FAA may condition its issuance of a no-hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting and/or painting requirements. Antenna towers that meet certain height and location
criteria must also be registered with the FCC. A tower or structure that requires FAA clearance will not be registered by the FCC until it is cleared by the FAA. Upon registration, the FCC may also require special lighting and/or painting. Owners of
wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with FAA and FCC regulations. Antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those
towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the FAA of any lighting outage or malfunction.

Owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to, and therefore must comply with, environmental laws. Any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to
environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, among other statutes, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances. The FCC has issued regulations
implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. These regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an
environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure. In the event the FCC
determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the FCC has developed, the FCC would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which will be subject to public
comment. This process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure.

We generally indemnify
our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction, modification, or placement of antenna towers or structures. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil
penalties.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning
authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction, modification and placement of towers. The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or
ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of radio communication towers. Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred
sites for their facilities. This may require



that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for
tower facilities.

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict,
joint and several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination and related personal or property damage. We are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement, including pre-construction
environmental studies. Operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency (“RF”) emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements. Certain proposals to operate
wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to RF emissions. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can
produce negative health effects. The potential connection between low-level RF energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We
believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws. These costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material
adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

State and Local Regulations.

Most
states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition, leasing activities and construction activities. Where required, we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’
agents, who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors, and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors, who may be our employees or independent contractors. Local regulations include
city and other local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval
from local officials or community standards organizations, or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures. In addition, many local zoning
authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations. Local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities
because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures, and have, in some instances, instituted moratoria.

Backlog

Backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments, which have been signed, but have
not yet commenced. As of December 31, 2009, we had 344 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases will contractually provide for approximately $7.6 million of annual revenue. By
comparison, at December 31, 2008 we had 338 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases contractually provided for approximately $6.7 million of annual revenue.

Our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts. As of
December 31, 2009, we had approximately $13.9 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately $17.4 million as of December 31, 2008.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Business

If our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our future operating results and our
ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected.

Significant consolidation among our wireless service
provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar. For example,
in connection with the combinations of Verizon Wireless and ALLTEL (to form Verizon Wireless), Cingular and AT&T Wireless (to form AT&T Mobility) and Sprint PCS and Nextel (to form Sprint Nextel), the combined companies have or are
considering rationalizing duplicative parts of their networks, which has led and may continue to lead to the non-renewal of certain leases on our towers. Furthermore, to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the future,
they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as much space on our towers in the future. If these consolidations significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new
leases that the wireless service providers require to expand their network, our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected.

Similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative
to leasing our antenna space. Wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their
home provider’s services. Wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communication sites owned or controlled by us or others. The proliferation of these roaming
agreements could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of
our revenue, therefore if any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. The loss of any one of our significant customers, as a
result of bankruptcy, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise, could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth.

The following is a list of significant customers (representing at least 10% of revenue in any of the last three years) and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from
these customers:



We also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments:

(1)

2007 and 2008 numbers have been restated due to 2009 merger of AT&T and Centennial

(2)

2007 and 2008 numbers have been restated due to 2009 merger of Sprint and IPCS Wireless

(3)

2007 and 2008 numbers have been restated due to 2009 merger of Verizon and Alltel

Revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. Each site leasing
contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. However, if any of our significant site leasing clients were to
experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth and results of operations would be
adversely affected.

Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally
terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. In addition, a customer’s need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. Furthermore, our existing customers
may not continue to engage us for additional projects.



Increasing competition to acquire existing towers may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower
portfolio long-term.

We currently intend to grow our tower portfolio 5% to10% annually through acquisitions and new
builds. Our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements. Traditionally, our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower
companies, independent tower developers and wireless service providers. However, as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these mid-sized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing
towers. Increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, higher acquisition prices, reduced willingness of sellers to accept equity as consideration for their towers and increased difficulty in negotiating
and consummating agreements to acquire such towers. Furthermore, to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than
us. If we are not able to successfully address these challenges, we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the long-term.

We have a substantial level of indebtedness, a large portion of which we will need to refinance in the next two years. In the event we are not able to refinance or repay such indebtedness, we may not be able to access the cash flow
from all of our towers and we may need to take certain actions to service our debt obligations.

As of
December 31, 2009, we had $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding, of which $0.9 billion is scheduled to be repaid in 2011. The amount scheduled to be repaid in 2011 consists solely of the 2006 CMBS Certificates which have
an anticipated repayment date in November 2011.

We do not currently expect to have sufficient cash flow from operations to
repay the full principal amount of the 2006 CMBS Certificates. Consequently, we expect to refinance a significant portion of this debt. The global credit and capital markets are undergoing a period of substantial volatility and disruption, and the
global economy is experiencing weakness and uncertainty. Although the credit markets have improved during 2009, we believe that this volatile credit environment has generally resulted in increased interest rates and/or interest rate spread as
compared to periods immediately prior to 2007. Any renewed financial turmoil, worsening credit environment, economic weakness and uncertainty could impact our ability and the cost of refinancing our 2006 CMBS Certificates.

If we are unable to refinance the 2006 CMBS Certificates by November 2011, the cash flow from the 3,746 tower sites pledged to secure
such mortgage loan underlying the 2006 CMBS Certificates, representing 45% of our total tower portfolio as of December 31, 2009, will be trapped and unavailable to service our other outstanding debt. If these cash flows become trapped, they
would be applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rate, on the mortgage loan components underlying the 2006 CMBS Certificates, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with the pledged towers, third
to pay the management fees, fourth to repay the principal of the 2006 CMBS Certificates in the order of their investment grade, and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed below. As a result of this cash trap, we would only have access to
the cash flow generated by the remaining approximately 4,578 tower sites (approximately 55% of our total tower portfolio as of December 31, 2009) and the annual management fee (equal to 7.5% of the operating revenues of the borrowers under the
CMBS Certificates for the immediately preceding calendar month) to service our other indebtedness and pay all other corporate expenses. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the mortgage loan components relating to the 2006 CMBS Certificates by
November 2011, then the interest rate on the mortgage loan underlying each subclass of the 2006 CMBS Certificates would increase by the greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten year U.S. treasury
rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for the mortgage loan component underlying the referenced subclass of the 2006 CMBS Certificates (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such
component. Such additional interest will be payable once the principal of the 2006 CMBS Certificates is repaid. The sole remedy of the lenders if we do not refinance or repay the 2006 CMBS Certificates by November 2011 is the cash trap and the
increased interest rates



discussed above, but it is not an event of default under the mortgage loan, the indenture governing any of
our outstanding notes or the Senior Credit Agreement.

If we are unable to refinance the 2006 CMBS Certificates and therefore
unable to access the cash flow from pledged towers, it may have an adverse impact on our ability to (i) repay our other indebtedness, or (ii) fund our planned capital expenditures, which would adversely affect our financial health and/or
anticipated growth.

Recent developments in the global economy could result in a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services
or for tower space, which could adversely affect our future growth and revenues.

Due to the recent economic downturn
and the resulting unemployment rates in the U.S. and internationally, consumer discretionary income has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted. If wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use, or fail to widely
adopt and use wireless data applications, our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services. As a result, they may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending, which could
materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, the recent volatility and disruption of the global credit and capital markets may adversely affect:

•

the financial condition of wireless service providers;

•

the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures; and

•

interest rates and the overall availability and cost of capital.

As a result of these factors, wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3G,
4G or other wireless services or, worse, elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses.

We have a
substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.

As indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. The following table sets
forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2008 and 2009.

Our substantial
level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest or other amounts when due. Subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may
also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured debt. This may have the effect of increasing our total leverage.

As a consequence of our indebtedness, (1) demands on our cash resources may increase, (2) we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and
(3) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our



relative leverage and our strategic plans. For example, as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness
and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the U.S. economy:

•

we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate
requirements that would be in our best long-term interests;

•

we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing
the available cash flow to fund other investments, including capital expenditures;

•

we may, in the future, be required to reduce our annual tower acquisition and new build goals;

•

we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;

•

we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and

•

we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment
obligations.

These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to
take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities.

In addition,
fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under our 2010 Credit Facility and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness, including our
2006 CMBS Certificates at a commercially reasonable rate or at all. There is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the
rates on our current indebtedness.

We may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases
may decline.

If tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease, we may not be able to
successfully grow our site leasing business as expected. This may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations. Our plan for the growth of our site leasing
business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers.

Delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate.

There can be no assurances that 3G, 4G or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these
new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. The deployment of 3G experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries, and deployment of 4G has been limited to date. Additionally, the
demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for
our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.



Increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and
adversely affect us.

Our industry is highly competitive, and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing
antenna space. Some of our competitors, such as (1) national wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers and (2) large independent tower companies, are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us. This
could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers.

In the site leasing business, we compete with:

•

wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers;

•

national and regional tower companies; and

•

alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor DAS networks, billboards and electric transmission towers.

We believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price
historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. However, competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect
our lease rates. In addition, we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. Increasing competition could also make the
acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

The site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. There are numerous large and small companies that offer one or
more of the services offered by our site development business. As a result of this competition, margins in this segment continue to be under pressure. Many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services
at prices that we consider unprofitable. If margins in this segment were to further decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected.

If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements,
licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all
information regarding title and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of
ground agreements for land under a tower, which can affect our ability to access and operate a tower site. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or
they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may
have a future material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.



Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and
adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates.

Our current business operations in Canada and our expansion into any other international markets in the future, could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not experienced in the United States. Although the
consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2009, we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations may grow in the future. Accordingly, our business is
subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;

•

laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital;

•

changes to existing or new tax laws directed specifically at the ownership and operation of tower sites;

•

expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership;

•

uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems, including inconsistencies between and within laws, regulations and decrees, and judicial application
thereof;

•

health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic;

•

difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel; and

•

language and cultural differences.

In addition, we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international
business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts.

The market price of our Class A common stock could be affected by significant volatility, which could adversely impact our ability to use equity to fund our growth plan.

The market price of our Class A common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations. Since the fall of 2008, the U.S.
stock market has been undergoing a period of very high volatility where changes in the market prices of equity securities have often been abrupt and profound over short periods of time. The market price of our Class A common stock is likely to
continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed elsewhere in “Risk Factors” and in “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Volatility or depressed market prices of our Class A common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of Class A common stock, when they want or at attractive prices. Consequently, volatility of the market price
of our Class A common stock may make it less likely that sellers will accept our equity as consideration in connection with our tower acquisitions and may make it more difficult for us to use our equity to fund our future growth plans. If we
were unable to use equity to fund the growth of our tower portfolio, we may be required to either use debt to increase our tower portfolio or reduce our anticipated growth.



Counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to fulfill their obligations
and such failure could subject us to significant costs to replace any such portion of our convertible note hedge transactions or subject us to potential dilution or additional cost, if settled in cash, upon conversion of our convertible notes.

Concurrently with the pricing of our 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2010 (the “0.375% Notes”), our
1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the “1.875% Notes”), and our 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (the “4.0% Notes”), we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial
purchasers of the convertible note offerings. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 0.375% Notes is $33.56 per share of our Class A common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the
0.375% Notes) and cover 10,429,720 shares of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2009, the convertible note hedge transactions cover 2,559,185 shares of our Class A common stock, as a result of repurchases and termination of
$264.1million in principal of 0.375% Notes and convertible note hedges. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1.875% Notes is $41.46 per share of our Class A common stock (the same as the initial
conversion price of our 1.875% convertible notes) and cover 13,265,780 shares of our Class A common stock. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 4.0% convertible Notes is $30.38 per share of our
Class A common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 4.0% Notes) and cover 16,458,196 shares of our Class A common stock.

Since the fall of 2008, global economic conditions and the financial markets have been and continue to be volatile. Certain financial institutions have filed for bankruptcy, have sold some or all of their
assets, or may be looking to enter into a merger or other transaction with another financial institution. As a result of these conditions, some of the counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to perform their
obligations under such instruments. One of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with our 1.875% Notes was with Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (“Lehman Derivatives”) which covers 55% of the 13,265,780
shares of our Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our 1.875% convertible notes. In October 2008, Lehman Derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
which constituted an “event of default” under the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. As a result, on November 7, 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. Based on
information available to us, we have no indication, as of the date of filing this Form 10-K, that any party other than Lehman Derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the convertible note hedge transactions.

If we were to elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives or any other counterparty, we would incur
significant costs to replace such hedge transactions. Additionally, if we do not elect to replace our convertible note hedge transactions that were previously with Lehman Derivatives or any other counterparty fails to perform its obligations under
our outstanding convertible note hedge transactions, we would be subject to potential dilution or additional cost, if settled in cash, upon conversion of the applicable 0.375% Notes, 1.875% Notes and 4.0% Notes.

We may not be able to build as many towers as we anticipate

.

We currently intend to build at least 120 to 140 new towers during 2010. However, our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our
ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits.

Due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated, the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as
many towers as we had planned in 2010. If we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals.



Our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by
limiting our flexibility.

Our 2010 Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants. Among other things, these
covenants limit our ability to:

•

incur additional indebtedness;

•

sell assets;

•

make certain investments;

•

engage in mergers or consolidations;

•

incur liens; and

•

enter into affiliate transactions.

These covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. Further, these
covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisitions or other opportunities. If we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an
event of default under the 2010 Credit Facility. In addition, if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness, including under our 2006 CMBS Certificates and our notes, then such default could cause a cross-default under our 2010 Credit
Facility.

The mortgage loan relating to our 2006 CMBS Certificates also contains financial covenants that require that the
mortgage loan borrowers maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum debt service coverage ratio. To the extent that the debt service coverage, as of the end of any calendar quarter, (1) is less than 1.30 times, all cash flow generated by
the pledged towers must be deposited into a reserve account and (2) is less than 1.15 times, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until
such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter. As lease payments from 3,746 tower sites of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan, if this cash flow was not available
to us it could adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness, other than the mortgage loan, and to operate our business.

New
technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations.

The emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. For example, the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless
service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space. Additionally, the
use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as beam forming or “smart antennae,” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to
adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space. The development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video,
voice and data services by satellites or other technologies, could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space.



Our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business.

We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our only significant asset is, and is expected to
be, the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. We conduct, and expect to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon
dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. Most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries, including the mortgage loan underlying the 2006 CMBS Notes, the 2016 Notes, the 2019 Notes and any amounts that we may
borrow under the 2010 Credit Facility. Consequently, the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal, if any, under their respective indebtedness. Other than the cash required
to repay amounts due under our outstanding convertible notes, we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their respective debt
obligations. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments.

Our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely
basis with regard to such fluctuations.

The demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to
quarter and should not be considered indicative of long-term results. Numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including:

•

the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures;

•

the size and scope of our projects;

•

the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’
fiscal year;

•

delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment;

•

seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter;

•

the use of third party providers by our customers;

•

the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development; and

•

general economic conditions.

Although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts. In addition, the
timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. Therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services.



We are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses.

We are not profitable. The following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated:

Our losses are principally
due to depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, interest expense (including non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees), and losses from the extinguishment of debt as well as impairment charges on our towers and
auction rate securities in the periods presented above. We expect to continue to incur significant losses, which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness.

The loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel. We cannot guarantee that we will
be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. We have employment agreements with Jeffrey A. Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kurt L. Bagwell, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Thomas P. Hunt,
our Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel and Brendan T. Cavanagh, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. If we were to lose
any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient
number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our costs could increase and our revenues could
decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency (“RF”) energy.

The government imposes
requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to RF energy. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can cause negative health effects. The potential connection between exposure to low levels of RF energy and certain negative health effects,
including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. According to the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), the results of these studies to date have been
inconclusive. However, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public
perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. Moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of RF energy and possible negative health effects, including
cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. If we were subject to claims relating to exposure to RF energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely
affected.

Our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business.

We are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business. In particular, both the Federal Aviation
Administration (“FAA”) and FCC regulate the construction, modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas. In addition, the FCC separately licenses and
regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures. FAA and FCC regulations govern construction, lighting, painting and marking of



towers and structures and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure, require registration of the tower or structure. Certain proposals to construct new towers or structures
or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the FAA to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation.

Antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to FAA and FCC regulations and to maintain such marking,
painting and lighting. Antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any lighting outages. Certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from
antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements. Failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may
subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. In addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth.

Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by
community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification. Local regulations can
delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. In addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to
us. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations.

Our towers are subject to damage from
natural disasters.

Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes
and earthquakes. We maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. We also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and
deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. A tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a
material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.

We could have liability under environmental laws that could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our operations, like those of
other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use,
storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. As owner, lessee or operator of numerous tower sites, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and
groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply
with any of these requirements. The current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. However, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could
become more stringent in the future. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We have adopted anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law could make it more difficult for a third
party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. We adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that
our board of directors opposes. These provisions, alone or in combination with each other,



may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of
our Class A common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

Our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in
the future.

The issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will
have a future ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. We may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control, caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. Depending on our market
value at the time of such future ownership change, an ownership change under Section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income. Currently, we
have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized.

We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, or we are
unable to utilize our net operating losses.

We are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing
authorities in the states and countries where we do business. We also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses (“NOLs”) in U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. Generally, for U.S. federal and state
tax purposes, NOLs can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years, and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our NOLs are used or expire. We expect that we will continue to be subject to tax
examinations in the future. We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority. We believe our judgments in this area are
reasonable and correct, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority. If there are tax benefits, including from our use of NOLs or other tax attributes, that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority,
we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities, which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

In addition, we may be limited in our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income and
thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes. We have substantial federal and state NOLs, including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as those generated through our historic business operations. In
addition, we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities.

To the extent we believe that a position with respect to an NOL is not more likely than not to be sustained, we do not record the related deferred tax asset. In addition, for NOLs that meet the
recognition threshold, we assess the recoverability of the NOL and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the NOL if recoverability is questionable. Given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain
of our NOLs, we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our NOLs.

Our ability to utilize our NOLs is also dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our NOLs before they
expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our NOLs, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance. We review our uncertain
tax position and the valuation allowance for our NOLs periodically and make adjustments from time to time, which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our NOLs. Our NOLs are also subject to review and
potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the NOLs were incurred, and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our NOLs. If we are
unable to use our NOLs or use of our NOLs is limited, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our



deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause
dilution or adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equity-related offerings.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the Notes,
could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our Class A common stock or other
equity-related securities would have on the market price of our Class A common stock.

PROPERTIES

We are
headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, where we currently lease approximately 73,000 square feet of space. We have entered into long-term leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be
longer-term. We open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business. We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space
suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate.

Our interests in towers are comprised of
a variety of fee interests, leasehold interests created by long-term lease agreements, perpetual easements, easements and licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. Of the 8,324 tower sites in our portfolio, approximately 27.6% are
located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land that have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 50 years. In rural areas, a wireless communications site typically consists of up to a 10,000 square
foot tract, which supports towers, equipment shelters and related equipment. Less than 2,500 square feet is required for a monopole or self-supporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications tower
sites. Land leases generally have an initial term of five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years, for a total of thirty years or more.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are
involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

ITEM 6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

Effective January 1, 2009, we retrospectively adopted new convertible debt accounting rules which require the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) on conversion
to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Our 0.375% Notes and 1.875% Notes are subject to the
retrospective restatement requirements required by the new convertible debt accounting. Our consolidated statements of operations and our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of adopting the new convertible debt accounting. No periods prior to 2007 were affected by the adoption of the new convertible debt
accounting. See Note 2 and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2008. The accompanying selected financial data and Management’s Discussion and Analysis reflects the changes due to the implementation.

The following table sets forth selected historical financial data as of and for each of the five years ended December 31, 2009. The financial data for the fiscal years ended 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008,
and 2009 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained
in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers. Our principal operations are in the Continental United States. In addition, we have towers in Canada, Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed approximately 97.4% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2009. In our site leasing business, we lease antenna space
to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own, manage or lease from others. The towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider, built or constructed based on our own initiative
or acquired. As of December 31, 2009, we owned 8,324 tower sites, the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless
service providers. As of December 31, 2009, we also managed or leased approximately 5,100 actual or potential communications sites, approximately 550 of which were revenue producing as of December 31, 2009. Our other business line is our
site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a
variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts. Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. Wireless service providers enter
into numerous different tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site. Tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the
tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3% - 4% per year, including the renewal option periods. Tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly
on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue.

Cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:

•

Rental payments on ground and other underlying property leases;

•

Straight-line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly
throughout the minimum lease term (which may include renewal terms) of the underlying property leases;

•

Property taxes;

•

Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);

•

Utilities;

•

Property insurance; and

•

Deferred lease origination cost amortization.



For any given tower, such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time
period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of other direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending
on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower but typically do not make up a large percentage of total operating costs. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a
tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing. Lastly, ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically
average 3% - 4% annually or provide for term escalators of approximately 15%.

Our site leasing business generates
substantially all of our segment operating profit. The table below details the percentage of total company revenues and total segment operating profit contributed by the site leasing business over the last three years. For information regarding our
operating segments, see Note 23 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

(1)

Site leasing segment operating profit and total segment operating profit are non-GAAP financial measures. We reconcile these measures and other Regulation G disclosures
in this annual report in the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

We believe that over the long-term,
site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use, network expansion and network coverage requirements. We believe our site leasing
business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain
these towers to be minimal. Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of
tower modifications. Furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not re-locate, we have historically experienced low customer churn as a percentage of revenue.

Site Development Services

Our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business, and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and capture
ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Our site development business consists of two segments, site development consulting and site development
construction. Site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or



project management services to wireless service providers. We principally perform services for third parties
in our core, historical areas of wireless expertise, specifically site acquisition zoning, technical services and construction.

Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. Site development projects, both consulting and construction, include contracts on a
time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. The majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis. Time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the
services are rendered. Our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete. For those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis, we recognize revenue based on the
completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis.

Our revenue from site development construction contracts
is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total
cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. Revenue from our site development
construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities, which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures, the number and significance of active customer engagements
during a period, weather and other factors.

Cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue includes all
costs of materials, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects. All costs related to site development consulting contracts and construction
contracts are recognized as incurred.

The table below provides the percentage of total company revenues contributed by site
development services over the last three years. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 23 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

We have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business
operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The
impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported
and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the



application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2009, included herein. Our preparation of our
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results
will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.

Construction Revenue

Revenue from construction projects is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of
cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract. These amounts are based on estimates, and
the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion. The asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues
recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment.

Asset Impairment

We
evaluate the potential impairment of individual long-lived assets, principally the tower sites. We record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or intangible assets has been impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows
would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site. We consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment, including but not limited to: general market and economic conditions,
historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge.
Changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value which is different from management’s estimates. Future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value,
thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. In addition, if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect, a future impairment charge may be required.

Property Tax Expense

We typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business. As a result, we recognize property tax expense, which is
reflected as a component of site leasing cost of revenue, based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period. We consider several factors in establishing this estimate, including our historical level of
incurred property taxes, the location of the property, our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information. If our estimates regarding anticipated property tax expenses are incorrect, a
future increase or decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required.



KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This report contains certain non-GAAP
measures, including Segment Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA information. We have provided below a description of such non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and an
explanation as to why management utilizes these measures.

Segment Operating Profit:

We believe that Segment Operating Profit is an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and
is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment, while excluding the impact of depreciation, accretion and amortization, which is largely fixed and non-cash in nature. Segment Operating
Profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The increase in site leasing segment operating profit of $65.8 million in 2009 is primarily
related to additional profit generated by the revenues from the towers that we acquired in the 2008 acquisitions of Optasite, Light Tower and Tower Co and the other towers that we acquired or constructed subsequent to December 31, 2008, organic
site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers in the year ended December 31, 2009, control of
our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program.

The increase in site leasing
segment operating profit of $65.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily related to additional profit generated by the number of towers acquired and constructed for the year ended December 31, 2008, as well as additional revenue from the
increased number of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 without a commensurate increase in site leasing cost of revenue.

Each respective Segment Operating Profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues (excluding depreciation, accretion and
amortization). Total Segment Operating Profit is the total of the operating profits of the three segments. The reconciliation of Segment Operating Profit is as follows:



Adjusted EBITDA

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an indicator of the performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation that has been
used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance
with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA was $338.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $269.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2008. The increase of $69.3 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment.

Adjusted EBITDA was $269.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $209.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase of $59.8 million is primarily the result
of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding the
impact of net interest expenses (including amortization of deferred financing fees), provision for taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset impairment and other charges, non-cash compensation, loss (gain) from extinguishment of debt,
net, other income and expenses, acquisition related expenses, non-cash straight-line leasing revenue and non-cash straight-line ground lease expense. Adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition related costs which were previously capitalized but,
commencing January 1, 2009, were required to be expensed and included within operating expenses pursuant to the adoption of new business combination accounting guidance. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:



(1)

Includes $1,712, $1,334, and $1,125 of franchise taxes reflected on the Statement of Operations in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

(2)

The years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 reflect acquisition integration costs that were previously reflected on the Statement of Operations in selling, general
and administrative expenses.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended 2009 Compared to Year Ended 2008

Revenues:

Site leasing revenue increased $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 largely due to (i) revenues from the towers that we acquired in the 2008 acquisitions of Optasite, Light Tower
and Tower Co and the other towers that we acquired or constructed subsequent to December 31, 2008 and (ii) organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which
increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers. Average rents per tenant increased in the year ended December 31, 2009 due primarily to rent escalators, lease amendments and higher rents associated with new
leases.

Site development consulting revenue decreased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the
same period in the prior year as a result of a lower volume of work. Site development construction revenues remained relatively stable for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.



Operating Expenses:

Site leasing cost of revenues increased $15.7 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of tower sites owned by us, which was 8,324 at December 31, 2009 up from 7,854 at
December 31, 2008 offset by the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program.

Site development consulting cost
of revenues and site development construction cost of revenues decreased by $2.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of lower volume of work
and continued effort to manage and reduce fixed overhead costs.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $4.1
million primarily as a result of an increase in salaries, benefits and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees, and increased non-cash compensation expense that we recognized for the year ended
December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.

Acquisition related expenses of $4.8 million are
associated with acquisitions which effective January 1, 2009, are required to be expensed and included within operating expenses. We had historically capitalized the majority of these expenses.

Asset impairment of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 is a result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations
for 21 towers that have not achieved expected lease-up results as determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book value of the tower assets and an impairment charge on our six DAS networks based on the estimated
fair value of the DAS networks at December 31, 2009. Asset impairment of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 is a result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations for eight towers that have not achieved expected
lease-up results as determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book value of the tower asset and related intangibles.

Depreciation, accretion and amortization expense increased $47.1 million to $258.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $211.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due to an
increase in the number of towers and associated intangible assets we owned for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to those owned at December 31, 2008.

Operating Income:

Operating income increased $9.4 million for year ended
December 31, 2009 to $55.0 million compared to $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the result of higher segment operating profit in the site leasing segment partially offset by increases in depreciation,
accretion and amortization expense, acquisition related expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses.

Other Income (Expense):

Interest income decreased $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of lower weighted average interest rates offset by higher average invested funds during 2009 compared to 2008.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $25.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase
is primarily due to the higher interest rates on the mix of our outstanding debt and the higher weighted average amount of cash interest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2008.

Non-cash interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $16.6 million from the
year ended December 31, 2008. This increase primarily reflects the accretion of debt discounts on the Senior Notes which were issued in July 2009 and the 4.0% Notes which were issued in April 2009 and the Optasite Credit Facility



acquired in September 2008, offset by the impact of the repurchase of an aggregate of $319.6 million in principal of the 0.375% Notes in the fourth quarter of 2008 and year ended
December 31, 2009.

The net loss from extinguishment of debt of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
includes a loss of $7.2 million related to the repurchases and subsequent payoff of our 2005 CMBS Certificates in July 2009, $2.7 million associated with the repurchase of $150.1 million in principal of our 2006 CMBS Certificates and $1.9 million
related to the payoff of our Optasite Credit Facility in July 2009, offset slightly by a gain of $6.1 million associated with the repurchases of an aggregate of $107.7 million in principal of our 0.375% Notes. The net gain from extinguishment of
debt of $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $25.7 million related to the repurchase of $211.9 million in principal amount of our 0.375% Notes and $18.9 million related to the repurchases of $65.5 million of our CMBS
Certificates offset by the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the portion of the debt extinguished and the reduction in the aggregate commitment of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility as a result of Lehman Commercial Paper
Inc.’s default of its funding obligations. See discussion in Note 13 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $13.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease primarily reflects an other-than-temporary impairment
charge on our investments in auction rate securities during 2008. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this other-than-temporary impairment charge.

Net Loss:

Net loss was
$141.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 is primarily the result of: the 2009 net losses from the early extinguishment of debt as opposed to
net gains from the early extinguishment of debt in 2008, increases in interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and depreciation, accretion and amortization expense partially offset by an increase in site leasing segment operating profit.



Year Ended 2008 Compared to Year Ended 2007

Revenues:

Site leasing revenue increased $73.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due to an increase in the number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our historical towers and from
revenue generated by the towers that we acquired or constructed subsequent to December 31, 2007. Additionally, we have experienced, on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants, higher annual rents upon renewal by
existing tenants and higher rents from additional equipment added by existing tenants.

Site development consulting and
construction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 decreased $7.0 million as a result of a lower volume of work and a wind down of certain of our prior contracts with Sprint offset by additional
contracts with T-Mobile and Metro PCS.



Operating Expenses:

Site leasing cost of revenues increased $8.2 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of tower sites owned by us, which was 7,854 at December 31, 2008 up from 6,220 at
December 31, 2007 offset by the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program.

Site development consulting cost
of revenues and site development construction cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $3.4 million compared to the same period of 2007 as a result of a decline in the volume of work performed for Sprint offset by
additional contracts with T-Mobile and Metro PCS.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $3.2 million
primarily as a result of a $0.9 million one-time severance expense related to the departure of our former Chief Financial Officer, a $0.6 million one-time settlement expense associated with the termination of the pension plan we acquired as part of
our acquisition of AAT Communications Corporation in 2006 and an increase in salaries, benefits and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees, and increased non-cash compensation expense that we recognized
for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007.

Asset impairment of $0.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2008 is the result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations for eight towers that have not achieved expected lease-up results as determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book
value of the tower asset and related intangibles.

Depreciation, accretion and amortization expense increased $42.2 million to
$211.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to an increase in the number of towers and associated intangible assets we owned for the year ended December 31, 2008
compared to the same period of 2007.

Operating Income:

Operating income was $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily the result of higher site
leasing segment operating profit, offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation, accretion and amortization expense.

Other Income (Expense):

Interest income decreased $3.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease is primarily the result of lower interest rates coupled with a decrease in the average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2008
compared to the same period of 2007.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $12.3 million from
the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase is primarily due to the higher weighted average amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007,
which is partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average cash interest rate for the same periods. Specifically, we issued $550.0 million of 1.875% Notes in May 2008, borrowed $465.6 million and paid fees and interest on borrowings under our
Senior Credit Facility, which we entered into in January 2008, and assumed as part of the Optasite acquisition its $150 million fully-drawn credit facility in September 2008.

Non-cash interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $19.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. This
increase primarily reflects the accretion of interest for the debt discount on the 1.875% Notes issued in May 2008 and the discount on the credit facility which was assumed as part of the Optasite acquisition in September 2008.



Amortization of deferred financing fees increased by $2.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily a result of the amortization of fees relating to the Senior Credit Facility entered into during the first quarter of 2008 and the $550.0
million principal amount of 1.875% Notes issued in May 2008.

The net gain from extinguishment of debt was $44.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008. The net gain includes the extinguishment of $138.1 million in principal amount of our 0.375% Notes and $65.5 million of our CMBS Certificates for $147.8 million in cash and the issuance of 3,407,914 shares of
our Class A common stock for $73.8 million in principal amount of 0.375% Notes offset by the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the portion of the debt extinguished and the reduction in the aggregate commitment of the lenders under
the Senior Credit Facility as a result of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc.’s default of its funding obligations. See discussion in Note 13 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The loss from write-off of
deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 associated with the termination of the senior revolving credit facility in April 2007.

Other expense of $13.5 million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively,
includes an other-than-temporary impairment loss on investments, associated with our investments in auction rate securities. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and
this other-than-temporary impairment charge.

Net Loss:

Net loss was $67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease of $24.3 million is primarily the result of the
net gains from the early extinguishment of debt and an increase in site leasing segment operating profit partially offset by an increase in depreciation, accretion and amortization expense, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing fees
and other expense.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SBA Communications Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. SBA Communications’ only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, Inc.
which is also a holding company that owns equity interests in (1) SBA Infrastructure Holdings I, Inc. (the entity that indirectly owns all of the towers and other assets acquired in the Optasite acquisition), (2) SBA Senior Finance, Inc.
(the entity that indirectly owns all of our other domestic towers and assets) and (3) our international entities. We conduct all of our business operations through Telecommunications’ subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to
pay our obligations, other than financings, is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries.

A summary of our cash flows is as follows:



Sources of Liquidity

We fund our growth, including our tower portfolio growth, through cash flows from operations, long-term indebtedness and equity issuances. With respect to our debt financing, we have utilized secured and
unsecured financings and issuances at various levels of our organizational structure to minimize our financing costs while maximizing our operational flexibility.

Cash provided by operating activities was $219.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $173.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily the
result of an increase in segment operating profit from the site leasing segment.

On July 24, 2009, Telecommunications
issued $750 million of unsecured Senior Notes, which we refer to as the Senior Notes, $375 million of which are due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”) and $375 million of which are due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”). The 2016 Notes have an
interest rate of 8.00% and were issued at a price of 99.330% of their face value. The 2019 Notes have an interest rate of 8.25% and were issued at a price of 99.152% of their face value. Net proceeds of this offering were $727.9 million after
deducting expenses and original issue discount. Telecommunications used the net proceeds to repay the 2005 CMBS Certificates issued by its subsidiary and the related prepayment consideration and repay the principal amounts outstanding under the
Optasite Credit Facility and the Senior Credit Facility. Telecommunications also intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase prior to maturity or repay at maturity our outstanding 0.375% Notes. The remaining net proceeds are
being used for general corporate purposes.

On April 24, 2009, SBA Communications issued $500.0 million of 4.0% Notes in
a private placement transaction. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $488.2 million after deducting discounts, commissions and expenses. Contemporaneously with the closing of the sale of the 4.0% Notes, a portion of the net proceeds
from the sale of the 4.0% Notes was used to repurchase and subsequently retire 2.0 million shares of our Class A common stock, valued at approximately $50.0 million based on the closing stock price of $24.80 on April 20, 2009.
Concurrently with the pricing of the 4.0% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. A portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 4.0% Notes and the warrants were used to pay for the cost of the convertible note
hedge transactions. The remaining net proceeds of $376.6 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases or repayments of our outstanding debt.

Effective April 14, 2009, SBA Senior Finance entered into a New Lender Supplement to the Senior Credit Agreement with Barclays Bank PLC. The New Lender Supplement added Barclays as a lender under the
Senior Credit Facility and increased the aggregate commitment under the Senior Credit Facility from $285.0 million to $320.0 million, availability of which was based on compliance with certain financial ratios. Availability under the Senior Credit
Facility was $319.9 million as of December 31, 2009. During 2009, SBA Senior Finance borrowed $8.5 million and repaid $239.1 million under its Senior Credit Facility, which is presented within “Cash flows from financing activities” on
our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We used or designated such proceeds for construction and acquisition of towers and for ground lease buyouts. On February 11, 2010, SBA Senior Finance terminated the Senior Credit Facility.

On February 11, 2010, SBA Senior Finance II, LLC (“SBA Senior Finance II”), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered
into a credit agreement for a $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2010 Credit Facility”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the credit agreement (the
“Credit Agreement”). Amounts borrowed under the 2010 Credit Facility will be secured by a first lien on the capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, Inc., SBA Senior Finance, Inc. and SBA Senior Finance II, and substantially all of the
assets, other than leasehold, easement or fee interests in real property, of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The 2010 Credit Facility matures on February 11, 2015 and may be borrowed,
repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with the financial and other covenants in the Credit Agreement. As of the date of this filing, availability under the 2010



Credit Facility was $500.0 million. The material terms of the 2010 Credit Facility are described below under “Debt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements – 2010 Credit
Facility.”

Equity Issuances

We have on file with the Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 registering shares of Class A common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless
communication towers or antenna sites and related assets or, companies who own wireless communication towers, antenna sites or related assets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we issued approximately 0.9 million shares of
Class A common stock under this registration statement. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 1.7 million shares of Class A common stock remaining under this shelf registration statement.

On March 3, 2009, we filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers on Form
S-3ASR. This registration statement enables us to issue shares of our Class A common stock, preferred stock or debt securities either separately or represented by warrants, or depositary shares as well as units that include any of these
securities. Under the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements, we will file a prospectus supplement and advise the Commission of the amount and type of securities each time we issue securities under this registration statement. For
the year ended December 31, 2009, we did not issue any securities under this automatic shelf registration statement.

Uses of
Liquidity

Traditionally, our principal use of liquidity has been cash capital expenditures associated with the growth of
our tower portfolio. During the recent market disruptions that occurred from October 2008 through 2009, we utilized our liquidity to take advantage of certain market opportunities and repurchase our outstanding debt. However, based on the
normalization of the capital markets and our recent financing activity, we currently believe that our principal use of liquidity will be to fund tower growth and, secondarily, our stock repurchase program. However, in the future, we may continue to
repurchase, for cash or equity, our outstanding indebtedness in privately-negotiated or open market transactions in order to optimize our liquidity and leverage and take advantage of market opportunities.

Our cash capital expenditures, including cash used for acquisitions, for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $227.5 million. The
$227.5 million includes cash capital expenditures of $169.2 million that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of 376 completed towers, net of related working capital adjustments and net of related prorated rental receipts and payments and
earnouts associated with previous acquisitions. The $227.5 million also includes $30.2 million related to new tower construction, $6.6 million for maintenance tower capital expenditures, $8.3 million for augmentations and tower upgrades, $1.6
million for general corporate expenditures, and $11.6 million for ground lease purchases. The $30.2 million of new tower construction includes costs associated with the completion of 101 new towers for the year ended December 31, 2009 and costs
incurred on sites currently in process. In addition, we paid $4.2 million in cash to amend and extend existing ground leases.

Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we acquired 14 towers from third party sellers and an equity interest in DAS provider Extenet Systems, inc. in exchange for $42.9 million in cash and a contribution of our six DAS networks.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased, in privately negotiated or open market transactions an aggregate of $107.7
million of our 0.375% Notes and $150.1 million in principal of our 2006 CMBS Certificates for aggregate consideration of 618,000 shares of our Class A common stock and $241.1 million in cash. In addition, in July 2009 we used the proceeds from
the issuance of our Senior Notes to repay the remaining outstanding balances of our 2005 CMBS Certificates and our Senior Credit Facility and repay and terminate the Optasite Credit Facility.



Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we repurchased an aggregate of $2.0 million of our
2006 CMBS Certificates for $2.1 million in cash.

The Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective
November 3, 2009. This program authorizes us to purchase, from time to time, up to $250.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and/or in privately negotiated transactions at management’s discretion based on market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. This program will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by our
Board of Directors at any time in our sole discretion. In connection with the stock repurchase program, in December 2009, we repurchased and retired approximately 52,000 shares for an aggregate of $1.7 million including commissions and fees.

Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we have repurchased 207,000 shares for an aggregate of $6.7 million including
commissions and fees.

In order to manage our leverage position and/or to ensure continued compliance with our financial
covenants, we may decide to pursue a variety of other financial transactions. These transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness, the repurchase of outstanding indebtedness for cash or equity, selling certain assets or lines of
business, issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, or pursuing other financing alternatives, including securitization transactions. If either our debt repurchases or exchanges or any of the other financial
transactions are implemented, these actions could materially impact the amount and composition of indebtedness outstanding, increase our interest expense and/or dilute our existing shareholders. We cannot assure you that we will not implement any of
these strategies or that, if implemented, these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to us and our shareholders.

During 2010, we expect to incur non-discretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of $7 million to $11 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures, based on current
obligations, of $120 million to $140 million primarily associated with the towers we intend to build in 2010, tower acquisitions currently under contract, tower augmentations and ground lease purchases. We intend to spend additional capital in 2010
on acquiring revenue producing assets not yet identified and under contract.

We estimate we will incur approximately $1,000
per tower per year for capital improvements or modifications to our towers. All of these planned cash capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash flow from operations and borrowings under the 2010 Credit Facility. The exact
amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio, our new tower build and tower acquisition program, and our ground lease purchase program.

Debt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements

As of December 31, 2009, we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months.

CMBS Certificates

In November 2005, an indirect subsidiary of SBA Senior Finance (the “Trust”), issued $405 million of CMBS Certificates (the “2005 CMBS Certificates”). In November 2006, the Trust subsequently issued $1.15 billion of CMBS
Certificates (the “2006 CMBS Certificates” and collectively with the 2005 CMBS Certificates, the “CMBS Certificates”).

The 2005 CMBS Certificates consisted of five classes with annual pass-through interest rates ranging from 5.369% to 6.706%. The 2005 CMBS Certificates had an anticipated repayment date of November 2010
with a final repayment date in 2035. During 2009 we repurchased, in privately negotiated and open market transactions,



an aggregate of $18.6 million, in principal amount of the 2005 CMBS Certificates for cash consideration of $16.6 million. On July 28, 2009, we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of the
2005 CMBS Certificates for $390.3 million in cash (including $10.1 million in prepayment consideration). In addition, during 2008 we repurchased, in privately negotiated and open market transactions, an aggregate of $6.2 million, in principal amount
of the 2005 CMBS Certificates for cash consideration of $5.5 million.

The 2006 CMBS Certificates consist of nine classes with
annual pass-through interest rates ranging from 5.314% to 7.825%. The weighted average annual fixed interest rate of the 2006 CMBS Certificates as of December 31, 2009 is 5.9%, payable monthly, and the effective weighted average annual fixed
interest rate is 6.2% after giving effect to the settlement of the nine interest rate swap agreements entered into in contemplation of the transaction. The 2006 CMBS Certificates have an anticipated repayment date of November 2011 with a final
repayment date in 2036. However, to the extent that the full amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the 2006 CMBS Certificates are not fully repaid by their anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each component would
increase by the greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus
(z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we
repurchased an aggregate of $150.1 million in principal amount of 2006 CMBS Certificates for $150.5 million in cash. At December 31, 2009, we had $940.6 million outstanding of 2006 CMBS Certificates. Based on the amounts outstanding at
December 31, 2009, debt service for the next twelve months on the 2006 CMBS Certificates will be approximately $55.5 million.

Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we repurchased an aggregate of $2.0 million in principal amount of 2006 CMBS Certificates for $2.1 million in cash. Our outstanding balance on the 2006 CMBS Certificates was $938.6 million as of the
date of this filing.

The CMBS Certificates are repayable with the proceeds of a non-recourse mortgage loan, the sole asset of
the Trust, made in favor of certain operating subsidiaries of SBA Senior Finance (the “CMBS Borrowers”). The CMBS Borrowers are special purpose vehicles which exist solely to hold the towers that are subject to the securitization (the
“CMBS Towers”). Each of the CMBS Borrowers, who are jointly and severally liable under the mortgage loan, have pledged the cash flows from the CMBS Towers owned by the entity as security under the mortgage loan. As of December 31,
2009, the CMBS Borrowers owned an aggregate 3,746 tower sites.

If the CMBS Borrowers are in compliance with the required debt
service coverage ratio set forth in the mortgage loan underlying the 2006 CMBS Certificates, and the anticipated repayment date has not yet occurred, then the cash flow generated by the CMBS Towers after (1) payment of the interest on the
mortgage loan, (2) funding of all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with the CMBS Towers, and (3) payment of the management fees due to SBA Network Management, Inc. (equal to 7.5% of the CMBS Borrowers’ operating
revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month), will be distributed to the CMBS Borrowers.

However, if the debt
service coverage ratio (“Net Cash Flow” (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the sum of the interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the CMBS Borrowers will be required to pay over the
succeeding twelve months) falls to 1.30x or lower as of the end of any calendar quarter, then all operating cash flow from the CMBS Towers in excess of amounts required to (i) pay interest, at the original interest rate, on the mortgage loan
underlying the 2006 CMBS Certificates, (ii) fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with the pledged towers, and (iii) pay the SBA Network management fees, will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being
released to the CMBS Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the CMBS Borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the debt service coverage ratio falls below
1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account and all excess cash flow generated thereafter will be applied to prepay the components of the mortgage
loan in the order of their investment grade until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. In addition, if the 2006 CMBS Certificates are not fully repaid by their repayment date, the cash



flow from the CMBS Towers will be trapped by the trustee for the 2006 CMBS Certificates and applied first to repay the interest on the mortgage loan, calculated at the original interest rate,
second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with the CMBS Towers, third to pay the SBA Network management fees, fourth to repay principal of the 2006 CMBS Certificates in the order of their investment grade and fifth to
repay the additional interest discussed above. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the required debt service coverage ratio as defined by the mortgage loan agreement.

At any time prior to November 2011, the CMBS Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part for the components of the mortgage
loan corresponding to the 2006 CMBS Certificates upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. The prepayment consideration is determined per class and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value on
the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date that is nine months prior to the anticipated repayment date, assuming the entire unpaid
principal amount of such class is required to be paid, over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment. If the prepayment occurs (i) within nine months of the anticipated repayment date,
(ii) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of the CMBS Borrowers’ sites or (iii) during an amortization period, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan
components corresponding to the 2006 CMBS Certificates will be due in November 2036. The mortgage loan may be defeased in whole at any time prior to the anticipated repayment date.

The mortgage loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the tower sites and
their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the CMBS Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (3) the CMBS Borrowers’ rights under the management agreement they entered into with SBA Network
Management, Inc. (“SBA Network Management”) relating to the management of the CMBS Borrowers’ tower sites by SBA Network Management pursuant to which SBA Network Management arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the
funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on the CMBS Borrowers’ behalf, (4) the CMBS Borrowers’ right under certain site management agreements, (5) the CMBS
Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases, (6) the pledge by SBA CMBS-1 Guarantor, LLC and SBA CMBS-1 Holdings, LLC of equity interest of the initial borrower and SBA CMBS-1 Guarantor, LLC, (7) the various deposit accounts and
collection accounts of the CMBS Borrowers and (8) all proceeds of the foregoing.

Convertible Senior Notes

0.375% Convertible Senior Notes

- On March 26, 2007, we issued $350.0 million of our 0.375% Notes. Interest is payable
semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. The 0.375% Notes have a maturity date of December 1, 2010. The 0.375% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of our Class A common stock, at an initial conversion
rate of 29.7992 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 0.375% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $33.56 per share or a 19% conversion
premium based on the last reported sale price of $28.20 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 20, 2007, the purchase agreement date.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 0.375% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we purchased from affiliates
of two of the initial purchasers of the 0.375% Notes, an option covering 10,429,720 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial price of $33.56 per share. Separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 0.375% Notes, we entered into
warrant transactions whereby we sold to affiliates of two of the initial purchasers of the 0.375% Notes warrants to acquire 10,429,720 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial exercise price of $55.00 per share. The convertible note
hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, taken as a whole, effectively increase the conversion price of the 0.375% Notes from $33.56 per share to $55.00 per share. As we cannot determine when, or whether, the 0.375% Notes will be converted,
the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, taken as a whole, minimize the



dilution risk associated with early conversion of the 0.375% Notes until such time that our Class A common stock is trading at a price above $55.00 per share (the upper strike of the
warrants).

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we consummated privately negotiated exchanges of the 0.375% Notes
for Class A common stock in reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pursuant to these exchanges, we issued approximately 618,000 shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for $12.5 million in
principal amount of 0.375% Notes. In addition, we also repurchased an aggregate of $95.2 million in principal amount of 0.375% Notes for $90.6 million in cash.

In April 2009, we also terminated the portion of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in March 2007 with respect to our 0.375% Notes which related to the $264.1 million
principal amount of 0.375% Notes that we previously repurchased for cash or stock. We received a net settlement of approximately 546,000 shares from the counterparties of the hedge and warrant transactions which is reflected in the Consolidated
Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. As of December 31, 2009, 2,559,185 shares of our Class A common stock remain under convertible note hedge transactions.

At December 31, 2009, we had $30.4 million outstanding of 0.375% Notes. Based on the maturity date of December 1, 2010 of the 0.375% Notes, debt service for 2010 will be $30.4 million in
principal and approximately $0.1 million in interest. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes issued in July 2009 to repurchase prior to maturity or repay at maturity our remaining 0.375% Notes outstanding.

1.875% Convertible Senior Notes

- On May 16, 2008 we issued $550.0 million of our 1.875% Notes. Interest is payable
semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. The maturity date of the 1.875% Notes is May 1, 2013. The 1.875% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of our Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of
24.1196 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $41.46 per share or a 20% conversion premium
based on the last reported sale price of $34.55 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2008, the purchase agreement date.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 1.875% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions originally covering 13,265,780 shares
of our Class A common stock at an initial price of $41.46 per share. Separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 1.875% Notes, we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire
13,265,780 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial exercise price of $67.37 per share. The convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, taken as a whole, effectively increase the conversion price of the 1.875%
Notes from $41.46 per share to $67.37 per share. As we cannot determine when, or whether, the 1.875% Notes will be converted, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, taken as a whole, minimize the dilution risk
associated with early conversion of the 1.875% Notes until such time that our Class A common stock is trading at a price above $67.37 per share (the upper strike of the warrants).

One of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the 1.875% Notes was with Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives
Inc. (“Lehman Derivatives”). The convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives covers 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of our Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes. In October 2008,
Lehman Derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The filing by Lehman Derivatives of a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition constituted an “event of default” under the
convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. As a result, on November 7, 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. Based on information available to us, we have no indication, as of the
date of filing this Form 10-K, that any party other than Lehman Derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the convertible note hedge transactions.

The net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives was recorded as an adjustment to Additional Paid in Capital
and did not have any impact on our consolidated balance sheet. However, we could incur significant costs to replace this hedge transaction if we elect to do so. If we do not elect



to replace the convertible note hedge transaction, then we will be subject to potential dilution upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes, if on the date of conversion the per share market price of
our Class A common stock exceeds the conversion price of $41.46.

At December 31, 2009, we had $550.0 million
outstanding of 1.875% Notes. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009, debt service for the next twelve months on the 1.875% Notes will be approximately $10.3 million.

4.0% Convertible Senior Notes

- On April 24, 2009, we issued $500.0 million of our 4.0% Notes in a private placement
transaction. Interest on the 4.0% Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1. The maturity date of the 4.0% Notes is October 1, 2014. The 4.0% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of our
Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 32.9164 shares of our Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 4.0% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of
approximately $30.38 per share or a 22.5% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $24.80 per share of our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on April 20, 2009, the purchase agreement date.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 4.0% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we purchased
from affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 4.0% Notes an option covering 16,458,196 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial price of $30.38 per share (the same as the initial conversion price of the notes). Separately and
concurrently with the pricing of the 4.0% Notes, we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold to affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 4.0% Notes warrants to acquire 16,458,196 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial
exercise price of $44.64 per share. We used approximately $61.6 million of the net proceeds from the 4.0% Notes offering plus the proceeds from the warrant transactions to fund the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions. The convertible
note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, taken as a whole, effectively increase the conversion price of the 4.0% Notes from $30.38 per share to $44.64 per share, reflecting a premium of 80% based on the closing stock price of $24.80 per
share of our Class A common stock on April 20, 2009. The remaining net proceeds of $376.6 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases or repayments of our outstanding debt.

As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding $500.0 million of our 4.0% Notes. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31,
2009, debt service for the next twelve months on the 4.0% Notes would be approximately $20.0 million.

Convertible Senior
Notes conversion options

- The 0.375% Notes, 1.875% Notes and 4.0% Notes (collectively “the Notes”) are convertible only under the following circumstances:

•

during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of Class A common stock on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter,

•

during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes
for each day in the measurement period was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate,

•

if specified distributions to holders of Class A common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur, and

•

at any time on or after October 12, 2010 for the 0.375% Notes, February 19, 2013 for the 1.875% Notes and July 22, 2014 for the 4.0%
Notes.



Upon conversion, we have the right to settle our conversion obligation in cash, shares of
Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock. From time to time, upon notice to the holders of the Notes, we may change our election regarding the form of consideration that we will use to settle our
conversion obligation; provided, however, that we are not permitted to change our settlement election after October 11, 2010 for the 0.375% Notes, February 18, 2010 for the 1.875% Notes and July 21, 2014 for the 4.0% Notes.

Senior Credit Facility

On July 24, 2009, SBA Senior Finance, Inc. entered into an Amendment and Restatement, dated as of July 24, 2009, of the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 18, 2008 (the “Restated Credit
Agreement”) for the $320.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Senior Credit facility”). The Senior Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on January 18, 2011. As of December 31, 2009, the availability under the Senior Credit
Facility was $319.9 million. As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any amounts outstanding under this facility and had approximately $0.1 million in letters of credit posted against the availability of this Senior Credit Facility. On February 11,
2010 the Senior Credit Facility was terminated.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility accrued interest at the
Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a Base Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) plus a margin that ranges from 50 basis points to 200 basis points, based upon the leverage ratio.
The weighted average interest rate for amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 2.46%.

The Restated Credit Agreement required SBA Senior Finance and SBA Communications to maintain specific financial ratios, including, at the SBA Senior Finance level, a Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized
Borrower EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) that did not exceed 5.0x for any fiscal quarter and an Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) of not less
than 2.0x for any fiscal quarter. In addition, our ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) for any fiscal quarter could not exceed 9.9x. The Restated Credit Agreement
also contained customary affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2009, SBA Senior Finance was in full compliance with the terms of the Senior Credit Facility.

Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to SBA or certain of our subsidiaries, the revolving credit
loans automatically would terminate and all amounts due under the Restated Credit Agreement and other loan documents would have become immediately due and payable. If certain other events of default occur, including failure to pay the principal and
interest when due, then, with the permission of a majority of the lenders, the revolving credit commitments would have terminated and all amounts due under the Restated Credit Agreement and other loan documents would have become immediately due and
payable.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility were secured by a first lien on substantially all of SBA Senior
Finance’s assets not pledged under the CMBS Certificates and substantially all of the assets, other than leasehold, easement or fee interests in real property, of SBA Senior Finance’s subsidiaries.



On February 11, 2010 the Senior Credit Facility was terminated.

2010 Credit Facility

On
February 11, 2010, SBA Senior Finance II, LLC (“SBA Senior Finance II”), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a credit agreement for a $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2010 Credit
Facility”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). Amounts borrowed under the 2010 Credit Facility will be secured by a first lien on
the capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, Inc., SBA Senior Finance, Inc. and SBA Senior Finance II (which now includes SBA Infrastructure Holdings I, Inc.), and substantially all of the assets, other than leasehold, easement or fee interests in
real property, of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of February 26, 2010, availability under the 2010 Credit Facility was $500.0 million.

The 2010 Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $500 million may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to
compliance with specific financial ratios and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Amounts borrowed under the 2010 Credit Facility accrue interest at the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that
ranges from 187.5 basis points to 237.5 basis points or at a Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin that ranges from 87.5 basis points to 137.5 basis points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to
Annualized Borrower EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). A 0.375% to 0.5% per annum fee is charged on the amount of unused commitment. If it is not terminated earlier by SBA Senior Finance II, the 2010 Credit Facility will terminate on,
and SBA Senior Finance II will repay all amounts outstanding on or before, February 11, 2015. Proceeds available under the 2010 Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.

The Credit Agreement requires SBA Senior Finance II and SBA Communications to maintain specific financial ratios, including, at the SBA
Senior Finance II level, a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) that does not exceed 5.0x for any fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net Hedge Exposure (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 5.0x for 30 consecutive days and a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) of not less than 2.0x for any fiscal quarter. In addition, our ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for any fiscal quarter on an annualized basis cannot exceed 8.9x. The
Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback
transactions or engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets.



The 2010 Credit Facility also permits us to request that one or more lenders
(1) increase their proportionate share of the 2010 Credit Facility commitment, up to an additional $200 million in the aggregate and (2) provide SBA Senior Finance II term loans for an aggregate amount up to $800 million, without
requesting consent of the other lenders. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such increase of the 2010 Credit Facility or term loans is subject to its compliance with the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement including, with
respect to any term loan, compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein. Upon SBA Senior Finance II’s request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of
its revolving credit facility commitment or whether to provide SBA Senior Finance II term loans and if so upon what terms. As of December 31, 2009, SBA Senior Finance II would have had the ability to request term loans up to an aggregate
principal amount of $325.0 million upon compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.

Optasite Credit Facility

On September 16, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Optasite, we assumed Optasite’s fully drawn $150 million senior credit
facility (the “Optasite Credit Facility”). We recorded the Optasite Credit Facility at its fair value of $147.0 million on the date of acquisition. Interest on the Optasite Credit Facility accrued at the one month Eurodollar Rate plus 165
basis points and interest payments were due monthly. Commencing November 1, 2008, we began paying the required installment payments on the Optasite Credit Facility. On July 31, 2009, we paid off the facility in full and the facility was
subsequently terminated.

Senior Notes

On July 24, 2009, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Telecommunications issued $750 million of unsecured Senior Notes, $375 million of which are due August 15, 2016 and $375 million of which are due
August 15, 2019. The 2016 Notes and the 2019 Notes are guaranteed by SBA.

The 2016 Notes have an interest rate of 8.00%
and were issued at a price of 99.330% of their face value. The 2019 Notes have an interest rate of 8.25% and were issued at a price of 99.152% of their face value. Interest on the 2016 Notes and 2019 Notes is due semi-annually on February 15,
and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2010.

The 2016 Notes and the 2019 Notes are subject to
redemption in whole or in part on or after August 15, 2012 and on or after August 15, 2014, respectively, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to August 15, 2012 for the
2016 Notes and August 15, 2014 for the 2019 Notes, we may at our option redeem all or a portion of the 2016 Notes or 2019 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a “make whole” premium plus
accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem up to 35% of the originally issued aggregate principal amount of each of the 2016 Notes and 2019 Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 108.000% and
108.250%, respectively, of the principal amount of the redeemed notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The Indenture
governing the 2016 Notes and the 2019 Notes contains customary covenants, subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications, including restrictions on Telecommunications’ ability to (1) incur additional indebtedness unless its
Consolidated Indebtedness to Annualized Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Indenture), pro forma for the additional indebtedness, does not exceed 7.0 times for the fiscal quarter, (2) merge, consolidate or sell assets,
(3) make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions, (4) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (5) enter into sale and leaseback transactions and restrictions on the ability of Telecommunications’
Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to incur liens securing indebtedness.

At December 31, 2009, we had
outstanding $375 million 2016 Senior Notes and $375 million 2019 Senior Notes. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009, debt service for the next twelve months on the



2016 Senior Notes and the 2019 Senior Notes will be approximately $30.0 million and $30.9 million, respectively.

Inflation

The impact of inflation on our operations has not been
significant to date. However, we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by long-term contracts with
pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and
estimated effects, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see “Note 2: Restatement for Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement” and “Note 4: Current Accounting Pronouncements” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Commitments and Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of December 31, 2009:

(1)

Represents interest payments based on the CMBS Certificates with a weighted average coupon fixed interest rate of 5.9%, the Convertible Senior Notes interest rate of
0.375%, 1.875% and 4.0%, and the Senior Notes interest rate of 8.0% and 8.25%.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These instruments arise from
transactions entered into in the normal course of business.

The following table presents the future principal payment
obligations and fair values associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of December 31, 2009:

(1)

The anticipated repayment date is November 2011 for the 2006 CMBS Certificates with a weighted average interest rate of 5.9%. The maturity date for the 2006 CMBS
Certificates is November 2036.

Our current primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk relating to
(1) the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to refinance the 2006 CMBS Certificates on its anticipated repayment date or at maturity at market rates, (2) our ability to meet financial covenants and (3) the impact of
interest rate movements on any borrowings that we may incur under our 2010 Credit Facility, which are all floating rate. We manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt. While we cannot
predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

- We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

In connection with the preparation of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2009, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting -

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and for performing an assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of SBA; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of SBA are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of SBA; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of SBA’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of SBA’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009
based upon criteria in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management determined that SBA’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009 based on the criteria in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered certified public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report
on SBA’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Certified Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries

We have audited SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May
Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (codified in FASB ASC Topic 470, Debt with Conversions and Other Options) effective as of January 1, 2009.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2010
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As of December 31, 2009, the Tower Companies owned and operated wireless communications towers in the Continental United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Space on these towers
is leased primarily to wireless service providers. As of December 31, 2009, the Company owned 8,324 tower sites.

Network
Services provides comprehensive turnkey services for the telecommunications industry in the areas of site development services for wireless carriers and the construction and repair of transmission towers. Site development consulting services include
(1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; and (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits. Site
construction services of the Company’s site development business provides a number of services, including, but not limited to the following: (1) tower and related site construction; (2) antenna installation; and (3) radio
equipment installation, commissioning and maintenance.

2. RESTATEMENT FOR ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company retrospectively adopted new convertible debt accounting which requires the issuer of certain
convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the
issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The Company’s 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2010 (“0.375% Notes”) and 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (“1.875% Notes” and collectively with the 0.375% Notes,
the “Notes”) are subject to the retroactive restatement required by the new convertible debt accounting. As a result of the adoption of the new convertible debt accounting, the Company recorded a debt discount and corresponding increase to
additional paid-in capital of approximately $74.4 million for the 0.375% Notes and approximately $163.0 million for the 1.875% Notes as of their dates of issuance (March 26, 2007 for the 0.375% Notes and May 16, 2008 for the 1.875% Notes). The
Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 has been retrospectively adjusted to reduce the carrying value of the 0.375% Notes and 1.875% Notes and reflect the conversion option as a reduction in shareholders’ equity.
In addition, as of their respective issuance dates, the Company reclassified, as a reduction to equity, deferred financing fees of $1.8 million and $3.8 million for the 0.375% Notes and 1.875% Notes, respectively, relating to debt issuance costs of
the equity component of the Notes. The Company’s consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect
the non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of the reduced carrying value of the Notes back to their full principal balance over the term of the Notes. In addition, the amortization of deferred financing fees has been restated to reflect
the amortization of the fees related only to the liability component of the Notes. See Note 13 for further information on the Notes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as
follows:

a

.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the Company and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

b

.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made by management relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the costs and revenue relating to the Company’s construction contracts, stock-based compensation, valuation allowance
related to deferred tax assets, fair value of long-lived assets, the useful lives of towers and intangible assets, anticipated property tax assessments, fair value of investments and asset retirement obligations. Management develops estimates based
on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available. These estimates ultimately may differ from actual results and such differences could be material.

c

.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash in banks, money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities with an
original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

d

.

Investments

Investment securities
with original maturities of more than three months but less than one year at time of purchase are considered short-term investments. The Company’s short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of less than
a year. Investment securities with maturities of more than a year are considered long-term investments and are classified in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Long-term investments primarily consist of U.S. Treasuries,
corporate bonds and auction rate securities. The auction rate securities have a fair value of approximately $1.0 million and a par value of $29.8 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and consist of 98 shares of FGIC Series C Perpetual
Preferred Stock, which were received in April 2009, and 800 shares of Ambac Preferred Stock, which were received in October 2008, as a result of both FGIC and Ambac exercising their put rights associated with the original auction rate security
investment (see Note 5 for fair value disclosures). Gross purchases and sales of the Company’s investments are presented within “Cash flows from investing activities” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

e

.

Restricted Cash

The Company classifies all cash pledged as collateral to secure certain obligations and all cash whose use is limited as restricted cash.
This includes cash held in escrow to fund certain reserve accounts relating to the CMBS Certificates, for payment and performance bonds, and surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company in the ordinary course of business (see Note 6).

F-11


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In connection with the issuance of the CMBS Certificates (as defined
in Note 13), the Company is required to fund a restricted cash amount, which represents the cash held in escrow pursuant to the mortgage loan agreement governing the CMBS Certificates. This restricted cash amount is used to fund certain reserve
accounts for the payment of debt service costs, ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums related to tower sites, trustee and servicing expenses, management fees and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants.
Pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan agreement, all rents and other sums due on the towers that secure the CMBS Certificates are directly deposited into a controlled deposit account by the lessees and are held by the indenture trustee. The
restricted cash held by the indenture trustee in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 13) on or before the 15

th

calendar day of the following month providing that the Company is in compliance with its debt service coverage ratio
and that no Event of Default has occurred. All monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash in current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

f

.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost or at estimated fair value (in case of acquired properties), adjusted for asset impairment and
estimated asset retirement obligations. Costs associated with the development and construction of towers are capitalized as a cost of the towers. Costs for self-constructed towers include direct materials and labor, indirect costs and capitalized
interest. Approximately $0.2 million of interest cost was capitalized in both 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Depreciation on
towers and related components is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, not to exceed the minimum lease term of the underlying ground lease. The Company defines the minimum lease term as the shorter of the period
from lease inception through the end of the term of all tenant lease obligations in existence at ground lease inception, including renewal periods, or the ground lease term, including renewal periods. If no tenant lease obligation exists at the date
of ground lease inception, the initial term of the ground lease is considered the minimum lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the minimum lease term of
the lease. For all other property and equipment, depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.

The Company performs ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on
the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset. If the useful lives of assets are reduced, depreciation may be accelerated in future years. Property and equipment under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease or the remaining estimated life of the leased property, whichever is shorter, and the related amortization is included in depreciation expense. Expenditures for maintenance and repair are expensed as incurred.

Asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows:

Towers and related components

3 - 15 years

Furniture, equipment and vehicles

2 - 7 years

Buildings and improvements

5 - 10 years

Betterments,
improvements and extraordinary repairs, which increase the value or extend the life of an asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset. Changes in an

F-12


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively, with the book value of the asset at
the time of the change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life. There has been no material impact for changes in estimated useful lives for any years presented.

g

.

Deferred Financing Fees

Financing fees related to the issuance of debt have been deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the
expected length of related indebtedness.

h

.

Deferred Lease Costs

The Company defers certain initial direct costs associated with the origination of tenant leases and lease amendments and amortizes these
costs over the initial lease term, generally five years, or over the lease term remaining if related to a lease amendment. Such deferred costs were approximately $4.0 million, $3.8 million, and $3.6 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
Amortization expense was $3.3 million, $2.7 million, and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is included in cost of site leasing on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, unamortized deferred lease costs were $8.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively, and are included in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

i

.

Intangible Assets

The Company classifies as intangible assets the fair value of current leases in place at the acquisition date of towers and related assets (referred to as the “current contract intangibles”),
and the fair value of future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the acquired towers (referred to as the “network location intangibles”). These intangibles are estimated to have an economic useful life consistent with the economic
useful life of the related tower assets, which is typically 15 years. For all intangible assets, amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as the benefit associated with these intangible assets is
anticipated to be derived evenly over the life of the asset.

j

.

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets

The Company records an impairment charge when the Company believes an investment in towers or related
assets has been impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site and related intangible. Estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include,
but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, the Company makes certain assumptions in determining an asset’s
fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.9 million and $0.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (see Note 17).

k

.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company determines the fair market values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established by the Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures accounting guidance, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

F-13


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

l.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related
lease agreements, which are generally five years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred
revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Site development projects in which the Company performs consulting services
include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which the Company performs work on a
fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, the Company recognizes the revenue
related to that phase. Site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete.

Revenue from construction
projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers
total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “costs and
estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted
contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers. The Company monitors collections and payments from its customers and
maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from
customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which
uncollectability is determined to be probable.

The following is a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007:

m.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of site leasing revenue includes ground lease rent, property taxes, maintenance (exclusive of employee related costs) and other tower
operating expenses. Liabilities recorded related to the straight-lining of ground leases are reflected in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of site development revenue includes the cost of materials, salaries and
labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle

F-14


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects. All costs related to site
development projects are recognized as incurred. All rental obligations due to be paid out over the minimum lease term, including fixed escalations, are recorded on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term.

n.

Income Taxes

The Company had taxable losses during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, and as a result, net operating loss carry-forwards have been generated. These net operating loss carry-forwards
are fully reserved as management believes it is not “more-likely-than-not” that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to recognize the losses.

The Company determines whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position taken in an income tax return will be sustained
upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is
measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The Company has not identified any tax exposures that require adjustment. In the future, to the extent that the Company records unrecognized tax exposures, any
related interest and penalties will be recognized as interest expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company does not calculate U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.

o.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock
options and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. The Company records compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the
date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The stock options granted to non-employees are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the market price of the underlying common stock on the “valuation
date,” which for options to non-employees is the vesting date. Expense related to the options granted to non-employees is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting
period.

p.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be
made, and accretes such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets, and over time, the liability is
accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the tower.

The Company has entered into ground leases for the land underlying the majority of the Company’s towers. A majority of these leases require the Company to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of the ground
lease. The asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was $4.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon settlement of the
obligations, any difference between the cost to retire an asset and the recorded liability is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain or loss. In determining the impact of the asset retirement obligations, the Company
considered the nature and scope of the contractual restoration obligations contained in the Company’s third party ground leases, the historical retirement experience as an indicator of

F-15


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

future restoration probabilities, intent in renewing existing ground leases through lease termination
dates, current and future value and timing of estimated restoration costs and the credit adjusted risk-free rate used to discount future obligations.

The following summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation liability:

q.

Loss Per Share

The Company has potential common stock equivalents related to its outstanding stock options and convertible senior notes. These potential
common stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive in calculating the full year earnings per share. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share and the weighted average
number of shares used in the computations are the same for all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

r.

Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity
(net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, and is comprised of net loss and “other comprehensive loss.” Comprehensive loss is presented in the
Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity.

s.

Foreign Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that do not utilize the United States dollar as its functional currency
are translated at period-end rates of exchange, while revenues and expenses are translated at monthly weighted average rates of exchange for the year. Unrealized translation gains and losses are reported as foreign currency translation adjustments
through other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.

t.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the
current year.

4. CURRENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-01, Amendments Based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 168 – The FASB Accounting

F-16


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“ASU
2009-01”), which states that the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Codification”) will become the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) recognized by the FASB. The codification
does not change existing GAAP but instead is a major restructuring of accounting and reporting standards designed to simplify user access to all authoritative GAAP by providing the authoritative literature in a topically organized structure. On the
effective date the Codification supersedes all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. The FASB will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements, instead it will issue accounting standard updates. ASU 2009-01 became
effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009 and the adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The FASB issued business combination accounting guidance which amends and clarifies the accounting for assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies. This accounting guidance is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

The FASB also issued business combinations accounting guidance which requires the acquiring entity in a business
combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition-date fair values and changes other practices some of which could have a material impact on how the Company accounts for business combinations. These
changes include, among other things, expensing acquisition costs as incurred as a component of operating expense. Effective January 1, 2009, these costs are reflected as acquisition related expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement
of operations. The Company historically capitalized these acquisition costs as part of the purchase price and then amortized these costs using the straight-line method over the life of the acquired intangible assets. This accounting guidance also
requires additional disclosure of information surrounding a business combination, such that users of the entity’s financial statements can fully understand the nature and financial impact of a business combination. This accounting guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this accounting guidance effective January 1, 2009.

The FASB issued accounting guidance for intangibles other than goodwill which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. This accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06,
Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (“ASU 2010-06”) which will require new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. The FASB also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of
disaggregation, inputs, and valuation techniques. ASU 2010-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2009. The Company will incorporate the disclosure requirements of ASU No. 2010-06 in the first quarter of 2010.

The FASB issued ASU No. 2009-05, Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value (“ASU 2009-05”). ASU 2009-05 amends fair
value accounting by providing additional guidance clarifying the measurement of liabilities at fair value. ASU 2009-05 addresses several key issues with respect to estimating the fair value of liabilities and clarifies how the price of a traded debt
security should be considered in estimating the fair value of the issuer’s liability. ASU 2009-05 became effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual reporting periods

ending after its issuance (August 2009). The adoption of ASU 2009-05 did not have a material impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The FASB issued fair value
accounting guidance which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. This accounting guidance is effective for interim
reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 and does not require disclosures for earlier periods presented for comparative purposes at initial adoption. The Company adopted this accounting guidance and have incorporated all applicable
disclosures.

The FASB issued fair value accounting guidance which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when
the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. This accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, and is applied prospectively. The adoption of
this accounting guidance did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The FASB issued fair value accounting guidance which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This accounting guidance
was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, FASB issued additional guidance which excluded leases and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease
classification or measurement. In addition the additional guidance delayed the effective date to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, or in fiscal 2009 for the Company, and interim periods within those fiscal years for fair
value measurements for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). In October 2008, the FASB issued
additional accounting guidance which clarifies the application of fair value measurements in an inactive market by providing an illustrative example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for the
financial asset is inactive. Effective January 1, 2008, the guidelines of fair value measurement were applied in recording the Company’s investments. Effective January 1, 2009, the guidelines of fair value measurements were applied to
non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities (see Note 5).

The FASB issued subsequent events accounting guidance which
established principles and requirements for disclosing subsequent events. This accounting guidance is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009, and is applied prospectively. The Company adopted this
accounting guidance.

The FASB issued accounting guidance on investment in debt and equity securities which changed the
existing accounting requirements for other-than-temporary impairments. This accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 and the adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

or cash flows.

The FASB issued consolidation accounting guidance which requires entities to report non-controlling (minority)
interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements. This accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this accounting guidance effective January 1, 2009
and the noncontrolling interests are reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity.

5. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

—The carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments that approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those
instruments primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. These financial instruments are valued using Level 1 inputs. Level 1 valuations rely on quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Long-term investments which are included in other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet consist of U.S.
treasuries, corporate bonds and auction rate securities (see Note 3 for additional information).

During the year ended
December 31, 2009, there were no changes in the fair value of the auction rate securities. The Company recorded $13.3 million of other–than–temporary impairment charges in other income (expense) on its Consolidated Statements of
Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company determined the other-than-temporary impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2008 based on a variety of factors, including the significant decline in fair value
indicated for the individual investments, the adverse market conditions impacting auction rate securities and the exercise of the put rights that resulted in the Company owning shares of FGIC Preferred Stock and shares of Ambac Preferred Stock.

The Company has estimated the fair value of these auction rate securities based on values provided by a third party valuation
firm utilizing a Level 3 valuation methodology. Level 3 valuations rely on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Management validated the
assumptions used in the valuation including the ultimate time horizon over which dividends are anticipated to be paid on the preferred stock, the coupon rate for these securities, and the appropriate discount margins. The Company continues to
monitor market and other conditions in assessing whether further changes in the fair value of these securities are warranted. Due to the lack of a market for Ambac Preferred Stock and FGIC Preferred Stock, the established fair value of these
securities is a matter of judgment. These estimated fair values could change based on future market conditions and as such, the Company may be required to record additional unrealized losses for impairment if the Company determines there are further
declines in their fair value.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the auction rate investments
that use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in thousands):

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

—The Company’s long-lived assets
(see Note 3), intangibles, asset retirement obligations (see Note 3) and earnouts related to acquisitions (see Note 7) are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using level 3 inputs. The fair value of the long-lived assets, intangibles and
asset retirement obligations are calculated using a discount cash flow model. The fair value of the earnouts is based on the estimated earnout payments. During the year ended December 31, 2009 the Company recorded a $3.9 million impairment on
its long-lived and intangible assets (see Note 17).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

—The carrying value
of the Company’s financial instruments, with the exception of long-term debt including current portion, reasonably estimate the related fair values as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

The following table reflects fair values, principal values and carrying values of the Company’s debt instruments. The Company
determines fair value of its debt securities utilizing various sources including quoted prices and indicative quotes (that is non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information including implied credit spreads for
similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices.

6. RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash consists of the following:

CMBS Certificates relate to cash held in escrow to fund certain reserve accounts relating to the
CMBS Certificates (see Note 3). Payment and performance bonds relate primarily to collateral requirements for tower construction currently in process by the Company. Cash is pledged as collateral related to surety bonds issued for the benefit of the
Company or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business and primarily related to the Company’s tower removal obligations. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $18.3 million in bonds for which it is only required to post $9.2
million in collateral. In addition, as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had pledged $2.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as collateral related to its workers compensation policy. These amounts are included in
other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

7. ACQUISITIONS

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company acquired 376 completed towers and related assets and liabilities from various
sellers and an interest in a Canadian entity whose holdings consisted of 52 towers and related assets and liabilities. The aggregate consideration paid for these towers and the equity interest and related assets was approximately $187.0 million,
consisting of $171.4 million of cash and approximately 642,000 shares of Class A common stock (excluding any working capital adjustments). The Company accounted for the above tower acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting. The
acquisitions are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition. The results of operations of the acquired assets are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. In addition, in 2009 as part of
the ground lease purchase program, the Company paid $4.2 million in cash for long-term lease extensions and $15.0 million for land and perpetual easement purchases, consisting of $11.6 million paid in cash and $3.4 million paid through the issuance
of approximately 143,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock.

On September 16, 2008, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company merged with Optasite Holding Company Inc. (“Optasite”) and Optasite became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As of the closing, Optasite owned 528 tower sites, located in 31 states, Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands and had approximately 38 managed site locations. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company issued 7.25 million shares of SBA Class A common stock to the Optasite security holders, assumed
Optasite’s fully-drawn $150 million senior credit facility (see Note 13) and assumed approximately $26.9 million of additional liabilities. The aggregate consideration paid for Optasite was approximately $433.3 million (excluding any working
capital adjustments). The results of operations of Optasite are included with those of the Company from the date of the acquisition.

On October 20, 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired Light Tower Wireless, LLC (“Light Tower”), the wireless infrastructure subsidiary of Light Tower, LLC. Light Tower became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company. As of the closing, Light Tower owned 340 wireless communications towers, five managed sites and five distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks. The aggregate purchase price paid for

F-21


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

these towers and related assets was approximately $224.0 million (excluding any working capital
adjustments) which was paid in cash. The results of operations of Light Tower are included with those of the Company from the date of the acquisition.

In addition to the Optasite and Light Tower acquisitions, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company acquired 587 completed towers (including 423 towers from the TowerCo, LLC acquisition)
and related assets and liabilities from various sellers as well as the equity interest of six entities, whose holdings consisted of 114 towers and related assets and liabilities. The aggregate consideration paid for these towers and related assets
was $479.6 million, consisting of $441.1 million in cash and approximately 1.2 million shares of Class A common stock valued at $38.5 million (excluding any working capital adjustments). The Company accounted for all of the above tower
acquisitions at fair market value at the date of each acquisition. The results of operations of the acquired assets are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Also, during 2008, the Company paid in cash
$19.9 million for land and easement purchases and $3.3 million for long-term lease extensions related to the land underneath the Company’s towers.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company acquired 529 completed towers, related assets and liabilities from various sellers as well as the equity interest of three entities, whose assets
consisted of approximately 83 towers and related assets and liabilities. The aggregate net consideration paid for these additional assets was $330.0 million, consisting of $166.3 million in cash and approximately 4.7 million shares of
Class A common stock valued at $163.7 million (excluding any working capital adjustments). The Company accounted for all of the above tower acquisitions at fair market value at the date of each acquisition. The results of operations of the
acquired assets are included with those of the Company from the dates of their respective acquisitions. Also, during 2007, the Company paid in cash $23.4 million for land and easement purchases in addition to $10.9 million spent for long-term lease
extensions related to the land underneath the Company’s towers.

The acquisitions consummated were not significant to the
Company and accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented. The Company continues to evaluate all acquisitions within one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments
are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption, as well as the separate recognition of intangible assets from goodwill if certain criteria are met. These
intangible assets represent the value associated with current leases in place at the acquisition date (“Current Contract Intangibles”) and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the acquired towers (“Network Location
Intangible”) and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows. The intangible assets are estimated to have an economic useful life consistent with the economic useful life of the related tower assets,
which is typically 15 years.

From time to time, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration in connection with its
acquisitions if the towers or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets in the one to three years after they have been acquired. In certain acquisitions, the additional consideration may be paid in cash or shares of
Class A common stock at the Company’s option (see Note 20). The Company accrues for contingent consideration at fair value based on the expected contingent payments. Prior to January 1, 2009, the Company recorded such obligations as
additional consideration when it became probable that the targets would be met.

Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the
Company acquired 14 towers from third party sellers and an equity interest in DAS provider Extenet Systems, inc. in exchange for $42.9 million in cash and a contribution of the Company’s six DAS networks.

The CMBS
Certificates

Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-1

On November 18, 2005, an indirect subsidiary of SBA Communications established a trust (the “Trust”), which sold in a private
transaction, $405.0 million of 2005 CMBS Certificates, Series 2005-1 (the “2005 CMBS Certificates”).

The 2005 CMBS
Certificates consisted of five classes with annual pass-through interest rates ranging from 5.369% to 6.706%. The weighted average annual fixed coupon interest rate of the 2005 CMBS Certificates was 5.6%, payable monthly, and the effective weighted
average annual fixed interest rate was 4.8%, after giving effect to the settlement of two interest rate swap agreements entered into in contemplation of the transaction (see Note 14).

On July 28, 2009, the Company repaid the remaining principal balance of $380.2 million of the 2005 CMBS Certificates and paid $10.1
million for related prepayment consideration plus accrued interest and fees. During the year ended December 31, 2009, but prior to the payoff of the principal balance, the Company repurchased an

aggregate of $18.6 million, in principal amount of 2005 CMBS Certificates for $16.6 million in cash. The
Company recorded in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 a $7.2 million net loss on the early extinguishment of debt. During 2008, the Company repurchased an aggregate of $6.2 million in principal
amount of the 2005 CMBS Certificates for $5.5 million in cash. The Company recorded in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 a $0.7 million gain on early extinguishment of debt.

Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-1

On November 6, 2006, the Trustee issued in a private transaction $1.15 billion of 2006 CMBS Certificates, Series 2006-1 (the “2006 CMBS Certificates” and collectively with the 2005 CMBS
Certificates referred to as the “CMBS Certificates”).

The 2006 CMBS Certificates consist of nine classes with
annual pass-through interest rates ranging from 5.314% to 7.825%. The weighted average annual fixed coupon interest rate of the 2006 CMBS Certificates at December 31, 2009 was 5.9%, payable monthly, and the effective weighted average annual
fixed interest rate was 6.2% after giving effect to the settlement of the nine interest rate swap agreements entered into in contemplation of the transaction (see Note 14). The 2006 CMBS Certificates have an anticipated repayment date in November
2011 with a final repayment date in 2036.

During the year ended 2009, the Company repurchased an aggregate of $150.1 million
in principal amount of 2006 CMBS Certificates for $150.5 million in cash. The Company recorded in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 a $2.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt. During

gain on early extinguishment of debt.

Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased an aggregate of $2.0
million in principal amount of 2006 CMBS Certificates for $2.1 million in cash.

The assets of the Trust, which issued both
the 2005 CMBS Certificates and the 2006 CMBS Certificates, consist of a non-recourse mortgage loan initially made in favor of SBA Properties as the initial borrower. In connection with the issuance of the 2006 CMBS Certificates, each of SBA Sites,
Inc., SBA Structures, Inc., SBA Towers, Inc., SBA Puerto Rico, Inc. and SBA Towers USVI, Inc. were added as additional borrowers under the mortgage loan and the principal amount of the mortgage loan was increased by $1.15 billion to an aggregate of
$1.56 billion.

On July 28, 2009, in connection with the repayment of the 2005 CMBS Certificates, SBA Towers, Inc., SBA
Puerto Rico, Inc. and SBA Towers USVI, Inc. were released from their obligations under the mortgage loan underlying the CMBS Certificates. Effective July 28, 2009, SBA Properties Inc., SBA Sites, Inc., and SBA Structures, Inc., (the
“Borrowers”) were the remaining borrowers under the mortgage loan and the mortgage loan is to be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 3,746 tower sites owned by the Borrowers (the “CMBS Towers”). Subject to
certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made in relation to the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the 2006 CMBS Certificates prior to November 2011, which is the anticipated
repayment date for the remaining components of the mortgage loan. The Borrowers are special purpose vehicles which exist solely to hold the towers which are subject to the securitization. The Borrowers are jointly and severally liable under the
mortgage loan.

F-28


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The mortgage loan consists of multiple tranches, or components, each of which has terms
that are identical to the subclass of CMBS Certificates to which it relates. Any time prior to November 2011, the Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the 2006 CMBS
Certificates upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. The prepayment consideration is determined per class and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value on the date of prepayment of all future
installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date that is nine months prior to the anticipated repayment date, assuming the entire unpaid principal amount of such class is
required to be paid, over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment. If the prepayment occurs (i) within nine months of the anticipated repayment date, (ii) with proceeds received
as a result of any condemnation or casualty of the Borrowers’ sites or (iii) during an amortization period, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan components corresponding to the 2006
CMBS Certificates will be due in November 2036. However, to the extent that the full amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the 2006 CMBS Certificates are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest
rate of each component would increase by the greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage
loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.

The mortgage loan is secured by
(1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the CMBS tower sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures,
(3) the Borrowers’ rights under the management agreement they entered into with SBA Network Management, Inc. (“SBA Network Management”), relating to the management of the Borrowers’ tower sites by SBA Network Management
pursuant to which SBA Network Management arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on the Borrowers’ behalf,
(4) the Borrowers’ rights under certain site management agreements, (5) the Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases, (6) the pledge by SBA CMBS-1 Guarantor, LLC and SBA CMBS-1 Holdings, LLC of equity interests of the
initial borrower and SBA CMBS-1 Guarantor, LLC, (7) the various deposit accounts and collection accounts of the Borrowers and (8) all proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar month, SBA Network Management is entitled to receive a
management fee equal to 7.5% of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.

In
connection with the issuance of the CMBS Certificates, the Company established a deposit account into which all rents and other sums due on the CMBS Towers are directly deposited by the lessees and are held by the indenture trustee. The monies held
by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 6). However, if the debt service coverage ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the Mortgage
Loan Agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30 times or
lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as
“excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30 times for
two consecutive calendar quarters. If the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15 times as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied
to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter. As of December 31, 2009, the Borrowers met the required debt service coverage ratio as defined by the mortgage loan
agreement.

quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the
applicable conversion price per share of Class A common stock on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter, (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of a 0.375%
Note for each day in the measurement period was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate, (3) if specified distributions to holders of Class A common stock
are made or specified corporate transactions occur, and (4) at any time on or after October 12, 2010.

Upon
conversion, the Company has the right to settle the conversion of each $1,000 principal amount of 0.375% Notes with any of the three following alternatives, at its option, delivery of (1) 29.7992 shares of the Company’s Class A common
stock, (2) cash equal to the value of 29.7992 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock calculated at the market price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock at the time of conversion or (3) a combination of
cash and shares of our Class A common stock.

The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $341.4 million after
deducting discounts, commissions and expenses. A portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 0.375% Notes was used to repurchase approximately 3.24 million shares of Class A common stock, valued at approximately $91.2 million based on
the closing stock price of $28.20 on March 20, 2007. These repurchased shares were immediately retired by the Company. The repurchased shares were recorded as a reduction to Class A common stock for the par value of the Class A common
stock as well as an increase to accumulated deficit on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Concurrently with the
sale of the 0.375% Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of two of the initial purchasers of the 0.375% Notes. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions is $33.56 per share of
the Company’s Class A common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 0.375% Notes) and is similarly subject to certain customary adjustments. The convertible note hedge transactions cover 10,429,720 shares of Class A
common stock. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $77.2 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 0.375% Notes and the warrants discussed below were used to pay for the cost of the convertible note hedge
transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Separately and concurrently with entering into the convertible note hedge transactions, the Company entered into warrant transactions
whereby the Company sold warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire 10,429,720 shares of Class A common stock at an initial exercise price of $55.00 per share. The aggregate

warrants were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company consummated privately negotiated exchanges of the 0.375% Notes for Class A common stock in reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pursuant to these
exchanges, the Company issued approximately 618,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in exchange for $12.5 million in principal amount of 0.375% Notes. In addition, the Company also repurchased an aggregate of $95.2 million in

In April 2009,
the Company also terminated the portion of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions that it entered into in March 2007 with respect to its 0.375% Notes which related to the $264.1 million principal amount of 0.375% Notes that the Company
previously repurchased for cash or stock. The Company received a net settlement of approximately 546,000 shares from the counterparties of the hedge and warrant transactions.

The Company is amortizing the debt discount on the 0.375% Notes utilizing the effective interest method over the life of the 0.375% Notes
which increases the effective interest rate of the 0.375% Notes from its coupon rate of 0.375% to 6.9%. The Company incurred cash interest expense of $0.2 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. The Company recorded non-cash interest expense of $3.7 million, $17.2 million and $14.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of the
equity component related to the 0.375% Notes was $60.1 million.

1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013

On May 16, 2008, the Company issued $550.0 million of its 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “1.875% Notes”). Interest is
payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. The 1.875% Notes have a maturity date of May 1, 2013. The Company incurred fees of $12.9 million with the issuance of the 1.875% Notes of which $9.1 million was recorded as deferred
financing fees and $3.8 million was recorded as a reduction of shareholders’ equity.

The 1.875% Notes are convertible,
at the holder’s option, into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 24.1196 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes (subject to certain customary
adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $41.46 per share or a 20% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $34.55 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market
on May 12, 2008, the purchase agreement date. The 1.875% Notes are convertible only under the following certain circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing at any time after June 30, 2008 and only during such calendar
quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the
applicable conversion price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter, (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the
trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes for each day in the measurement period was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate,
(3) if specified distributions to holders of the Company’s Class A common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur, and (4) at any time on or after February 19, 2013.

Upon conversion, the Company has the right to settle the conversion of each $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes with any of the three
following alternatives, at its option: delivery of (1) 24.1196 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, (2) cash equal to the value of 24.1196 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock calculated at the market
price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock at the time of conversion or (3) a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock.

The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $536.8 million after deducting discounts, commissions and expenses. A portion of the
net proceeds from the sale of the 1.875% Notes was used to repurchase and retire approximately 3.47 million shares of Class A common stock, valued at $120.0 million based on the closing stock price of $34.55 on May 12, 2008. The
repurchased shares were recorded as a reduction to Class A common stock for the par value of the Class A common stock as well as an increase to accumulated deficit on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 1.875% Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of four of
the initial purchasers of the 1.875% Notes. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions is $41.46 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 1.875% Notes) and is
similarly subject to certain customary adjustments. The convertible note hedge transactions originally covered 13,265,780 shares of Class A common stock. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $137.7 million. A portion of the
net proceeds from the sale of the 1.875% Notes and the warrant transactions discussed below were used to pay for the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was recorded as a reduction to
additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Separately and concurrently with entering into
the convertible note hedge transactions, the Company entered into warrant transactions whereby the Company sold warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire an aggregate of 13,265,780 shares of Class A common stock at an initial
exercise price of $67.37 per share. The

F-32

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

aggregate proceeds from the warrant transactions were $56.2 million. The proceeds from issuance of the
warrants were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

One of
the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the 1.875% Notes was with Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (“Lehman Derivatives”). The convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives covers 55% of the
13,265,780 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes. In October 2008, Lehman Derivatives filed a motion for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The
filing by Lehman Derivatives of a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition constituted an “event of default” under the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. As a result, on November 7, 2008 the Company terminated
the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. Based on information available to the Company, there is no indication, as of the date of filing this Form 10-K, that any party other than Lehman Derivatives would be unable to fulfill
their obligations under the convertible note hedge transactions.

The net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction with
Lehman Derivatives was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital and therefore the “event of default” did not have any impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. However, the Company could incur
significant costs to replace this hedge transaction if it elects to do so. If the Company does not elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction, then the Company would be subject to potential dilution or additional cost (depending on if
the note is settled with shares or cash) upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes, if on the date of conversion the per share market price of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeded the conversion price of $41.46.

The Company is amortizing the debt discount on the 1.875% Notes utilizing the effective interest method over the life of the 1.875% Notes
which increases the effective interest rate of the 1.875% Notes from its coupon rate of 1.875% to 9.4%. The Company incurred cash interest expense of $10.3 million and $6.5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively and non-cash interest expense of $28.7 million and $16.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of the equity component related to the 1.875% Notes
was $159.2 million.

The 1.875% Notes are reflected in long-term debt in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at
carrying value. The following table summarizes the balances for the 1.875% Notes:

4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014

On April 24, 2009, the Company issued $500.0 million of its 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes (“4.0% Notes”) in a private placement transaction. Interest on the 4.0% Notes is payable
semi-annually on April 1 and October 1. The maturity date of the 4.0% Notes is October 1, 2014. The Company incurred fees of $11.7 million with the issuance of the 4.0% Notes of which $7.7 million was recorded as deferred financing
fees and $4.0 million was recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity.

F-33


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The 4.0% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of the
Company’s Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 32.9164 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 4.0% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion
price of approximately $30.38 per share or a 22.5% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $24.80 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on April 20, 2009, the purchase
agreement date. The 4.0% Notes are convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing at any time after June 30, 2009 and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the
Company’s Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of
Class A common stock on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000
principal amount of notes for each day in the measurement period was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate; (3) if specified distributions
to holders of the Company’s Class A common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur; or (4) at any time on or after July 22, 2014. Upon conversion, the Company has the right to settle its conversion obligation in
cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common stock. From time to time, upon notice to the holders of the 4.0% Notes, the Company may change its election regarding the form of consideration
that the Company will use to settle its conversion obligation; provided, however, that the Company is not permitted to change its settlement election after July 21, 2014.

The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $488.2 million after deducting discounts, commissions and expenses. Contemporaneously
with the closing of the sale of the 4.0% Notes, a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 4.0% Notes was used to repurchase 2.0 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, valued at $50.0 million based on the
closing stock price of $24.80 on April 20, 2009. These repurchased shares were immediately retired by the Company. The repurchased shares will be recorded as a reduction to Class A common stock for the par value of the Class A common
stock as well as an increase to accumulated deficit.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 4.0% Notes, the Company entered
into convertible note hedge transactions whereby the Company purchased from affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the 4.0% Notes an option covering 16,458,196 shares of its Class A common stock at an initial strike price of $30.38
per share (the same as the initial conversion price of the notes). Separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 4.0% Notes, the Company entered into warrant transactions whereby it sold to affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of
the 4.0% Notes warrants to acquire 16,458,196 shares of its Class A common stock at an initial price of $44.64 per share. The Company used approximately $61.6 million of the net proceeds from the 4.0% Notes offering plus the proceeds from the
warrant transactions to fund the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions. The convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, taken as a whole, effectively increase the conversion price of the 4.0% Notes from $30.38 per
share to $44.64 per share, reflecting a premium of 80% based on the closing stock price of $24.80 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock on April 20, 2009. The remaining net proceeds of $376.6 million were used for general
corporate purposes, including repurchases or repayments of the Company’s outstanding debt.

The Company is amortizing the
debt discount on the 4.0% Notes utilizing the effective interest method over the life of the 4.0% Notes which increases the effective interest rate of the 4.0% Notes from its coupon rate of 4.0% to 13.0%. The Company incurred cash interest expense
of $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and non-cash interest expense of $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of the equity component related to the 4.0% Notes
was $169.0 million.

The 4.0% Notes are reflected in long-term debt in the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheets at carrying value. The following table summarizes the balances for the 4.0% Notes:

Senior Notes

On July 24, 2009, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Telecommunications issued $750 million of unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes”), $375 million of which are due August 15,
2016 (“2016 Notes”) and $375 million of which are due August 15, 2019 (“2019 Notes”). The 2016 Notes have an interest rate of 8.00% and were issued at a price of 99.330% of their face value. The 2019 Notes have an interest
rate of 8.25% and were issued at a price of 99.152% of their face value. Interest on the 2016 Notes and 2019 Notes is due semi-annually on February 15, and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2010. Net proceeds of this
offering were $727.9 million after deducting expenses and original issue discount.

Telecommunications used the net proceeds
from this offering to repay the 2005 CMBS Certificates issued by its subsidiary and the related prepayment consideration, repay the Senior Credit Facility and repay and terminate the Optasite Credit Facility. Telecommunications also intends to
repurchase prior to maturity or repay at maturity SBA’s outstanding 0.375% Notes. The remaining net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes.

The 2016 Notes and the 2019 Notes are subject to redemption in whole or in part on or after August 15, 2012 and on or after August 15, 2014, respectively, at the redemption prices set forth in
the indenture agreement plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to August 15, 2012 for the 2016 Notes and August 15, 2014 for the 2019 Notes, Telecommunications may at its option redeem all or a portion of the 2016 Notes or 2019 Notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a “make whole” premium plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, Telecommunications may redeem up to 35% of the originally issued aggregate principal amount of each
of the 2016 Notes and 2019 Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 108.000% and 108.250%, respectively, of the principal amount of the redeemed notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The Company is amortizing the debt discount on the 2016 Notes and the 2019 Notes utilizing the effective interest method over the life of
the 2016 Notes and 2019 Notes, respectively. The Company incurred cash interest expense of $13.1 million and non-cash interest expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, related to the 2016 Notes. The Company incurred cash
interest expense of $13.5 million and non-cash interest expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, related to the 2019 Notes.

The Indenture governing the Senior Notes contains customary covenants, subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications, including restrictions on Telecommunications’ ability to (1) incur
additional indebtedness unless its Consolidated Indebtedness to Annualized Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Indenture), pro forma for the additional indebtedness does not exceed 7.0 times for the fiscal quarter, (2) merge,
consolidate or sell assets, (3) make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions, (4) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (5) enter into sale and leaseback transactions and restrictions on the ability of

The Company is a holding company with no business operations of its own. The
Company’s only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of Telecommunications. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes issued by Telecommunications. The Company and Telecommunications have agreed to file
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to which Telecommunications will either offer to exchange each series of notes for substantially similar registered notes of the respective series or
register the resale of the respective series of notes. The Company intends to consummate the exchange offer by July 19, 2010. To the extent that the exchange offer has not been consummated by July 19, 2010, the interest rate on the 2016 Notes
and the 2019 Notes will increase 0.25% per annum for each 90-day period that the exchange offer has not been consummated following such date up to a maximum of 1.00% per annum.

Senior Credit Facility

On January 18, 2008, SBA Senior Finance, Inc.
(“SBA Senior Finance”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $285.0 million Senior Credit Facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from
time to time parties to the credit agreement. On March 5, 2008, SBA Senior Finance entered into a new lender supplement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group in connection with the Senior Credit Facility, which increased the aggregate
commitment of the lenders to $335.0 million. The Company incurred deferred financing fees of $2.8 million associated with the closing of this transaction.

In September 2008, the Company made a drawing request under the Senior Credit Facility and Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. (“LCPI”), who was a lender under the Senior Credit Facility, did not fund
its share of such request. As a result of such failure to fund, SBA delivered a letter to LCPI declaring that LCPI was in default of its obligations under the Senior Credit Facility agreement. In October 2008, LCPI filed a voluntary petition for
protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. LCPI, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. had committed $50.0 million of the original aggregate of $335.0 million in commitments under the Senior Credit Facility. As a
result, the aggregate commitment of the Senior Credit Facility was reduced to $285.0 million. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of LCPI, the Company has written off unamortized deferred financing fees of $0.4 million in its Consolidated Statement
of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Effective April 14, 2009, SBA Senior Finance entered into a New
Lender Supplement with Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”). The New Lender Supplement added Barclays as a lender under the Senior Credit Facility and increased the aggregate commitment under the Senior Credit Facility from $285.0 million to
$320.0 million, the availability of which is based on compliance with certain financial ratios. All other terms of the Senior Credit Facility remained the same.

Effective July 31, 2009, SBA Senior Finance entered into an Amendment and Restatement of the Credit Agreement (the “Restated Credit Agreement”). The Restated Credit Agreement primarily
mirrors the material terms of the Senior Credit Facility and clarifies that the credit facility was scheduled to terminate on January 18, 2011. All other changes to the Senior Credit Facility have been incorporated within this disclosure.

The Senior Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with the financial and other covenants
in the Restated Credit Agreement. Proceeds available under the facility may be used for the construction or acquisition of towers and for ground lease buyouts, and general corporate purposes including distributions to Telecommunications. Amounts
borrowed under the facility accrue interest at the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a Base Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) plus a margin that ranges from 50 basis points to
200 basis points, in each case based on the Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement and discussed below). A 0.5% per annum fee is charged on the amount of unused commitment.

F-36


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Restated Credit Agreement requires SBA Senior Finance and SBA Communications to
maintain specific financial ratios, including, at the SBA Senior Finance level, a Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) that does not exceed 5.0x for any fiscal quarter and an
Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0x for any fiscal quarter. In addition, the Company’s ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) for any fiscal quarter cannot exceed 9.9x. The Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit SBA Senior
Finance’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions or merge or consolidate, or engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of our
assets. As of December 31, 2009, SBA Senior Finance was in full compliance with the terms of the Senior Credit Facility.

Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to the Company or certain of our subsidiaries, the revolving credit loans automatically terminate and all amounts due under the Restated Credit Agreement and other
loan documents become immediately due and payable. If certain other events of default occur, including failure to pay the principal and interest when due, a breach of the Company’s negative covenants, or failure to perform any other requirement
in the Restated Credit Agreement, the Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (as described below) and/or certain other debt instruments, including the Notes and the CMBS Certificates, then, with the permission of a majority of the lenders, the
revolving credit commitments will terminate and all amounts due under the Restated Credit Agreement and other loan documents become immediately due and payable.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility will be secured by a first lien on substantially all of SBA Senior Finance’s assets not pledged under the CMBS Certificates and substantially all of
the assets, other than leasehold, easement or fee interests in real property, of the guarantors. In connection with the Restated Credit Agreement, on July 28, 2009, SBA Communications, Telecommunications, SBA Senior Finance and certain of SBA
Senior Finance’s subsidiaries, entered into an Amendment and Restatement of the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement in favor of Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, as administrative agent (the “Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement”).
The Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement clarifies that only subsidiaries of SBA Senior Finance, rather than of SBA Communications (other than Telecommunications), are required to guarantee SBA Senior Finance’s obligations under the
credit facility and added SBA Towers, Inc., SBA Puerto Rico, Inc. and SBA Towers USVI, Inc. as guarantors, as each of these entities had been released from its obligations under the mortgage loan underlying the CMBS Certificates.

During 2009, SBA Senior Finance borrowed $8.5 million and repaid $239.1 million under its senior credit facility, which is presented within
“Cash flows from financing activities” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company used or designated such proceeds for construction and acquisition of towers and for ground lease buyouts. As of
December 31, 2009, the Company did not have any amounts outstanding under this facility. The Company had approximately $0.1 million of letters of credit posted against the availability of this credit facility outstanding. The weighted average
interest rate for amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 2.46% and 4.3%, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, availability under the credit facility was approximately $319.9
million.

On February 11, 2010, the Company terminated the Senior Credit Facility.

2010 Credit Facility

On
February 11, 2010, SBA Senior Finance II, LLC (“SBA Senior Finance II”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement for a $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2010
Credit Facility”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time

parties to the credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). Amounts borrowed under the 2010
Credit Facility will be secured by a first lien on the capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, Inc., SBA Senior Finance, Inc. and SBA Senior Finance II, and substantially all of the assets, other than leasehold, easement or fee interests in real
property, of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Company incurred deferred financing fees of $4.8 million associated with the closing of this transaction. As of February 26, 2010,
availability under the 2010 Credit Facility was $500.0 million.

The 2010 Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under
which up to $500 million may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with specific financial ratios and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Amounts borrowed under the 2010
Credit Facility accrue interest at the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 187.5 basis points to 237.5 basis points or at a Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin that ranges from 87.5 basis points to 137.5 basis
points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). A 0.375% to 0.5% per annum fee is charged on the amount of unused commitment. If it is not earlier terminated
by SBA Senior Finance II, the 2010 Credit Facility will terminate on, and SBA Senior Finance II will repay all amounts outstanding on or before, February 11, 2015. Proceeds available under the 2010 Credit Facility may be used for general
corporate purposes.

The Credit Agreement requires SBA Senior Finance II and SBA Communications to maintain specific financial
ratios, including, at the SBA Senior Finance II level, a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) that does not exceed 5.0x for any fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net
Hedge Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 5.0x for 30 consecutive days and a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0x for any fiscal quarter. In addition, the Company’s ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for any fiscal quarter on an
annualized basis cannot exceed 8.9x. The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain
investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions or engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets.

The 2010 Credit Facility also permits the Company to request that one or more lenders (1) increase their proportionate share of the 2010 Credit Facility commitment, up to an additional $200 million
in the aggregate and (2) provide SBA Senior Finance II term loans for an aggregate amount up to $800 million, without requesting consent of the other lenders. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such increase of the 2010 Credit
Facility or term loans is subject to its compliance with the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement including, with respect to any term loan, compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein. Upon SBA
Senior Finance II’s request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its revolving credit facility commitment or whether to provide SBA Senior Finance II term loans and if so upon what terms. As
of December 31, 2009, had the 2010 Credit Facility been in place, SBA Senior Finance II would have had the ability to request term loans up to an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million upon compliance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement.

Optasite Credit Facility

On September 16, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Optasite, the Company assumed Optasite’s fully drawn $150 million senior credit facility (the “Optasite Credit Facility”).
The Company recorded the Optasite Credit Facility at its fair value of $147.0 million on the date of acquisition. Interest on the Optasite Credit Facility accrued at the one month Eurodollar Rate plus 165 basis points and interest payments were due
monthly. Commencing November 1, 2008, the Company began paying the required installment payments on the Optasite

Credit Facility. On July 31, 2009, the Company paid off the facility in full and the facility was
subsequently terminated. The Company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million.

The Company
incurred cash interest expense of $1.8 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company incurred non-cash interest expense of $0.8 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively.

14. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT

Optasite Derivative Instruments

The Company acquired various derivative
instruments as part of the Optasite acquisition on September 16, 2008 which were valued at $4.4 million. The derivative instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company terminated the majority of the derivative instruments on
October 3, 2008 for $3.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized a net gain of $0.5 million on these derivatives, which is included in interest expense on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

2006 CMBS Certificate Swaps

During 2006, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into nine forward-starting swap agreements (the “2006 CMBS Certificate Swaps”) in anticipation of the 2006 CMBS
Transaction. In October 2006, the Company terminated the 2006 CMBS Certificate Swaps in connection with entering into the purchase and sale agreement for the 2006 CMBS Certificates (see Note 13). The Company determined a portion of the swaps to be
an effective cash flow hedge and as a result, recorded a deferred loss of $12.8 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred loss is being amortized
utilizing the effective interest method over the anticipated five year life of the 2006 CMBS Certificates and increases the effective interest rate on these certificates by 0.3%.

The Company recorded amortization of $2.3 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million as non-cash interest expense on the Company’s
Consolidated Statements of Operations for year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

2005 CMBS Certificate Swaps

On June 22, 2005, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into two forward-starting interest rate swap
agreements (the “2005 CMBS Certificate Swaps”) in anticipation of the 2005 CMBS Transaction. On November 4, 2005, the Company entered into a purchase agreement regarding the purchase and sale of 2005 CMBS Certificates (see Note 13).
In connection with this agreement, the Company terminated the 2005 CMBS Certificate Swaps. The Company determined the swaps to be an effective cash flow hedge and as a result, recorded a deferred gain of $14.8 million in accumulated other
comprehensive loss, net of applicable income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred gain was being amortized utilizing the effective interest method over the anticipated five year life of the 2005 CMBS Certificates and
reduced the effective interest rate on these certificates by 0.8%. On July 28, 2009, the Company recognized the remaining unamortized net deferred gain of $3.9 million in connection with the repayment of the 2005 CMBS Certificates.

The Company recorded amortization of $1.7 million, $3.0 million and $2.8 million as an offset to non-cash interest expense on the
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

15. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Common Stock equivalents

The Company has potential common stock
equivalents related to its outstanding stock options (see Note 16) and Convertible Senior Notes (see Note 13). These potential common stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive for
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share and the weighted average number of shares used in the computation are the same for the years presented.

Stock Repurchases

The Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective November 3, 2009. This program authorizes the Company to purchase, from time to time, up to $250.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common
stock through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and/or in privately negotiated transactions at management’s discretion based on market and business conditions, applicable legal
requirements and other factors. This program will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by the Company’s Board of Directors at any time in the Company’s sole discretion. In connection with the stock repurchase program, in
December 2009, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 52,000 shares for an aggregate of $1.7 million including commissions and fees.

In April 2009, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 2.0 million shares, valued at approximately $50.0 million based on the closing stock price of $24.80 on April 20, 2009, in
connection with the issuance of the 4.0% Notes (See Note 13).

In May 2008, the Company repurchased and retired approximately
3.47 million shares, valued at approximately $120.0 million based on the closing stock price of $34.55 on May 12, 2008, in connection with the issuance of the 1.875% Notes (See Note 13).

In March 2007, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 3.24 million shares valued at approximately $91.2 million based on the
closing price of $28.20 on March 20, 2007, in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% Notes (see Note 13).

Subsequent
to December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased 207,000 shares for an aggregate of $6.7 million including commissions and fees.

Registration of Additional Shares

The Company filed shelf registration statements on Form S-4 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission registering 4.0 million, 4.0 million, 5.0 million and 3.0 million of its Class A common stock in 2007, 2006, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These shares may be issued in connection with

On November 27, 2006, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission registering an additional 2.5 million shares of its Class A common stock issuable under the 2001 Equity Participation Plan.

On March 3, 2009, the Company filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers on
Form S-3ASR. This registration statement enables the Company to issue shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, preferred stock or debt securities either separately or represented by warrants, or depositary shares as well as units that
include any of these securities. Under the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements, the Company will file a prospectus supplement and advise the Commission of the amount and type of securities each time the Company issue securities
under this registration statement. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company did not issue any securities under this automatic shelf registration statement.

On May 17, 2007, the Company filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 registering the resale by selling security holders of our 0.375% Notes and shares of our
Class A Common Stock which are issuable upon conversion of the 0.375% Notes. The 0.375% Notes were originally issued in a private placement on March 26, 2007 (see Note 13).

Other Common Stock Transactions

During 2008, in connection with the
Optasite acquisition, the Company issued 7.25 million shares of its Class A common stock.

Shareholder Rights Plan and
Preferred Stock

During January 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and
declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock. Each of these rights which are currently not exercisable will entitle the holder to purchase one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a
share of the Company’s newly designated Series E Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event that any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock or commences
or announces an intention to commence a tender offer that would result in such person or group owning 15% or more of the Company’s common stock, each holder of a right (other than the acquirer) will be entitled to receive, upon payment of the
exercise price, a number of shares of common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. In order to retain flexibility and the ability to maximize shareholder value in the event of transactions that may arise in
the future, the Board retains the power to redeem the rights for a set amount. The rights were distributed on January 25, 2002 and expire on January 10, 2012, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged or terminated in accordance with the Rights
Agreement.

16. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock Options

The Company has two equity participation plans (the 1999
Equity Participation Plan and the 2001 Equity Participation Plan) whereby options (both non-qualified and incentive stock options), stock appreciation rights and restricted stock may be granted to directors, employees and consultants. Upon adoption
of the 2001 Equity Participation Plan, no further grants are permitted under the 1999 Equity Participation Plan. The 2001 Equity Participation Plan provides for a maximum issuance of shares, together with all outstanding options and unvested shares
of restricted stock under all three of the plans, equal to 15% of the Company’s Class A common stock outstanding, adjusted for shares issued and the exercise of

F-41

certain options. These options generally vest between three to five years from the date of grant on a straight-line basis and generally have a seven-year or a ten-year life.

From time to time, restricted shares of Class A common stock or options to purchase Class A common stock have been granted under
the Company’s equity participation plans at prices below market value at the time of grant. The Company did not have any non-cash compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, relating to the
issuance of restricted shares or options to purchase Class A common stock.

The Company records compensation expense for
employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses a combination of historical data and implied
volatility to establish the expected volatility. Historical data is used to estimate the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the
estimated life of the option. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 1999, the Board of Directors of the
Company adopted the 1999 Stock Purchase Plan (the “1999 Purchase Plan”). A total of 500,000 shares of Class A common stock were reserved for purchase under the 1999 Purchase Plan. During 2003, an amendment to the 1999 Purchase Plan
was adopted which increased the number of shares reserved for purchase from 500,000 to 1,500,000 shares. In April 2009, the 1999 Plan expired and no shares were issued under the 1999 Plan during 2009. During 2008, the Company adopted the 2008
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2008 Purchase Plan”) which reserved 500,000 shares of Class A common stock for purchase. The 2008 Purchase Plan permits eligible employee participants to purchase Class A common stock at a price per
share which is equal to 85% of the fair market value of Class A common stock on the last day of an offering period.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the year ended December 31, 2009, 30,692 shares of Class A common stock

,

as a
result of the annual impairment evaluation, the Company recorded a $2.0 million impairment charge on 21 towers and related assets that are not expected to achieve previously anticipated lease-up results. The amount of impairment was determined by
using a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, the Company recorded a $1.9 million impairment charge on its six DAS networks based on the estimated fair value of the DAS networks. In 2008, as a result of the annual impairment evaluation, the
Company recorded a $0.9 million impairment charge on eight towers that had not achieved expected lease-up results as determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis.

18. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS, NET

Accumulated other
comprehensive loss, net has no impact on the Company’s net loss but is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet through adjustments to shareholders’ equity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net derives from the amortization of

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as management believes that it is not
“more likely than not” that the Company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to recognize the assets. The net change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $52.1
million and $(47.4) million, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2009 the Company recorded a valuation allowance relating to federal and state tax credit carryovers of approximately $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. These tax
credits expire beginning 2017.

The Company has available at December 31, 2009, a net federal operating tax loss
carry-forward of approximately $1.0 billion and an additional $97.3 million of net operating tax loss carry forward from stock options which will benefit additional paid-in capital when the loss is utilized. These net operating tax loss
carry-forwards will expire between 2019 and 2029. The Internal Revenue Code places limitations upon the future availability of net operating losses based upon changes in the equity of the Company. If these occur, the ability of the Company to offset
future income with existing net operating losses may be limited. In addition, the Company has available at December 31, 2009, a net state operating tax loss carry-forward of approximately $601.1 million. These net operating tax loss
carry-forwards will expire between 2010 and 2029.

Contingent Purchase Obligations

From
time to time, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration for acquisitions if the towers or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets in the one to three years after they have been acquired. As of
December 31, 2009, the Company has an obligation to pay up to an additional $11.5 million in consideration if the targets contained in various acquisition agreements are met. These obligations are associated with new build and tower acquisition
programs within the Company’s site leasing segment. On certain acquisitions, at the Company’s option, additional consideration may be paid in cash or shares of Class A common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
certain earnings targets associated with the acquired towers were achieved, and therefore, the Company paid in cash $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company issued approximately

21. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The Company has a defined contribution profit sharing plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code that provides for voluntary
employee contributions up to the limitations set forth in Section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees have the opportunity to participate following completion of three months of employment and must be 21 years of age. Employer
matching begins immediately upon the employee’s participation in the plan. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company made a discretionary matching contribution of 50% of an employee’s contributions up to a
maximum of $3,000. Company matching contributions were approximately $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.7 million for years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

22. PENSION PLANS

The Company had a defined benefit pension plan (the
“Pension Plan”) which was included in the acquisition of AAT Communications in 2006. The Pension Plan was for all employees of AAT Communications hired on or before January 1, 1996. AAT ceased all benefit accruals for active
participants on December 31, 1996. The Pension Plan provided for defined benefits based on the number of years of service and average salary.

During 2008, the Company began the process of terminating the Pension Plan. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service on
the termination of the Pension Plan. As a result of terminating the plan, the Company recorded a settlement expense of $0.6 million in connection with the projected final benefit settlement which is included in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, in 2008 due to the termination of the plan, the Company recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost all amounts in accumulated
other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has made all benefit payments related to the termination of the Pension Plan.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

24. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (unaudited)

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares for the period. Diluted net income per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive common shares
arising from the assumed exercise of stock options and convertible debt, if dilutive. The dilutive impact of potentially dilutive stock options is determined by applying the treasury stock method and the dilutive impact of the convertible debt is
determined by applying the “if converted” method. Potentially dilutive shares for the periods prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2008 and subsequent quarters have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as
their impact would have been anti-dilutive.

Because loss per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number
of common and dilutive common shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total loss per share amounts for the year.
