ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications tower structures, rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites.” Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition,

we own and operate towers in Canada, Central America, and

Brazil

. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed

96.3%

of our total segment operating profit for the year ended

December 31, 2014

. In our site leasing business, we (1) lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of

December 31, 2014

, we owned

24,292

towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. We also managed or leased approximately

5,000

actual or potential towers, approximately


of which were revenue producing as of

December 31, 2014

. Our other business line is our site development business, through

which

we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the United States, Canada, Central America, and Brazil.

Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Oi

S.A.

, Digicel,

Claro

, and Telefonica.

Wireless service providers enter into different tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower. Our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit, representing 96.


% or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years.

Increased expansion activity in international markets has resulted in our international site leasing revenues exceeding 10% of our total revenues.  As a result, commencing in the second quarter of 2014, we classified our site leasing business into two report

able

segments, domestic site leasing and international site leasing.

Domestic Site Leasing

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had

15,124

sites in the United States.  For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we generated

85.1%

of our

total

site leasing revenue from these sites.

Domestic site leasing revenues are received primarily from AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless,

and

T-Mobile.

In the United States, wireless service providers typically enter into tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower. Our tenant leases in the United States are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which typically average 3-4% per year.  Our ground leases in the United States are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of 5-year periods, at our option, and provide for rent escalators which typically average


-


% annually.

International Site Leasing

In


, we continued to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers. We believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a high-growth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments. As of

December 31, 2014

, we

owned

9,168

tower

s in our international markets,

including Brazil,

Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua,

and

Panama.

International site leasing revenues are received

primarily from Oi

S.A.

, Telefonica, Claro, Digicel, TIM, and

NII Holdings

. Our

operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business, and we expect to

continue to

expand operations through new builds and acquisitions.

Our tenant leases in Canada typically have similar terms and conditions as those in the United States with an initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant.  These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year.  Tenant leases in our Central America and Brazil markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5-year renewal periods.  In Central America, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the United States and Canada while our leases in Brazil typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index.  In Brazil, site leases are typically governed by master lease agreements, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site.



These site leases typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass-through charge for a portion of the underlying ground lease rent.  Our ground leases in Canada, Central America and Brazil generally have similar terms and conditions as those in the United States, except that the annual escalator in Brazil is based on a cost of living index.

Domestic and International Expansion

We expand our tower portfolio, both domestically and internationally, through the acquisition of towers from third parties and through the construction of new tower structures. In our tower acquisition program, we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns. For each acquisition, we prepare various analyses that include projections of a five-year unlevered internal rate of return, review of available capacity, future lease up projections, and a summary of current and future tenant/technology mix.

The majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the United States. Accordingly, our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by (i) wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks, (ii) consumers’ increased use of high data applications, such as email, internet access, mobile device applications, and video, and (iii) incremental spectrum auctions, which have resulted in new market entrants, as well as incremental voice and data network deployments.

Since we first entered Brazil in 2012, we

have built or

acquired 6,927 towers and continue to expand in that country to respond to a growing demand there.  Additionally

, since we first entered Costa Rica in 2010, spectrum auctions significantly increased demand for antenna space. Since we entered this market, we have built or

acquired 499 towers

to respond to that demand and plan to continue our expansion.

We consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion, including:

·

Country analysis – We consider the country’s political stability, and whether the country’s general business, legal and regulatory environment is conducive to the sustainability and growth of our business.

·

Market potential – We analyze the expected demand for wireless services, and whether a country has multiple wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks, as well as spectrum auctions that have occurred or that are anticipated to occur.

·

Risk adjusted return criteria – We consider whether buying or building towers in a country, and providing our management and leasing services, will meet our return criteria. As part of this analysis, we consider the risk of entering into an international market (for example, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates), and how our expansion meets our long-term strategic objectives for the region and our business generally.

In our new build program, we construct tower structures in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under build-to-suit arrangements. Under build-to-suit arrangements, we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified. We retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to co-locate additional tenants. When we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us, we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need, or will need, to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands. We seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete pre-construction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts. We generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants. During


, we intend to build between


5 and 595

new tower structures, domestically and internationally.

Site Development Services

Our site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our towers. Site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) site audits; (


) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (


)

modification of lease agreements to add equipment to existing structures; (4)

support in buying or leasing of the location; (5)

obtaining zoning approvals and permits;

(6) tower

structure

construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services

on a local basi

s

,

through regional, territory

,

and project offices. The regional offices are responsible for all site development operations, including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices, and a substantial portion of the sales in such area.



For financial information about our operating

segments, please see Note 20 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

Industry Developments

We believe that growing wireless traffic (particularly data and video), the deployment of additional spectrum, and technology advancements will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of towers that they use and an increase in the amount of equipment they deploy at existing towers. We expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends:

·

As wireless data usage grows rapidly, carriers are investing to increase the capacity of their networks; and we believe that the continued capacity increases will require our customers to add large numbers of additional cell sites and additional equipment at current cell sites.

·

We have seen, and anticipate there could be other, new entrants into the wireless communications industry that could deploy regional or national wireless networks for voice and data services.

·

Spectrum licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in 2006 and 2008 has enabled continued network development

. W

e expect this and the potential availability of additional spectrum through several

completed and

planned government auctions in


and beyond

to

drive

continued network development in the U.S.

·

Consumers are increasing their use of wireless data services due to expansion of wireless data applications, such as email, web browsing, mobile apps and games, social networking, music and video, and continued wireline to wireless migration. Wireless devices are trending toward more bandwidth intensive devices such as smartphones, laptops, netbooks, tablets and other emerging and embedded devices.

A

s a result, according to industry estimates,

global mobile data traffic

will grow at an

approximately 57% compound annual growth rate from 2014 to 2019.

·

Consumers list network quality as one of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when terminating or changing service. To decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth, wireless carriers have made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage.

For example, U.S. wireless carriers’ capital expenditures have increased from

an estimated $19.9 billion in 2009 to an estimated

$32.1

billion in 2014, and we expect capital expenditures in the fore

seeable future to remain elevated as wireless carriers continue to improve their networks.

We believe that the world-wide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably well-capitalized, highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services. Therefore, we expect that we will see a multi-year trend of strong additional demand for tower space from our customers, which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us.

Business Strategy

Our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins, and low customer churn. The long-term nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business, which is more cyclical. By focusing on our site leasing business, we believe that we can maintain a stable, recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending. Key elements of our strategy include:

Maximizing Use of Tower

Capacity

.

We generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures. Most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas, and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost. We actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force. As of

December 31, 2014

, we had an

average of

1.8

tenants per tower

structure

.

Disciplined Growth of our Tower Portfolio

.

We believe that our tower operations are highly scalable. Consequently, we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling, general, and administrative expenses. During


, we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally,

by

5-10

% through

tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures. In connection with our international expansion, we have targeted select international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communications industry. We intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity, including borrowings, to build and/or acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our long-term target leverage ratios.



Capitalizing on our Scale and Management Experience.

We are a large owner, operator and developer of towers, with substantial capital, human, and operating resources. We have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the U.S. since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997. We believe our size, experience, capabilities, and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the U.S. and internationally. Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development, with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries. Management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services.

Controlling our Underlying Land Positions

. We have purchased and/or entered into perpetual easements or long-term leases for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so, to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices. We believe that these purchases, perpetual easements, and/or long-

term leases will increase our margins, improve our cash flow from operations, and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future. As of

December 31, 2014

, approximately

73%

of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, was


years. As of

December 31, 2014

, approximately

5.0%

of our tower structures have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years.

Using our Local Presence to Build Strong Relationships with Major Wireless Service Providers.

Given the nature of towers as location-specific communications facilities, we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally. Consequently, we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience, expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships. We are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally. Due to our presence in local markets, we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets.

Customers

Since commencing operations, we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large U.S. wireless service providers. In both our site leasing and site development businesses, we work with large national providers and smaller regional, local, or private operators.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues. The following customers represented at least 10% of our total revenues during the last three years:

(


)

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of Sprint and Clearwire.

(2)

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of

AT&T Wireless and Leap Wireless (Cricket Wireless).

(3)

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of T-Mobile and Metro PCS.

During the past two years, we provided services or leased space to a number of customers, including:



Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing goals are to:

•

use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with respect to our owned or managed towers, enabling us to grow our site leasing business; and

•

successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins and/or provide a financial or strategic benefit to our site leasing business.

We approach sales on a company-wide basis, involving many of our employees. We have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team. Our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office. We also rely on our vice presidents, general managers, and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers. Our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers. Most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices. We believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters. Our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate. Our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentive-based goals and measurements.

Competition

Domestic Site Leasing

– In the U.S., our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are (1) the national independent tower companies including American Tower Corporation and Crown Castle International, (2) a large number of regional independent tower owners, (3) wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers, and (4) alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, billboards, and electric transmission towers. American Tower and Crown Castle have significantly more towers than we do, which could provide them a competitive advantage in negotiating with wireless service providers. Furthermore, these entities generally have greater financial resources than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage in connection with the acquisition of material tower portfolios. However, we believe that tower location and capacity have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. Other competitive factors are quality of service to our tenants and price.

International Site Leasing

– In Brazil, our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks, as well as large national and regional independent tower companies, while in the Central American and Canadian markets, our competition is principally from wireless service providers who lease towers to other wireless providers.

Site Development

– The site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive. We believe that the majority of our competitors in the U.S. site development business operate within local market areas exclusively, while some firms offer their services nationally. The market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site development consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors, which provide end-to-end site development services through multiple subcontractors, and wireless service providers’ internal staff. We believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria, including: company experience, price, track record, local reputation, geographic reach, and time for completion of a project.

Employees

Our executive, corporate development, accounting, finance, human resources, legal and regulatory, information technology and site administration personnel, and our network operations center, are located in our headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida. Certain sales, new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our Boca Raton office. Our remaining employees are based in our international, regional, and local offices.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had

1,259

employees of which


were based outside of the U.S. and its territories. We consider our employee relations to be good.



Regulatory and Environmental Matters

Federal Regulations.

In the U.S., which

accounted for

85.1%

of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended

December 31, 2014

, both the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration

(the “FAA”) regulate towers. Many FAA requirements are implemented in FCC regulations. These regulations, which were amended in 2014, govern the construction, lighting, and painting or other marking of towers, as well as the maintenance, inspection, and record keeping related to towers, and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed, altered or used. Wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used. In addition, any applicant for an FCC tower structure registration (through the FCC’s Antenna Structure Registration System) must certify that, consistent with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of Federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance. New tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site: compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”); compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”); compliance with the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”); and may require notification to the FAA.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the FCC, in conjunction with the FAA, has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers. These standards mandate that the FCC and the FAA consider the height of the proposed tower, the relationship of the tower to existing natural or man-made obstructions, and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. The FAA may condition its issuance of a no-hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting and/or painting requirements. Towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the FCC. A tower that requires FAA clearance will not be registered by the FCC until it is cleared by the FAA. Upon registration, the FCC may also require special lighting and/or painting. Owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with FAA and FCC regulations. Tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the FAA of any lighting outage or malfunction.

Owners and operators of towers may be subject to, and therefore must comply with, environmental laws, including NEPA, NHPA and ESA. Any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the NEPA, among other statutes, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances. The FCC has issued regulations implementing the NEPA. These regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower. In the event the FCC determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the FCC has developed, the FCC would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which will be subject to public comment. This process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower.

We generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction, modification, or placement of towers. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction, modification, and placement of towers. The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of radio communication towers. Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities. This may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities.

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination and related personal injury or property damage. We are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require pre-construction environmental studies. Operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency (“RF”) emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements. Certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to RF emissions. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can produce negative health effects. The potential connection between low-level RF energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws.



These costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

State and Local Regulations.

Most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition, leasing activities, and construction activities. Where required, we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents, who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors, and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors, who may be our employees or independent contractors. Local regulations include city and other local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations, or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers. In addition, many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations. Local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers, and have, in some instances, instituted moratoria.

International

. Regulatory regimes outside of the U.S. and its territories vary by country and locality; however, these regulations typically require tower owners and/or licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Additionally, some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting, lighting, and maintenance. Our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas. Based on our experience to date, these regimes have been similar to, but not more rigorous, burdensome or comprehensive than, those in the U.S. Non-compliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders. Our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters. As we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas, we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions.

Backlog

ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Business

If our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected.

Significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar. In connection with the combinations of Verizon Wireless and ALLTEL (to form Verizon Wireless), Cingular and AT&T Wireless (to form AT&T Mobility) and Sprint PCS and Nextel (to form Sprint), the combined companies have



rationalized and may continue to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks, which has led and may continue to lead to the non-renewal of certain leases on our towers. During 2013, Sprint acquired Clearwire Communications and T-Mobile acquired MetroPCS, and in 2014, AT&T acquired Leap Wireless (Cricket Wireless). This consolidation may also lead to non-renewal of certain of our tower leases. If our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of, among other factors, limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the U.S., this consolidation could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.

We have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.

As indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity (deficit). The following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ equity as of

December 31, 2014

and


.

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest, or other amounts due on our indebtedness. Subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may also incur

significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured debt. This may have the effect of increasing our total leverage. For example, on February 7, 2014, SBA Senior Finance II secured a new $1.5 billion senior secured Term Loan

;

on July 1, 2014, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes

;

and on October 15, 2014, we, through a New York common law trust, issued $1.54 billion aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities.

As a consequence of our indebtedness, (1) demands on our cash resources may increase, (2) we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (3) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. For example, as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the U.S. economy:

•

we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise, thereby reducing our cash flows;

•

we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best long-term interests;

•

we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments, including tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures;

•

we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;

•

we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and

•

we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations.

These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities.



In addition, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans, and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all. There is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenues.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. Consequently, a reduction in demand for site leasing, reduced future capital expenditures on the networks, or the loss, as a result of bankruptcy, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise, of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth.

The following is a list of significant customers (representing at least 10% of revenue in any of the last three years) and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers:

We also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments:

(


)

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of Sprint and Clearwire.

(2)

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of

AT&T Wireless and Leap Wireless (Cricket Wireless).

(3)

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of T-Mobile and Metro PCS.

Revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. Each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the U.S. and Canada, and renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. Site leasing contracts in our Central and Brazil markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5-year renewal periods. However, if any of our significant site leasing clients were to



experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. In addition, a customer’s need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. Furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects.

A slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues, and we cannot control that demand.

Additional revenue growth on our towers other than through contractual escalators comes directly from additional investment by our wireless service provider customers in their networks. If wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or data usage, or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications, our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services. Regardless of consumer demand, each wireless service customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks, including licenses for spectrum. In addition, our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing, roaming or resale arrangements. As a result of all of the above, wireless carriers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our international operations are subject to economic, political and other risks, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position.

Our current business operations in Canada, Central America and Brazil, and our expansion into any other international markets in the future, could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. The consolidated revenues generated by our international

operations were

13.3%

during the year ended

December 31, 2014

,

and

we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will

continue to

grow in the future. Accordingly, our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally

, including:

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;

•

laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital;

•

laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business, including zoning, maintenance and environmental matters, and laws related to ownership of real property;

•

laws and regulations governing our employee relations, including occupational health and safety matters;

•

changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers, which may be applied and enforced retroactively;

•

expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership;

•

restriction or revocation of spectrum licenses;

•

our ability to comply with, and the costs of compliance with, anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar local anti-bribery laws;

•

our ability to compete with owners and operators of wireless towers that have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have;

•

uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems, including inconsistencies between and within laws, regulations and decrees, and judicial application thereof, and delays in the judicial process;



•

health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic;

•

difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel; and

•

language and cultural differences.

Our international operations in Central America are primarily denominated in United States dollars, while our operations in Canada and Brazil are denominated in local currencies. The Brazilian Real has been subject to significant volatility, and the United States Dollar has strengthened significantly against the Brazilian Real and Canadian Dollar in the last 6 months. If this trend were to continue, it could adversely affect our reported results of operations. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts.

In addition, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Brazil Shareholder I, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and SBA Torres Brasil, Limitada, a limitada existing under the laws of the Republic of Brazil, entered into an intercompany loan agreement where from time to time the entities may agree to lend/borrow amounts up to $750.0 million. In accordance with ASC 830, we are required to re-measure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in Other Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Consequently, if the US

D

ollar strengthens against the Brazilian Rea

l

our results of operations would be adversely affected.

If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our real property interests relating to our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and other similar interests. From time to time, we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures, which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers. Further, landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators and our competitors, which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all. In addition, the land underlying the 2,113 towers we acquired from Oi

S.A., one of Brazil’s largest telecommunications providers

, in 2013 is subject to a concession from the

Federal Republic of Brazil tha

t expires in 2025.  At the end of the term, the Brazilian government would have the right to (i) renew the concession upon ne

wly negotiated terms or (ii) terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land

.  Although Oi S.A. has entered into a non-terminable lease with us for 35 years, if the concession was not renewed, our site leasing revenue from co-located tenants would terminate

. For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we generated

21.6%

o

f our total international site leasing revenue from these 2,113

towers

.

As

of

December 31, 2014

, the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, was approximately


years, and approximately

5.0%

of our tower structures hav

e

ground leases maturing in the next 10 years.  Failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our

communication site

portfolio long term.

W

e intend to grow our

tower

por

tfolio, domestically and internationally, through acquisitions and new builds and expect this growth to be between 5-10% during 2015. Our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements. Traditionally, our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies, independent tower developers and wireless service providers. However, as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these mid-sized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers. Increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, higher acquisition prices, and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers. Furthermore, to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us. As a result of these risks, the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to meet our long-term tower portfolio growth target. If we are not able to successfully address these challenges, we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the long-term.

We curren

tly intend to build 575 to 595

new towers, domestically

and internationally, during 2015

. However, our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits. Furthermore, with respect to our international new builds, our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions, inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets.



Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification.

Due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated, the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many

towers as we had planned in 2015

. If we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals.

New technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations.

The emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. For example, the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider (i.e. network sharing) could reduce the demand for our tower space. Additionally, the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as beam forming or “smart antenna,” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space. The development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video, voice and data services by satellites or other technologies, could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space. If any of these or other new technologies are widely adopted in the future it could have a material adverse effect on our growth and results of operations.

We may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire.

A key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions.  We rely on our due diligence of the towers and the representations and financial records of the sellers and other third parties to establish the anticipated revenues and expenses and whether the acquired towers will meet our internal guidelines for current and future potential returns. In addition, we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title, access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers.  This is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers. To the extent that these towers were acquired in individually material transactions, we may be required to place enhanced reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers. If (i) these records are not complete or accurate, (ii) we do not have complete access to, or use of, the land underlying the acquired towers or (iii) the towers do not achieve the financial results anticipated, it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.

In addition, acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy, such as (i) an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquired towers do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models, (ii) unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions that may impact our results of operations for a period, (iii) increased demands on our cash resources that may, among other things, impact our ability to explore other opportunities, (iv) undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover, (v) increased vulnerability to general economic conditions, (vi) an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships, (vii) additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory, political and economic risks if such acquisitions were in new jurisdictions and (viii) diversion of managerial attention.

We may not successfully integrate acquired towers into our operations.

As part of our growth strategy, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions. The process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. It may also result in the loss of key customers and/or personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities. These risks may be exacerbated in those circumstances in which we acquire a material number of towers. Further, we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire, and we may not be able to timely attract new skilled employees and management to replace them. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions into our existing business. This is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers.

Delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate.

There can be no assurances that 3G, 4G, including long-term evolution (“LTE”), or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. The deployment of 3G experienced

delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries, and deployment



of 4G could experience delays. Additionally

, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated, particularly in certain of our international markets. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.

We may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline.

If wireless service provider demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease, we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected. This may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations. Our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers.

Increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us.

Our industry is highly competitive, and our customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space. Some of our competitors, such as (1) U.S. and international wireless carriers that allow co-location on their towers and (2) large independent tower companies, have been, and based on recent consolidations continue to be, substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us. This could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers.

In the site leasing business, we compete with:

•

wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers;

•

national and regional tower companies; and

•

alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor DAS networks, billboards and electric transmission towers.

We believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. However, competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. In addition, we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. Increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly, or limit the acquisition opportunities altogether. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

The site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. There are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business. As a result of this competition, margins in this segment may come under pressure. Many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable. If margins in this segment were to decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected.

The documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility.

The indentures governing the 5.75% Notes, the 5.625% Notes and the 4.875% Notes, the Senior Credit Agreement, and the Secured Tower Revenue Securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. Among other things, the covenants under each indenture limit our ability to:

•

merge, consolidate or sell assets;

•

make restricted payments, including pay dividends or make other distributions;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;



•

enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and

•

issue guarantees of indebtedness.

We are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the Senior Credit Agreement. As amended in February 2014, the Senior Credit Agreement requires SBA Senior Finance II to maintain specific financial ratios, including, at the SBA Senior Finance II level, (1) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA not to exceed 6.5 times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net Hedge Exposure (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.5 times for 30 consecutive days and (3) a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter.

Additionally, the mortgage loan relating to our Tower Securities contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum debt service coverage ratio. To the extent that the debt service coverage ratio, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30 times or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30 times for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15 times as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter.

These covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. Further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisitions or other opportunities. If we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments. If any default occurs, all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the Senior Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable.

Our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.

Fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans or upon refinancing our fixed rate debt. As a result, we are exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. There is no guarantee that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. We currently have no interest rate swaps.

Our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business.

We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our only significant assets are, and are expected to be, the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. We conduct, and expect to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. Most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries, including the mortgage loan underlying the Tower Securities, the 5.75% Notes, the Term Loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal, if any, under their respective indebtedness. Other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding warrants related to our convertible notes, 5.625% Notes, and 4.875% Notes, we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments.



Our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations.

The demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of long-term results. Numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including:

•

the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures;

•

the size and scope of our projects;

•

the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’ fiscal year;

•

delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment;

•

seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter;

•

the use of third party providers by our customers;

•

the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development; and

•

general economic conditions.

Although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space, in anticipation of future contracts. In addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. Therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services.

We

have not been

profitable and

may

incur losses

in the future

.

Historically, we have

not

been

profitable. The following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated:

Our losses are principally due to depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, interest expense (including non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees), and losses from the extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above.

The loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our

business.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. We have employment agreements with Jeffrey A. Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kurt L. Bagwell, our Executive Vice President and President—International, Thomas P. Hunt, our Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, and Brendan T. Cavanagh, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. If we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.



Our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business.

We are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., both the FAA and the FCC regulate the construction, modification, and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts. In addition, the FCC separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers. FAA and FCC regulations govern construction, lighting, painting, and marking of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower, require registration of the tower. Certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the FAA to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation.

Tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to FAA and FCC regulations and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. Tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any lighting outages. Certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from towers are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes, including NEPA, NHPA and ESA. Failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. In addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth.

Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification. Local regulations can delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. In addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us. Furthermore, with respect to our international new builds, our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions, inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations.

Our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters.

Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. We maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. We also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. A tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.

To the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers, due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances, our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses; however, we would be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower, including ground lease expenses. If we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. As owner, lessee, or operator of numerous tower structures, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee, or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. However, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses.

We are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business. We also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses (“NOLs”) in U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. Generally, for U.S. federal and state tax purposes, NOLs can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years, and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our NOLs are used or expire. We expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority. We believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority. If there are tax benefits, including from our use of NOLs or other tax attributes, that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority, we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities, which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, we may be limited in our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes. We have substantial federal and state NOLs, including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as those generated through our historic business operations. In addition, we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities.

To the extent we believe that a position with respect to an NOL is not more likely than not to be sustained, we do not record the related deferred tax asset. In addition, for NOLs that meet the recognition threshold, we assess the recoverability of the NOL and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the NOL if recoverability is questionable. Given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our NOLs, we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our NOLs.

Our ability to utilize our NOLs is also dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our NOLs before they expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our NOLs, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance. We review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our NOLs periodically and make adjustments from time to time, which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our NOLs. Our NOLs are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the NOLs were incurred, and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our NOLs. If we are unable to use our NOLs or use of our NOLs is limited, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future.

The issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. We may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control, caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. Depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change, an ownership change under Section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income. Currently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized.

Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equity-related offerings.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, including sales by any selling shareholder, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.

Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from RF energy.

The U.S. government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to RF energy. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can cause negative health effects. The potential connection between exposure to low levels of RF energy and certain



negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. According to the FCC, the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive. However, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. Moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of RF energy and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. Our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on RF energy exposure. If we were subject to claims relating to exposure to RF energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

Our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law provide for anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our Class A common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

We are headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida where we currently lease approximately 103,000 square feet of office space in multiple buildings. These leases expire at different dates extending through February 28, 2022.

In addition, on November 1, 2013, we purchased a new headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida where we currently own approximately 160,000 square feet of office space.

We have entered into long-term leases for

international,

regional

,

and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longer-term. We open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business. We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate.

Our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests, leasehold interests created by long-term lease agreements, perpetual easements, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and other similar interests. For the year ended

December 31, 2014

,

approximately

73%

of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land that

have an interest that extends beyond 20 years. The average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, has been extended to


years. In rural areas, support for our towers, equipment shelters, and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10,000 square feet. Less than 2,500 square feet is required for a monopole or self-supporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers. Land leases generally have an initial term of five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years, for a total of thirty years or more.

MANAGEMENT’S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications tower structures, rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for

wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites.” Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in Canada, Central America, and

Brazil

. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed

96.3%

of our total segment operating profit for the year ended

December 31, 2014

. In our site leasing business, we (1) lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of

December 31, 2014

, we owned

24,292

towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. We also managed or leased approximately

5,000

actual or potential towers

, approximately


of which were revenue producing as of

December 31, 2014

. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service

providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the United States, Canada, Central America, and Brazil. Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Oi S.A., Digicel, Claro and Telefonica. Wireless service providers enter into different tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower. In the United States and Canada, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average

3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. Tenant leases in our Central

American

and

Brazilian

markets typically

have an initial term of 10 years with 5-year renewal periods. In Central America, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the United States and Canada while our leases in Brazil escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index.

Cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:

•

Rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests;

•

Straight-line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term (which may include renewal terms) of the underlying property interests;

•

Property taxes;

•

Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);

•

Utilities;

•

Property insurance; and

•

Deferred lease origination cost amortization.

Ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators

which typically average

2-3

% annually, or in Brazil adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index. As of

December 31, 2014

, approximately

73%

of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. For any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly

or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally



increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.

In our Central American markets, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, most of our ground leases, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are due and paid in U.S. dollars. In our Central American markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. In our Canadian and Brazilian operations, significantly all of our revenue, expenses and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other tower-related expenses, are denominated in local currency

.

As indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 20 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

We believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements

. During 2015, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to be consistent with our growth in 2014

. We believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue.

Site Development Services

Our site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others.

For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 20 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended

December 31, 2014

, included herein. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of



revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally five to ten years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, we recognize the revenue related to that phase. Site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts,” included within other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable.

Asset Impairment

We evaluate individual long-lived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed. We evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists. We evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present. We have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment.

We record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible.

If the future undiscounted cash

flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible,

we

calculate future discounted cash flows and compare those amounts to the carrying value.

We

record an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value. Estimates

and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential, and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge.

Business Combinations

We account for

business combinatio

ns under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities we acquire are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with our results of operations from the dates of the respective acquisitions. We continue to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date. The intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date (“Current contract



i

ntangibles”) and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the communication sites (“Network location intangibles”) and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows. The intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related communication site assets, which is typically 15 years.

In connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to pay contingent consideration (or earnouts) if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired. We accrue for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. All subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recorded through Consolidated Statements of Operations.

, a

decrease

of

$31.6

million compared to a loss of

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses:

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, salaries, benefits, non-cash compensation, and other expenses due in part to our continued portfolio expansion as well as costs incurred in connection with our international expansion.

Acquisition Related Adjustments and Expenses:

Acquisition related adjustments and expenses decreased $21.2 million for the year ended

December 31, 2013

Other Income (Expense):



Interest expense increased $52.8 million for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to

higher average principal amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended

December 31, 2013

compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from the issuance of the 2012-1 and 2012-2 Term Loans, 2012 Tower Securities, 2013 Tower Securities, 5.75% Notes, and 5.625% Notes. These increases were partially offset by the maturity of the 1.875% Notes, the full repayment of the 8.0% Senior Notes, as well as partial prepayments of the 2011 Term Loan, 2012-2 Term Loan, and 8.25% Senior Notes.

Non-cash interest expense decreased $21.0 million for the year ended

These increases were offset by the full redemption of the 8.0% Notes, the partial redemption of the 8.25% Notes, and the settlement of the 1.875% Notes.

Loss from extinguishment of debt decreased $45.7 million for the year ended

December 31, 2013

,

as

compared to the prior year, primarily due to the premium paid on the 8.0% and 8.25% Senior Notes during the second and third quarters of 2012 and the write off of the related debt discount and deferred financing fees as compared to the write off of debt discounts and deferred financing fees associated with the partial repayment of the 2011 and 2012-2 Term Loans in 2013.

Other income increased $25.5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, as compared to the prior year,

primarily due to a $27.3 million gain on the sale of a bankruptcy claim against Lehman Brothers in the third quarter of 2013, as compared to a $4.6 million gain on partial settlement of a bankruptcy claim received during the year ended December 31, 2012.

Net Loss:

Net loss decreased $125.


million for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, as

compared to the prior year, primarily due to a

n increase in our total segment

operating profit, an increase in other income, and decreases in acquisition related expenses, loss from extinguishment of debt, and non-cash interest expense as compared to the prior year.

N

ON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This report contains

information regarding

a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA. We have provided below a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes th

is

measure.

Adjusted EBITDA

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition related

adjustments and

expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs,

interest income,

interest expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, provision for

or benefit from

taxes, and income from discontinued operations.

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an indicator of the financial performance of our core businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to our 5.625% Notes, 5.75% Notes, and 4.875% Notes. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Interest expense includes interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and amortization of deferred financing fees.

(2)

Provision for taxes includes

Adjusted EBITDA was

$998.8

million for the year ended

December 31, 2014

as compared to

$797.2

million for the year ended

December 31, 2013

. The

increase

of

$201.6

million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our domestic site leasing, international site leasing, and site development segments offset partially by the increase in our cash selling, general, and administrative expenses.

The increase in Adjusted EBITDA includes the negative impact of $1.4 million from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA was $797.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $587.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase of $209.


million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our domestic site leasing, international site leasing, and site development segments offset partially by the increase in our cash selling, general, and administrative expenses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SBA Communications Corporation (“SBAC”) is a holding company with no business operations of its own. SBAC’s only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, LLC (“Telecommunications”), which is also a holding company that owns equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly own all of our domestic and international towers and assets. We conduct all of our business operations through Telecommunications’ subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, other than financings, is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries.



A summary of our cash flows is as follows:

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities

was

$671.6

million

for the

year

ended

December 31, 2014

as compared to

$497.6

million for the

year

ended

December 31, 2013

. This increase was primarily due to an increase in segment operating profit from

domestic

site leasing

, international site leasing,

and site development operating segments

,

partially offset by increased selling, general, and administrative expenses, increased cash interest payments relating to the higher average amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding for the

year

ended

December 31, 2014

compared to the

year

ended

December 31, 2013

.

Investing Activities

A detail of our cash capital expenditures is as follows:

(1)

Included in our cash capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2013 is $175.9 million related to our acquisition of 800 towers from Vivo in the fourth quarter of 2012.

(2)

Excludes

$10.8

million,

$9.1

million, and

$9.7

million spent to extend ground lease terms for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


, respectively.

Subsequent to

December 31, 2014

, we acquired


towers and related assets for

$35.7

million in cash.

During fiscal year


, we expect to incur non-discretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general

corporate expenditures of

$30.0

million to

$40.0

million and discretionary cash capital expenditures, based on current

acquisition

obligations

, planned new tower construction, forecasted tower augmentations, and forecasted ground lease purchases,

of

$509.0

million to

$529.0

million as well as

potential

, additional tower acquisitions

not yet under contract

. We expect to fund these cash capital expenditures from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or new financings. The exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our

tower

portfolio, our new tower build and acquisition programs, and our ground lease purchase program.



Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 2014, our subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, obtained a new senior secured term loan with an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (the “2014 Term Loan”). Net proceeds from the 2014 Term Loan were used to (1) repay in full the remaining $180.5 million balance of the 2011 Term Loan, (2) repay in full the remaining $110.0 million balance of the 2012-2 Term Loan, (3) repay the $390.0 million outstanding balance under our Revolving Credit Facility, and (4) pay the cash consideration in connection with the Oi S.A. acquisition which closed on March 31, 2014. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, holders of the 4.0% Notes converted $499.9 million in principal which was settled for $499.7 million in cash and 11.7 million shares of our Class A common stock. Concurrently with the settlement of our conversion obligation, we settled the convertible note hedges receiving 11.7 million shares of our Class A common stock. As a result, our outstanding share count was not impacted by the conversion of these notes.  The remaining $38,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.0% Notes that was not converted matured on October 1, 2014 and was settled in cash at principal plus accrued interest.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid $885.0 million to early settle approximately 87% of the original warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the 4.0% Notes, representing approximately 14.4 million underlying shares of Class A common stock, originally scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2015. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we settled additional outstanding warrants for

$82.7

million, representing approximately 1.2 million underlying shares. As of

March 2, 2015

, we have approximately 5% of the original warrants still outstanding representing approximately

0.9

million underlying shares, which mature

over the balance of the first quarter of 2015

and will be settled by April 2, 2015.

On July 1, 2014, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “4.875% Notes”). Net proceeds from the 4.875% Notes were used to (i) redeem all of the 8.25% Notes due 2019 including the associated call premium for $253.0 million and (ii) pay the conversion obligations with respect to approximately $121.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.0% Notes. All remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

On October 15, 2014, we, through our existing SBA Tower Trust, issued $920.0 million of 2.898% Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-1C and $620.0 million of 3.869% Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-2C (collectively the “2014 Tower Securities”). Net proceeds from this offering were used to prepay in full $680

.0

million of 2010-1

Tower S

ecurities and to repay the $300

.0

million outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility which had been drawn in order to partially repay the 4.0% Notes due October 1, 2014. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we borrowed

$700.0

million and repaid

$790.0

million under the Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in an outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility at year-end of

$125.0

million. As of

December 31, 2014

, the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was

$645.0

million, subject to compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing.

As discussed further below under the Senior Credit Agreement, we entered into an amendment on February 5, 2015

to, among other things, increase the availability under our Revolving Credit Facility from $770.0 million to $1.0 billion

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we did not repurchase any shares of our Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of

December 31, 2014

, we had a remaining authorization to repurchase

$150.0

million of Class A common stock under our current $300.0 million stock repurchase program.

Registration Statements

We have on file with the Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 registering shares of Class A common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or antenna sites and related assets or companies who own wireless communication towers, antenna sites, or related assets. During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we did not issue any shares of Class A common stock under this registration statement. As of

December 31, 2014

, we had approximately 1.7 million shares of Class A common stock remaining under this shelf registration statement.

On February 27, 2012, we filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers on Form S-3ASR. This registration statement enables us to issue shares of our Class A common stock, preferred stock or debt securities either separately or represented by warrants, or depositary shares as well as units that include any of these securities. Under the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements, we will file a prospectus supplement and advise the Commission of the amount and type of securities each time we issue securities under this registration statement. For the year ended December 31, 2012,



we issued 6,005,000 shares of our Class A common stock under the automatic shelf registration statement and the prospectus supplement related thereto. No shares were issued in 2013 or 2014.

Debt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements

Senior Credit Agreement

On February 7, 2014, SBA Senior Finance II entered into a Second Amended a

nd Restated Credit Agreement

with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to

the Second

Amended a

nd Restated Credit Agreement

to, among other things,

incur the 2014 Term Loan and

amend

certain terms of the existing senior credit a

greement

(as amended, the “Senior Credit Agreement”)

.

Terms of the Senior Credit Agreement

The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, requires SBA Senior Finance II to maintain specific financial ratios, including (1) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA not to exceed 6.5 times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net Hedge Exposure (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.5 times for 30 consecutive days and (3) a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter. The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of SBA Senior Finance II and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into

transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of their property. As of

December 31, 2014

, SBA Senior Finance II was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit Agreement. The Senior Credit Agreement is also subject to customary events of default. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement

, amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loans and certain hedging transactions that may be entered into by SBA Senior Finance II or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the membership interests of SBA Telecommunications, LLC, SBA Senior Finance, LLC and SBA Senior Finance II and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real property) of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary Guarantors.

The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, permits SBA Senior Finance II, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide SBA Senior Finance II with increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans provided that after giving effect to the proposed increase in Revolving Credit Facility commitments or incremental term loans the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA would not exceed 6.5 times. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans is subject to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and, with respect to any additional term loan, an increase in the margin on existing term loans to the extent required by the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon SBA Senior Finance II’s request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Facility commitment or whether to provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms.

Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement

On February 5, 2015, SBA Senior Finance II entered into the 2015 Revolving

Refinancing Amendment with

several banks and other financial institutions or entities from

time to time parties to

the Senior Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the availability under our Revolving Credit Facility from $770.0 million to $1.0 billion, (ii) extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to February 5, 2020, (iii) provide for the ability to borrow in U.S. dollars and certain designated foreign currencies, and (iv) lower the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility.

As amended, the Revolving Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with specific financial ratios and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing.  Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin that ranges from 137.5 basis points to 200.0 basis points or (ii) the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 37.5 basis points to 100.0 basis points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA, calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement.  In addition, SBA Senior Finance II is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum on the amount of unused commitment.  If not earlier terminated by SBA Senior Finance II, the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on, and SBA Senior Finance II will repay all amounts outstanding on or



before, February 5, 2020.  The proceeds available under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.  SBA Senior Finance II may, from time to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of a period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we borrowed

$700.0

million and repaid

$790.0

Secured Tower Revenue Securities

Tower Revenue Securities Terms

The mortgage loan underlying the 2010 Tower Securities, 2012 Tower Securities, 2013 Tower Securities, and 2014 Tower Securities (together the “Tower Securities”) will be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate

9,659

tower sites owned by the Borrowers. The mortgage loan is secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust, and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower sites, (ii) a security interest in the tower sites and substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (iii) the Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases, and (iv) all of the proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar month, SBA Network Management, Inc., an indirect subsidiary, is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 4.5% of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.

The Borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (i) within nine months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2010 Tower Securities), twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2012 Tower Securities,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1D, and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-1C

), or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

2013-2C and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-2C) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component, (ii) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower owned by the Borrowers or (iii) during an amortization period. In all other circumstances, the Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. The prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the Tower Securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid, calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement, on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date within nine months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2010 Tower Securities), twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2012 Tower Securities,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1C,

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2013-1D, and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-1C

), or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the

Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series

2013-2C and Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2014-2C) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment.

To the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (i) 5% and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.

Pursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the towers owned by the Borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are held by the indenture trustee. The monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 4). However, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. In addition, if either the 2010-2 Tower Securities, 2012 Tower Securities, 2013 Tower Securities, or the 2014 Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the towers owned by the Borrowers will be trapped by the trustee



for the Tower Securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the Tower Securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those towers, third to pay the management fees due to SBA Network Management, Inc., fourth to repay principal of the Tower Securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above. The mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Borrowers met the required Debt Service Coverage Ratio as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants.

million outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility which had been drawn in order to partially repay the 4.0% Notes. The remaining net proceeds

were

used for general corporate purposes. We have incurred deferred financing fees in the aggregate of

$21.8

million in relation to this transaction which are being amortized through the anticipated repayment date of each of the 2014 Tower Securities.

In connection with the issuance of the 2014 Tower Securities, SBA Properties, LLC, SBA Sites, LLC, SBA Structures, LLC, SBA Infrastructure, LLC, SBA Monarch Towers III, LLC, SBA 2012 TC Assets PR, LLC, SBA 2012 TC Assets, LLC, SBA Towers IV, LLC, SBA Monarch Towers I, LLC, SBA Towers USVI, Inc., SBA Towers VII, LLC and SBA GC Towers, LLC (collectively, the “Borrowers”), each an indirect subsidiary of SBAC, and Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association, as

4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014

On April 24, 2009, we issued $500.0 million of 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes (“4.0% Notes”) in a private placement transaction. Interest was payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1.

The 4.0% Notes were convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of our Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 32.9164 shares of our Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 4.0% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $30.38 per share or a 22.5% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $24.80 per share of our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on April 20, 2009, the purchase agreement date.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 4.0% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible notes. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to the 4.0% Notes is $30.38 per share of our Class A common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 4.0% Notes) and the upper strike price of the warrant transactions is $44.64 per share.

Effective March 17, 2014, we elected to settle the principal amount of any conversions in cash and any additional conversion consideration at the conversion rate then applicable in shares of our Class A common stock. Concurrently with the settlement of any 4.0% Notes converted, we settled the associated convertible note hedges and received an equal number of shares to those issued to the noteholders.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, holders of the 4.0% Notes converted $499.9 million in principal which was settled for $499.7 million in cash and 11.7 million shares of our Class A common stock. Concurrently with the settlement of our conversion obligation, we settled the convertible note hedges receiving 11.7 million shares of our Class A common stock. As a result, our outstanding share count was not impacted by the conversion of these notes.  The remaining $38,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.0% Notes that was not converted matured on October 1, 2014 and was settled in cash at principal plus accrued interest.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid $885.0 million to early settle approximately 87% of the original warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the 4.0% Notes, representing approximately 14.4 million underlying shares of Class A common stock, originally scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2015. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we settled additional outstanding warrants for

$82.7

million, representing approximately 1.2 million underlying shares. As of

March 2, 2015

, we have approximately 5% of the original warrants still outstanding representing approximately

0.9

million underlying shares, which will mature

over the balance of the first quarter of 2015

and be settled by April 2, 2015.

The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.



The 5.75% Notes are subject to redemption in whole or in part on or after July 15, 2016 at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to July 15, 2015, Telecommunications may at its option redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Notes originally issued at a redemption price of 105.75% of the principal amount of the 5.75% Notes to be redeemed on the redemption date plus accrued and unpaid interest with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. If redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on July 15, 2016, July 15, 2017, or July 15, 2018 through maturity, the redemption price will be 102.875%, 101.438%, and 100.000%, respectively, of the principal amount of the 5.75% Notes to be redeemed on the redemption date plus accrued and unpaid interest.

million in relation to this transaction which are being amortized through the maturity date. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.625% Notes to pay a portion of the cash consideration in the TowerCo II Holdings LLC acquisition.

The 5.625% Notes are subject to redemption in whole or in part on or after October 1, 2016 at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to October 1, 2015, the Company may at its option redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.625% Notes originally issued at a redemption price of 105.625% of the principal amount of the 5.625% Notes to be redeemed on the redemption date plus accrued and unpaid interest with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings.

All remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

In connection with the issuance of the 4.

875% Notes, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representative of the Initial Purchasers. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to file and have declared effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the 4.875% Notes for new notes registered under the Securities Act, and complete the exchange offer on or prior to June 26, 2015. If we fail to consummate the exchange by this date, we will be obligated to pay additional interest of 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period and an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period thereafter, until our registration obligations are fulfilled, up to a maximum of 1.00% per annum.

Indentures Governing Senio

r Notes

The Indenture

s

governing the

Senior

Notes contain customary covenants, subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications, including restrictions on

the

ability

of SBAC and Telecommunications

to (1) incur additional indebtedness unless

the

Consolidated



Indebtedness to Annualized Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Indenture), pro forma for the additional indebtedness does not exceed

, with respect to any fiscal quarter,

9.5x for

SBAC and 7.5x for Telecommunications

, (2) merge, consolidate or sell assets, (3) make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions, (4) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (5) enter into sale and leaseback transactions and restrictions on the ability of the Restricted Subsidiaries

of SBAC and Telecommunications

(as defined in the Indenture

s

) to incur liens securing indebtedness.

BNDES Loans

During 2013

, we

assumed several loans valued at $5.0 million as part of an acquisition in Brazil (the “BNDES Loans”).

In April 2014, we repaid in full the $6.3 million outstanding balance of the BNDES Loans. The BNDES Loans had interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 6.5%.

Debt Service

As of

December 31, 2014

, we believe that our cash on hand, capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility

,

and our cash flows from operat

ions for the next twelve months

will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months.

The following table illustrates

our estimate of our debt service requirement over the next twelve months based on the amounts outstanding as of

December 31, 2014

and the interest rates accruing on those amounts on such date (in thousands):

(1)

Prior to February 5, 2015, the

Revolving Credit Agreement require

d

SBA Senior Finance II to pay a commitment fee of 0.


%

to 0.5%, depending on Borrower leverage,

per annum on the amount of unused commitment.

As amended February 5, 2015, the Revolving

Credit Agreement

reduced the c

ommitment fee

to

0.25% per annum

on the amount of unused commitment

.

Furthermore, the amended Revolving Credit Agreement reduced the interest rate on borrowings between 0.375% and 0.5% depending on Borrower leverage. The amount above does not factor in the reduced commitment fee or interest rate.

(2)

Total debt service excludes amounts necessary to settle the remaining 2.1 million warrants as of

December 31, 2014

scheduled to settle

during the first and second quarters of 2015

.

Inflation

The impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. However, we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation other than our contracts in Brazil which have inflationary index based rental escalators.



Commitments and Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business.

The following table presents the future principal payment obligations and fair values associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of

December 31, 2014

:

(1)

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2010-2 Tower Securities is April 17, 2017 and April 15, 2042, respectively.

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2012 Tower Securities is December 15, 2017 and December 15, 2042, respectively.

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2013-1C Tower Securities is April 17, 2018 and April 17, 2043, respectively.

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2013-2C Tower Securities is April 17, 2023 and April 17, 2048, respectively.

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2013-1D Tower Securities is April 17, 2018 and April 17, 2043, respectively.

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2014-1C Tower Securities is October 15, 2019 and October 17, 2044, respectively.

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2014-2C Tower Securities is October 15, 2024 and October 15, 2049, respectively.

(2)

On February 5, 2015, the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility was extended to February 5, 2020.

Our current primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk relating to (1) our ability to refinance our debt at commercially reasonable rates, if at all, (2) interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements on our 2012-1 Term Loan and 2014 Term Loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our Revolving Credit Facility, which are at floating rates. We manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt. While we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial



position on an ongoing basis. In addition, in connection with our remaining outstanding warrants sold in connection with our convertible notes, we are subject to market risk associated with the market price of our common stock.

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. In each of these countries, we pay most of our selling, general, and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses, such as taxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency. In addition, in Brazil and Canada, we receive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our operating expenses in local currency. All transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative

translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, approximately 9.8% of our revenues and approximately 11.1% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies

.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the Brazilian Rea

l

from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at

December 31, 2014

. As of

December 31, 2014

, the

analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our revenues and operating results to fluctuate by less than 1% for the year ended

December 31, 2014

.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This annual report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Specifically, this annual report contains forward-looking statements regarding:

•

our expectations on the future growth and financial health of the wireless industry and the industry participants, and the drivers of such growth;

•

our beliefs regarding our ability to capture and capitalize on industry growth and the impact of such growth on our financial and operational results;

•

our expectations regarding the opportunities in the international wireless markets in which we currently operate or have targeted for growth, our beliefs regarding how we can capitalize on such opportunities, and our intent to continue expanding internationally through new builds and acquisitions;

•

our

expectation that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements and the rate of such growth, on an organic basis, in our dome

stic and international segments

;

•

our belief that our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs, and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures;

•

our expectation that, due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, future expenditures required to maintain these towers will be minimal;

•

our expectation that we will grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs and executing monetary amendments;

•

CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures –

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of

December 31, 2014

, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of

December 31, 2014

, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended

December 31, 2014

that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting –

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of SBAC; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of SBAC are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of SBAC; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of SBAC’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of SBAC’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

based upon criteria in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management determined that SBAC’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2014

based on the criteria in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013 Framework) issued by COSO.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered certified public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on SBAC’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries

We have audited SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizatio

ns of the Treadway Commission (2013

framework) (the COSO criteria).

SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,

SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2014

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’

equity

(deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2014

of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries and our report dated

March 2, 2015

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

OTHER INFORMATION

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

(e)

On October 30, 2014, we entered into an employment agreement with Jeffrey A. Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer. The agreement replaces his existing employment agreement entered into with him on July 1, 2011, which would have expired on December 31, 2014. The new employment agreement provides for Mr. Stoops to serve in his present position and expires on December 31, 2017.

Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Stoops will receive an annual base salary of $700,000, which may be increased by the Board of Directors. In addition, Mr. Stoops will receive an annual bonus based on achievement of performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Mr. Stoops is eligible to receive a target bonus of 125% of base salary for 2014, and in subsequent years, the Compensation Committee will set Mr. Stoops’ target bonus, which may be greater or less than 125% of Mr. Stoops’ base salary for that year.

The employment agreement provides that upon termination of Mr. Stoops’ employment without cause, or Mr. Stoops’ resignation for good reason, Mr. Stoops is entitled to receive (i) an amount equal to the Applicable Multiple (as defined below) times the sum of his: (a) base salary for the year in which the termination or resignation occurs, (b) Reference Bonus (as defined below) and (c) Reference Benefits Value (as defined below), and (ii) a pro rata portion of the bonus for the year in which the termination or resignation occurs. The severance payments will be paid in a lump sum on the first business day of the third calendar month following the calendar month in which the termination or resignation is effective.

The Applicable Multiple means two, in the event the termination occurs prior to a change in control, and three, in the event the termination occurs on or after a change in control. Reference Benefits Value means the greater of (1) $33,560 and (2) the value of all medical, dental, health, life, and other fringe benefit plans for the year in which the termination or resignation occurs. Reference Bonus means the greater of (i) 75% of Mr. Stoops’ target bonus for the year in which the termination or resignation occurs and (ii) 100% of the bonus for the year immediately preceding the year in which the termination or resignation occurred.

Upon a change in control, the agreement is automatically extended for three years. The employment agreement provides for noncompetition, noninterference, non-disparagement and nondisclosure covenants. Mr. Stoops’ severance payment is subject to his execution of a full release and waiver of claims against us.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as follows:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the Company and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made by management relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the costs and revenue relating to the Company’s construction contracts, stock-based compensation assumptions, valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, fair value of long-lived assets, the useful lives of towers and intangible assets, anticipated property tax assessments, fair value of investments and asset retirement obligations. Management develops estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available. These estimates ultimately may differ from actual results and such differences could be material.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash in banks, money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

F-



Investments

Investment securities with original maturities of more than three months but less than one year at time of purchase are considered short-term investments. The Company’s short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of less than a year. Investment securities with maturities of more than a year are considered long-term investments and are classified in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Long-term investments primarily consist of U.S. Treasuries, mutual funds, and preferred securities. Gross purchases and sales of the Company’s investments are presented within “Cash flows from investing activities” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company accounts for its investments in privately held companies under the cost m

ethod

as it does not exert significant influence

. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company sold an investment with a carrying value of

$8.4

million f

or

$20.9

million

which is reflected in Net cash used in investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and

recorded a gain of

$12.5

million which is

reflected

in Other

income, net

in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The aggregate carrying value of the Company’s cost-method investments was

approximately

$43.3

million

and $51.7 million as of

December 31, 2014

and 2013, respectively, and is classified within other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The Company evaluates its cost-method investments for impairment at least annually. The Company determines the fair value of its cost-method investments by considering available evidence, including general market conditions, the investee’s financial condition, near-term prospects, market comparables and subsequent rounds of financing. The Company measures and records its cost-method investments at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company did

not

recognize any impairment loss associated with its cost-method investments during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.

Restricted Cash

The Company classifies all cash pledged as collateral to secure certain obligations and all cash whose use is limited as restricted cash. This includes cash held in escrow to fund certain reserve accounts relating to the Tower Securities as well as for payment and performance bonds and surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company in the ordinary course of business (see Note 4).

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost or at estimated fair value (in the case of acquired properties), adjusted for asset impairment and estimated asset retirement obligations. Costs for self-constructed towers include direct materials and labor, indirect costs and capitalized interest. Approximately

$0.3

million,

$0.1

million, and

$0.3

million of interest cost was capitalized in


,


and


, respectively.

Depreciation on towers and related components is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, not to exceed the minimum lease term of the underlying ground lease. The Company defines the minimum lease term as the shorter of the period from lease inception through the end of the term of all tenant lease obligations in existence at ground lease inception, including renewal periods, or the ground lease term, including renewal periods. If no tenant lease obligation exists at the date of ground lease inception, the initial term of the ground lease is considered the minimum lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the minimum lease term of the lease. For all other property and equipment, depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.

The Company performs ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset. If the useful lives of assets are reduced, depreciation may be accelerated in future years. Property and equipment under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or the remaining estimated life of the leased property, whichever is shorter, and the related amortization is included in depreciation expense. Expenditures for maintenance and repair are expensed as incurred.

Asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows:

F-



Betterments, improvements, and significant repairs, which increase the value or extend the life of an asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset. Changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively, with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life. There has been no material impact for changes in estimated useful lives for any years presented.

Deferred Financing Fees

Financing fees related to the issuance of debt have been deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the expected duration of the related indebtedness (see Note 13).

Deferred Lease Costs

The Company defers certain initial direct costs associated with the origination of tenant leases and lease amendments and amortizes these

costs over the initial lease term or over the lease term remaining if related to a lease amendment. Such deferred costs were approximately

$12.4

million,

$12.8

million, and

$10.2

million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Amortization expense was

$6.8

million,

$5.5

million, and

$4.6

million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is included in cost of site leasing on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, unamortized deferred lease costs were

$28.5

million and

$22.9

million

, respectively, and are included in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Intangible Assets

The Company classifies as intangible assets the fair value of current leases in place at the acquisition date of towers and related assets (referred to as the “Current contract intangibles”), and the fair value of future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the acquired towers (referred to as the “Network location intangibles”). These intangibles are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related tower assets, which is

typically


years.

For all intangible assets, amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as the benefit associated with these intangible assets is anticipated to be derived evenly over the life of the asset.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates its individual long-lived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed. The Company evaluates its tower assets and Current contract intangibles at the tower level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists. The Company evaluates its Network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present. The Company has established a policy to at least annually evaluate its tower assets and Current contract intangibles for impairment.

The Company records an impairment charge when the Company believes an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible.

If the future undiscounted cash

flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible, the Company calculates future discounted cash flows and compares those amounts to the carrying value. The Company records an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value.

Estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, the Company makes certain assumptions in determining

an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment

charge. The Company recorded asset

impairment

and decommission costs o

f

$23.8

million,

$29.0

million, and

$6.4

million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively,

which includes the write off of

$16.8

million

and $23.1 million

in carrying value of decommissioned

communication site

s and the incurrence of other third party decommission costs

, related to its long-lived assets and intangibles for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and 2013, respectively.  There were

no

write offs for decommissioned

towers

or the incurrence of other third party decommission costs, related to its long-lived assets and intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2012

.

F-



Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair market values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally

five

to

ten

years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Site development projects in which the Company performs consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which the Company performs work on a fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, the Company recognizes the revenue related to that phase. Site development projects generally take from


to


months to complete. Amounts billed in advance (collected or uncollected) are recorded as deferred revenue on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts,” included within other current liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers. The Company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable.

F-



The following is a rollforward of the

allowance for doubtful accounts:

Cost of Revenue

Cost of site leasing revenue includes ground lease rent, property taxes, amortization of deferred lease costs, maintenance and other tower operating expenses. All ground lease rental obligations due to be paid out over the lease term, including fixed escalations, are recorded on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. Liabilities recorded related to the straight-lining of ground leases are reflected in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of site development revenue includes the cost of materials, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects. All costs related to site development projects are recognized as incurred.

Income Taxes

The Company had taxable income for the year

ended

December 31, 2014

and utilized net operating loss carry

-

forwards.

For the years ended December 31,


and


, the Company had taxable losses and generated net operating loss carry-forwards. The majority of these net operating loss carry-forwards are fully reserved as management believes it is not “more-likely-than-not” that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to recognize the losses.

The U.S. tax losses generated in tax years 1999 through 2013 remain subject to adjustment and tax years 2011 through 2013 are open to examination by the major jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

The Company determines whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position taken in an income tax return will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The Company has not identified any tax exposures that require a reserve. In the future, to the extent that the Company records unrecognized tax exposures, any related interest and penalties will be recognized as interest expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company does not calculate U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. The Company records compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for stock options and restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense for employee stock options is based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Any stock options granted to non-employees would be valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the market price of the underlying common stock on the “valuation date,” which for options to non-employees is the vesting date. Expense related to options granted to non-employees would be recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period. Compensation expense for restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of the units awarded at the date of the grant.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company has entered into ground leases for the land underlying the majority of the Company’s towers. A majority of these leases require the Company to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of the ground lease.

F-



The Company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and accretes such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets, and over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the tower.

The asset retirement obligation at

December 31, 2014

and 2013

was

$5.9

million and

$5.3

million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon settlement of the obligations

, any difference between the cost to retire an asset and the recorded liability is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain or loss. In determining the measurement of the asset retirement obligations, the Company considered the nature and scope of the contractual restoration obligations contained in the Company’s third party ground leases, the historical retirement experience as an indicator of future restoration probabilities, intent in renewing existing ground leases through lease termination dates, current and future value and timing of estimated restoration costs and the credit adjusted risk-free rate used to discount future obligations.

The following summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation liability:

Loss Per Share

The Company has potential common stock equivalents related to its outstanding stock options and convertible senior notes. These potential common stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive in calculating the full year earnings per share. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share and the weighted average number of shares used in the computations are the same for all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, and is comprised of net income (loss) and other foreign currency adjustments.

Foreign Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that do not utilize the United States dollar as its functional currency are translated at period-end rates of exchange, while revenues and expenses are translated at monthly weighted average rates of exchange for the year. Unrealized translation gains and losses are reported as foreign currency translation adjustments through accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. The Company continues to evaluate all acquisitions

F-



for a period not to exceed

one

year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date. The intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date (“Current contract intangibles”) and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the towers (“Network location intangibles”) and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows. The intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related tower assets, which is typically 15 years.

In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company may agree to pay additional consideration (or earnouts) in cash or stock in certain acquisitions if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired. The Company accrues for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. All subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recorded through Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Intercompany Loans

On November 25, 2014, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, Brazil Shareholder I, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and SBA Torres Brasil, Limitada, a limitada existing under the laws of the Republic of Brazil, entered into an intercompany loan agreement where from time to time the entities may agree to lend/borrow amounts up to

$750.0

million. On November 25, 2014,

$455.8

million was borrowed under this agreement.

In accordance with ASC 830, the Company remeasures foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded a

$23.0

million foreign exchange loss on the remeasurement of intercompany loans.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released updated guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, exclusive of those contracts within lease accounting. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contracts with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the contract price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017. This guidance is required to be applied (1) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (2) with the cumulative effect being recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is evaluating the guidance including the impact on its consolidated financial statements

.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

— The Company’s earnouts related to acquisitions are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs. Level 3 valuations rely on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The Company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and any subsequent changes in fair value, using a discounted probability-weighted approach using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the earnouts is reviewed quarterly and is based on the payments the Company expects to make based on historical internal observations related to the anticipated performance of the underlying assets. The

Company’s estimate of the fair value of its obligation if the performance targets contained in various acquisition agreements were met was

$15.1

million and

$30.1

million as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively, which the Company recorded in accrued expenses

on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in estimate are recorded in acquisition related adjustments and expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. The maximum potential obligation related to the performance targets was

$23.1

million and

$42.1

million as of

December 31, 2014

and 2013, respectively.

F-



The following summarizes the activity of the accrued earnouts:

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

— The Company’s acquired long-lived assets, intangibles, and asset retirement obligations are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs. When assessing if these assets are impaired, the Company considers many factors and makes certain assumptions when making this assessment, including but not limited to: general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and

expected timing of lease-up. The fair value of the long-lived assets, intangibles, and asset retirement obligations is calculated using a discounted cash flow model. During the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company recognized a

sset

impairment

and decommission costs

of

$23.8

million and

$29.0

million, respectively. The

asset

impairment

and decommission costs

include the write off of

$16.8

million and

$23.1

million in carrying value of decommissioned

towers

and other third party decommission costs incurred related to the Company’s long-lived assets and intangibles for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively. These write offs result from the Company’s analysis that the future cash flows from certain

towers

would not recover the carrying value of the investment in those

towers

. There were

no

write offs for decommissioned

towers

and other third party decommission costs, related to its long-lived assets and intangibles for the year ended December 31,


.

Asset i

mpairment

and decommission costs

for all periods presented and the related impaired assets relate to the Company’s site leasing operating segment.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, and short-term investments approximate their estimated fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments. Short-term investments consisted of

$5.3

million and

$5.2

million in certificate of deposits, as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of its held-to-maturity investments in treasury and corporate bonds, including current portion, are based primarily upon Level 1 reported market values. As of

December 31, 2014

, the carrying value and fair value of the held-to-maturity investments, including current portion, were

$1.0

million and

$1.1

million, respectively

. As of

December 31, 2013

, the carrying value and fair value of the held-to-maturity investments, including current portion, was

$1.1

million and

$1.3

million, respectively.

F-



The Company determines fair value of its debt instruments utilizing various Level 2 sources including quoted prices and indicative quotes (non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices. The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility is considered to approximate the carrying value because the interest payments are based on Eurodollar rates that reset every month. The Company does not believe its credit risk has changed materially from the date the applicable Eurodollar Rate plus

187.5

to

237.5

basis points was set for the Revolving Credit Facility. The following table reflects fair values, principal balances, and carrying values of the Company’s debt instruments (see Note 13).

4.

RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash consists of the following:

Pursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities (see Note 13), the Company is required to establish a securitization escrow account, held by the indenture trustee, into which all rents and other sums due on the

towers

that secure the Tower Securities are directly deposited by the lessees. These restricted cash amounts are used to fund reserve accounts for the payment of (1) debt service costs, (2) ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums related to

towers

, (3) trustee and servicing expenses, (4) management fees, and (5) to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants. The restricted cash in the

securitization escrow

account in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 13) monthly, provided that the Borrowers are in compliance with their debt service coverage ratio and that no event of default has occurred. All monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

F-



Payment and performance bonds relate primarily to collateral requirements for

tower

construction currently in process by the Company. Cash is pledged as collateral related to surety bonds issued for

the benefit of the Company or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business and primarily related to the Company’s tower removal obligations. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had

$38.3

million in surety, payment and performance bonds for which it is only required to post

$1.7

million in collateral. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $42.0 million in surety, payment and performance bonds for which it is only required to post $6.1 million in collateral. The Company periodically evaluates the collateral posted for its bonds to ensure that it meets the minimum requirements. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had also pledged

$2.6

million and

$2.3

million

, respectively, as collateral related to its workers compensation policy. Restricted cash for surety bonds and workers compensation are included in other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company recorded these amounts in prepaid rent on its Consolidated Balance Shee

The estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to

one

year from the particular acquisition date). The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration and any related tax impact

.

The fair values of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. During the measurement period, the Company will adjust assets and/or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in a revised estimated value of those assets and/or liabilities as of that date. The effect of material measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values is reflected as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date. The impact of all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could be subject to a possible impairment of the intangible assets, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets in subsequent periods.

Subsequent to December 31, 2014,

the Company

acquired


towers and related assets for

$35.7

million

in cash.

Foreign Currency Forward Contract

On March 26, 2014, the Company settled  two foreign currency contracts entered into during the quarter with an aggregate notional amount of

R$

1,525.0

million in order to hedge the purchase price of the Oi S.A. acquisition in Brazil, which closed on March 31, 2014. During the

first quarter

, the Company realized a gain of

$17.9

million related to these foreign currency forward contracts

which is included in other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Net cash used in investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

.

On September 29, 2014, the Company executed put and call option contracts settling on November 25, 2014

which

we

re intended to limit

F-



exposure to movements in the related exchange rates and were entered into in contemplation of the purchase of the Oi S.A. acquisition that close

d on

December 1, 2014. These options create

d

a floor price for the purchase of Brazilian Rea

i

s of

2.4

and a ceiling price of

2.5665

.

Since the closing price was within the floor and ceiling price, no gain or loss was realized.

The Company measures its foreign currency forward contracts, which are recorded in Prepaid and other current assets, at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets (Level 2 inputs). These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and as such any gains and losses are reflected within Other Income, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Senior Credit Agreement

On February 7, 2014, SBA Senior Finance II entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things,

incur the 2014 Term Loan and

amend certain terms of the existing senior credit agreement

(as amended, the “Senior Credit Agreement”)

.

Terms of the Senior Credit Agreement

The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, requires SBA Senior Finance II to maintain specific financial ratios, including (1) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA not to exceed

6.5

times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net Hedge Exposure (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed

6.5

times for


consecutive days and (3) a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than

2.0

times for any fiscal quarter. The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of SBA Senior Finance II and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments,

enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into

F-



transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of their property. As of December 31, 2014, SBA Senior

Finance II was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit Agreement. The Senior Credit Agreement is also subject to customary events of default. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loans and certain hedging transactions that may be entered into by SBA Senior Finance II or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the membership interests of SBA Telecommunications, LLC, SBA Senior Finance, LLC and SBA Senior Finance II and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real property) of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary Guarantors.

The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, permits SBA Senior Finance II, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide SBA Senior Finance II with increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans provided that after giving effect to the proposed increase in Revolving Credit Facility commitments or incremental term loans the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA would not exceed 6.5 times. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans is subject to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and, with respect to any additional term loan, an increase in the margin on existing term loans to the extent required by the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon SBA Senior Finance II’s request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Facility commitment or whether to provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms.

Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement

On February 5, 2015, SBA Senior Finance II entered into the 2015 Revolving Refinancing Amendment with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Senior Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the availability under

the Company’s

Revolving Credit Facility from

$770.0

million to

$1.0

billion, (ii) extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to February 5, 2020, (iii) provide for the ability to borrow in U.S. dollars and certain designated foreign currencies, and (iv) lower the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility.

As amended

February 2015

, the Revolving Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with specific financial ratios and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing.  Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin that ranges from

137.5

basis points to

200.0

basis points or (ii) the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from

37.5

basis points to

100.0

basis points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA, calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement.  In addition, SBA Senior Finance II is required to pay a commitment fee of

0.25%

per annum on the amount of unused commitment.  If not earlier terminated by SBA Senior Finance II, the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on, and SBA Senior Finance II will repay all amounts outstanding on or before,

February 5, 2020

.  The proceeds available under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.  SBA Senior Finance II may, from time to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of a period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.

Secured Tower Revenue Securities

Tower Revenue Securities Terms

The mortgage loan underlying the 2010 Tower Securities, 2012 Tower Securities, 2013 Tower Securities, and 2014 Tower Securities (together the “Tower Securities”) will be paid from the operating cash flows from the

aggregate

9,659

tower sites

owned

by the Borrowers. The mortgage loan is secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust, and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower sites, (ii) a security interest in the tower sites and substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (iii) the Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases, and (iv) all of the proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar month, SBA Network Management, Inc., an indirect subsidiary, is entitled to receive a management fee equal to

4.5%

of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.

The Borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (i) within

nine

months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2010 Tower Securities)

In all other circumstances, the Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. The prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the Tower Securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid, calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement, on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date within

To the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (i)

5%

and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the

ten

, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.

F-



Pursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the towers owned by the Borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a securitization escrow account and are held by the indenture trustee. The monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 4). However, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to

1.30x

or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio falls below

1.15x

as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. In addition, if either the 2010-2 Tower Securities, 2012 Tower Securities, 2013 Tower Securities, or the 2014 Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the towers owned by the Borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the Tower Securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the Tower Securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those towers, third to pay the management fees due to SBA Network Management, Inc., fourth to repay principal of the Tower Securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above. The mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Borrowers met the required Debt Service Coverage Ratio as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants.

Stock Options

The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses a combination of historical data and historical volatility to establish the expected volatility. Historical data is used to estimate the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:

Amounts are included in Prepaid and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(2)

Of these

amounts,

$451

and

$(77,822)

are included in Other assets and Other long-term liabilities, respectively on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2014

. As of

,

$232

and

$(68,750)

are included in Other assets and Other long-term liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of its deferred tax assets as management believes that it is not “more-likely-than-not” that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to recognize the assets.

Valuation allowances

of

$267.3

million

and

$246.5

million were being carried to offset net deferred income tax assets as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively. The net increase in the valuation allowance for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


was

$20.8

million and

$12.8

million, respectively. At

December 31, 2014

,

the valuation allowance related to federal and state tax credit carryovers w

ere

approximately

$2.0

million and

$0.4

million, respectively. These tax credits

expire beginning


.

The Company has available a

t

December 31, 2014

, a net federal operating tax loss carry-forward of approximately

$1.1

billion and an additional

$227.4

million of

net operating tax loss carry forward from stock options which will benefit additional paid-in capital when the loss is utilized. These net operating tax loss carry-forwards will expire

between


and


. The Internal Revenue Code places limitations upon the future availability of net operating losses based upon changes in the equity of the Company. If these occur, the ability of the Company to offset future income with existing net operating losses may be limited. In addition, the Company has available at

December 31, 2014

, a foreign net operating loss carry-forward of

$39.5

million and a net state operating tax loss carry-forward of approximately

$558.0

million. These net operating tax loss carry-forwards

beg

i

n to

expire

in


.

In accordance with the Company’s methodology for determining when stock option deductions are deemed realized, the Company utilizes a “with-and-without” approach that will result in a benefit not being recorded in APIC if the amount

of available net operating loss carry-forwards generated from operations is sufficient to offset the current year taxable income.

The Company does not expect to remit

earnings from its foreign subsidiaries. Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to

approximately

$22.7

million

at

December 31, 2014

. Those earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly,

no

U.S. Federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company could be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.

In 2014

,

the Company recognized a deemed dividend of $10.6 million.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

The Company is obligated under various non-cancelable operating leases for land, office space, equipment and site leases that expire at various times

through

July 2114

. In

addition, the Company is obligated under various non-cancelable capital leases for vehicles that expire at various times through July 2018.

The annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases in effect as of

December 31, 2014

are as follows (in thousands):

Future minimum rental payments under noncancelable ground leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the Company’s option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower and related revenue from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the Company will renew the lease. The majority of operating leases provide for renewal at varying escalations. Fixed rate escalations have been included in the table disclosed above.

F-



Rent expense for operating leases was

$223.4

million,

$196.3

million and

$133.1

million for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively. In addition, certain of the Company’s leases include contingent rent provisions which provide for the lessor to receive additional rent upon the attainment of certain tower operating results and/or lease-up. Contingent rent expense for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


was

$23.3

million,

$20.3

million and

$16.1

million, respectively.

Tenant Leases

The annual minimum tower lease income to be received for tower space and antenna rental under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of

December 31, 2014

is as follows:

The Company’s tenant leases provide for annual escalations and multiple renewal periods, at the tenant’s option. The tenant rental payments disclosed in the table above do not assume exercise of tenant renewal options, however, fixed rate escalations have been included.

Litigation

The Company is involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such matters and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs that may be incurred, management believes the resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Contingent Purchase Obligations

From time to time, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration (or earnouts) for acquisitions if the towers or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets in the

one

to

three

years after they have been acquired. For the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and 2012 certain earnings targets associated with the acquired towers were achieved,

and therefore, the Company paid in cash

$18.7

million

,

$9.3

million,

and

$5.9

million,

respectively. As of December 31, 2014, the Company’s estimate of its potential obligation if the performance targets contained in various acquisition agreements were met was

$15.1

million which the Company recorded in accrued expenses. The maximum potential obligation related to the performance targets was

$23.1

million

and

$42.1

million as of

December 31, 2014

and 2013, respectively.

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (unaudited)

Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares for the period. Potentially dilutive instruments have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.

Because loss per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total loss per share amounts for the year.
