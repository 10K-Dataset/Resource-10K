PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

General

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the
continental United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  We generate revenues from our two primary businesses, site leasing and site development. In our site leasing business, we lease antenna space on towers and other structures
that we own or manage for others. The towers that we own have either been built by us at the request of a wireless carrier or built or acquired based on our own initiative.  As of December 31, 2002, we owned or managed 3,877 towers.  In
our site development business, we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks, including designing a network with friendly site identification, acquiring locations to place their antennas and transmission equipment,
obtaining zoning approvals, building towers when necessary and installing and maintaining their antennas and transmission equipment. Since our founding in 1989, we have participated in the development of more than 20,000 antenna sites in 49 of the
51 major wireless markets in the United States.

Recent Developments

As a result of certain estimates and our expectations that we will not comply with one or more of the financial covenants of our senior credit facility in 2003, the auditor’s opinion on our 2002 consolidated financial statements calls
attention to substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern through 2003.

On March 17, 2003 certain of our
subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with AAT Communications Corp. (“AAT Communications”) to sell 679 towers or, if AAT Communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers, an aggregate of 801 towers, which represent
substantially all of our towers in the western two-thirds of the U.S (the “AAT Transaction”).  Gross proceeds from the sale are anticipated to be $160.0 million if 679 towers are sold, or $203.0 million if 801 towers are sold, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances.  The AAT Transaction is expected to close in stages commencing on May 9, 2003 and ending on September 30, 2003.  We intend to use substantially all of the proceeds, net of anticipated transaction
costs of approximately $5.0 million, to reduce indebtedness.  Upon consummation of the complete AAT Transaction, we will own 3,076 towers, substantially all of which will be in the eastern third of the United States.

We entered into the AAT Transaction to address our anticipated non-compliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility commencing in
2003 and to reduce our significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness.  The sale is subject to a number of conditions, including an amendment to our senior credit facility.  We anticipate that the
amendment to our senior credit facility would, among other things, (1) waive any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification, (2) modify the financial covenants to levels that we
believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and (3) permit certain actions that are part of the AAT Transaction.  We believe that the AAT Transaction, in conjunction with the amendment
to the senior credit facility, will eliminate the issues that gave rise to the “going concern” qualification from our auditors.  Based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity, we believe that subsequent to the successful
sale of either 679 or 801 towers, and the amendment to the senior credit facility, we will have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow.

Company Services

We provide our services on a local basis, through regional offices, territory offices and project offices, which are opened and closed on a
project-by-project basis. Operationally, we are divided into regions throughout the United States, run by regional vice presidents. Each region is divided into sub-regions run by general managers and we have further divided each sub-region into
geographic territories run by local managers. Within each manager’s geographic area of responsibility, he or she is responsible for all operations, including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices, and a substantial portion of
the sales in such area.

Our executive, corporate development, accounting, finance, human resources, legal and regulatory, information
technology departments, site administration personnel, and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida. We also have in our Boca Raton office certain sales, new tower build support, and tower maintenance
personnel.

Site Leasing Services

In 1997 we began aggressively expanding
our site leasing business by capitalizing on our nationally recognized site development experience and strong relationships with wireless service providers to take advantage of the trends toward



co-location, which is the placement of multiple antennas on one tower or other structure, and independent tower ownership. We believe our towers have significant capacity to
accommodate additional tenants with minimal incremental costs. Additionally, due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we believe future expenditures required to maintain these towers will be minimal.

The following chart shows the number of towers we built for our own account, the number of towers we acquired and the number of tenants at year-end on our
towers, for the periods indicated:

(1)

Reclassifications reflect the combination for reporting purposes of multiple acquired tower structures on a single parcel of real estate, which we market and
customers view as a single location, into a single owned tower site.  Dispositions reflect the sale, conveyance or other legal transfer of owned tower sites.

(2)

Upon consummation of the AAT Transaction, we will own 3,076 towers (assuming AAT Communications purchases 801 towers).

At December 31, 2002, our same tower revenue growth on the 3,734 towers we owned as of December 31, 2001 was 16%, and our same tower cash flow growth on
these 3,734 towers was 20% based on tenant leases signed and annualized lease amounts in effect as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Our
site leasing revenue comes from a variety of wireless carrier tenants, including AT&T Wireless, Cingular, Nextel, Sprint PCS, T-Mobile, and Verizon.  Site leasing revenue was $139.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $103.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2001. We believe that over the long term our site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers continue to lease antenna space on our towers.

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts. We lease
antenna space on:

A significant number of our towers were built under our build-to-suit program, through which we built towers for a wireless service provider on a location of their
direction. We retained ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to co-locate additional tenants on the tower. Many wireless service providers chose the build-to-suit option as an alternative to owning the towers themselves. Our build-to-suit
sites came from a variety of wireless carriers, including Alamosa PCS, AT&T Wireless, Cingular, Horizon PCS, Sprint PCS, Triton PCS and T-Mobile.

To help maximize the revenue and profit we earn from our capital investment in the towers we own, we provide services at our tower locations beyond the leasing of
antenna space. The services we provide, or may provide in the future, include generator provisioning, antenna installation, equipment installation, maintenance, and backhaul, which is the transport of the wireless signals transmitted or received by
an antenna to a carrier’s network. Some of these services are recurring in nature, and are contracted for by a wireless carrier or other user in a manner similar to the way they lease antenna space.

In February 2002, we announced the reduction of our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities.  Under this plan, we suspended any
material new investment for additional towers, among other



actions.  If the AAT Transaction successfully closes, we will further reduce our tower portfolio by at least 679 towers and a maximum of 801 towers.  We do not
anticipate making any material additions to our tower portfolio in 2003.

Site Development Services

Our site development business consists of two segments, site development consulting and site development construction, through which we provide wireless service
providers a full range of end-to-end services. In the consulting segment of our site development business, we offer clients the following services: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and
antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; and (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits. In the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services, including, but not limited to the
following: (1) tower and related site construction; (2) antenna installation; and (3) radio equipment installation, commissioning and maintenance.  We have capitalized on our leadership position in the site development business and our strong
relationships with wireless service providers to build and acquire towers in locations that we believe are attractive to wireless service providers.

Our site development customers currently comprise many of the major wireless communications and services companies, including AT&T Wireless, Bechtel Corporation,
Cingular, Nextel, Sprint PCS, T-Mobile and Verizon.  Site development revenue was $125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Our site development revenues and profit margins decreased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2002.  This decrease was primarily attributable to
the substantial decline in capital expenditures by wireless carriers, particularly for our site development construction services, which adversely affected our volume of activity and our pricing levels.  During 2003, we expect these trends to
continue.  Consequently, we anticipate continued decline in our site development revenues and profit margins.

Business Strategy

Our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers.  Key elements of our
strategy include:

Maximizing Use of Tower Capacity.

We believe that many of our towers have significant
capacity available for additional antennae and that increased use of our owned towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost. We generally have constructed our towers to accommodate multiple tenants in addition to the anchor tenant, and a
substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers. We actively market space on our own towers through our internal sales force.

Geographically Focusing our Tower Ownership.

We have decided to focus our tower ownership geographically to the Eastern U.S.  Upon
consummation of the AAT Transaction, substantially all of our remaining towers will be located in the eastern third of the U.S.  We believe that by focusing our site leasing activities in a smaller geographic area, where we have such a high
concentration of our towers, we will improve our operating efficiencies and reduce our overhead expenses.

Executing on a Local
Basis.

We believe that substantially all of what we do is best done locally, given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities. We believe our customers make decisions locally. We believe that to be
successful in tower leasing, zoning and construction, we must have a strong local presence in the markets we serve.

Capitalizing on
our Management Experience.

Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development services. Management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless carriers will
allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site development services.

Building on Strong Relationships with Major
Wireless Service Providers.

We are well positioned to be a preferred partner in tower space leasing because of our strong relationships with wireless service and other telecommunications providers and our proven operating
experience.  Additionally, we have a broad national field organization that allows us to identify and participate in site development projects across the country and that gives us knowledge of local markets and enhances our customer
relationships.

Capturing Other Revenues That Flow From our Tower Ownership.

Tenants who
lease antenna space on our towers need a variety of additional services in connection with their operations at the tower site. These services include installation, maintenance and upgrading of radio transmission equipment, antennas, cabling and
other connection equipment, electricity, backhaul (which is provided generally by telephone lines or a microwave antenna network),



equipment shelters, data collection and network monitoring. Tenants often outsource the performance of some or all of these required services to third parties, including us.
Because of our ownership of the tower, our control of the tower site and our experience and capabilities in providing these types of services, we believe that we are well positioned and intend to perform more of these services and capture the
related revenue.

Customers

Since commencing operations, we have performed
site leasing and site development services for many of the largest wireless service providers. The majority of our contracts have been for PCS broadband, ESMR and cellular customers. We also serve wireless data and Internet, paging, PCS narrowband,
SMR, multi-channel multi-point distribution service, or MMDS, and multi-point distribution service, or MDS, wireless providers. In both our site development and site leasing businesses, we work with large national providers and smaller local,
regional or private operators.  We depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site development and site leasing revenues.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, Cingular provided 14.6% and Bechtel Corporation (contractor for
AT&T Wireless and Cingular) provided 29.4% of our site development revenues.  For the year ended December 31, 2001, Nextel provided 11.6%, Sprint PCS provided 11.5% and Bechtel Corporation provided 10.9% of our site development
revenues.  In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2002, AT&T Wireless provided 15.7% of our site leasing revenues.  For the year ended December 31, 2001, Nextel provided 10.4% of our site leasing revenues.

During the past two years, we provided services for a number of customers, including:

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing goals are:

We approach sales on a company-wide basis, involving many of our employees. We have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive
management team. Our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office. We also rely on our regional vice presidents, general managers, local managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate
customers. Our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with the wireless service providers. Most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local
offices. We believe that providers at the regional and local levels make most decisions for site development and site leasing services with input from their corporate headquarters. Our sales representatives work with provider representatives at the
regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate. Our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentive-based goals and measurements. A substantial number of our operations personnel have sales-based incentive components
in their compensation plans.



In addition to our marketing and sales staff, we rely upon our executive and operations personnel on the regional
and territory office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts.

Our primary marketing and sales support
is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in Boca Raton, Florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices. We have a full-time staff dedicated to our marketing efforts. The marketing and sales support staff is charged
with implementing our marketing strategies, prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals.

Competition

We compete with:

Wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do. We
believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing
business.

Our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are four large independent tower companies, American Tower
Corporation, Crown Castle International Corp., Pinnacle Holdings Inc. and SpectraSite, Inc., and a large number of smaller independent tower owners.  In addition, we compete with AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS and other wireless service
providers who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers.

We believe that the majority of
our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively, while some firms appear to offer their services nationally, including American Tower Corporation, AFL, Bechtel Corporation, Black & Veach, General
Dynamics, and Westower.  The market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site development consultants, zoning consultants, real
estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors, which provide end-to-end site development services through multiple
subcontractors, and providers’ internal staff. We believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria, including a company’s experience, track record, local reputation, price and time for
completion of a project. We believe that we compete favorably in these areas.

Employees

As of February 28, 2003, we had approximately 650 employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to
be good.

Regulatory and Environmental Matters

Federal
Regulations.

Both the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) regulate towers used for wireless communications. These regulations govern the
construction and marking and painting of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require prior approval and registration of towers. Wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and
independently licensed based upon the particular frequency or frequency band used.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, the FCC, in conjunction with the FAA, has developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified towers. These standards mandate that the FCC and the FAA consider the height of proposed tower structures, the
relationship of the structure to existing natural or man-made obstructions and the proximity of the towers to runways and airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the FAA to ensure the
structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. The FAA may condition its issuance of a no-hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting, marking and/or painting requirements. Towers that meet certain height and location
criteria must also be



registered with the FCC. A tower that requires FAA clearance will not be registered by the FCC until it is cleared by the FAA. Upon registration, the FCC may also require
special lighting, marking and/or painting requirements. Owners of wireless transmission towers may have an obligation to maintain marking, painting and lighting to conform to FAA and FCC standards. Tower owners also bear the responsibility of
monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the FAA of any tower lighting outage or malfunction. In addition, any applicant for an FCC antenna structure registration must certify that, consistent with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, neither the
applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of Federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance. We generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable
regulatory standards. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996
amended the Communications Act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction, modification and placement of towers. The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that
would (1) discriminate between different providers of personal wireless services or (2) ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of radio communication towers. Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the federal
government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities. This may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower
facilities.

Owners and operators of towers may be subject to, and therefore must comply with, environmental laws. Any licensed radio
facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of their decisions under certain circumstances. The FCC has
issued regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. These regulations place responsibility on each applicant to investigate any potential environmental effects of operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the
environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing a tower. In the event the FCC determines the proposed tower would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the FCC has developed, the FCC would be required to
prepare an environmental assessment, which will be subject to public comment. This process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower.

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on-site or
off-site contamination and related personal or property damage. We are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement, including pre-construction environmental studies. Operators of towers must also take into consideration
certain RF emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements. The potential connection between RF emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial
study by the scientific community in recent years. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws. These costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws
and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

State and Local Regulations.

Most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition and leasing activities and construction
activities. Where required, we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents, who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors, and conduct the
construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors, who may be our employees or independent contractors. Local regulations include city and other local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants
imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding
maintenance and removal of towers.  In addition, many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations.  Local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to
construction of new transmission towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers, and have, in some instances, instituted moratoria.

Backlog

Our backlog for site development services was $29.2 million as of December 31, 2002 as compared to $58.8 million as of December 31,
2001.  We had no backlog for pending tower acquisitions as of December 31, 2002 as compared to 145 towers as of December 31, 2001.  Additionally, we had a backlog for 15 new tower builds as of December 31, 2002 as compared to 400 as of
December 31, 2001.

RISK FACTORS

Our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business.

Our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our 10¼% senior notes and our 12% senior discount notes each contain certain restrictive covenants. Among
other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell assets for less than fair market value, pay dividends, redeem outstanding debt or engage in other restricted payments. If we fail to comply with these
covenants, it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments.  The acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility will also cause a cross-default under both of our indentures.

SBA Telecommunications, Inc. (“SBA Telecommunications”), our principal subsidiary which owns, directly or indirectly, all of the common stock of
our other subsidiaries, is the borrower under our senior credit facility. The senior credit facility requires SBA Telecommunications to maintain specified financial ratios, including ratios regarding SBA Telecommunications’ consolidated debt
coverage, debt service, cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining a minimum consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash
charges and unusual or non-recurring expenses).  The senior credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, require us to submit audited financial statements without a “going-concern”
qualification in the audit opinion and restricts our ability to incur debt and liens, sell assets, commit to capital expenditures, enter into affiliate transactions or sale-leaseback transactions, and/or build towers without anchor tenants. 
Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to do so.  A breach of any of these covenants, if not remedied within the specified period, could result in an event of
default under the senior credit facility.  Based on declines that we have been experiencing in our site development business and that we believe will continue in 2003, we estimated that we would not be in compliance with one or more of the
senior credit facility’s existing financial ratios or tests in 2003.

As a result of these estimates and our expectations that we
will not comply with one or more of the financial covenants of our senior credit facility in 2003, the auditor’s opinion on our 2002 consolidated financial statements calls attention to substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a
going concern through 2003.

The issuance of this audit opinion with a “going-concern” qualification, if not remedied by
April 30, 2003, would be an event of default under our senior credit facility.  Upon the occurrence of this, or any other event of default, our lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior credit facility. 
In addition, upon the occurrence of any event of default, other than certain bankruptcy events, our senior credit facility lenders, by a majority vote, can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility,
together with all accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. The acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility would cause a cross-default in our 10¼% senior notes and our 12% senior discount notes, thereby permitting
the acceleration of such indebtedness.  If the indebtedness under the senior credit facility and/or indebtedness under our 10¼% senior notes or 12% senior discount notes were to be accelerated, our current assets would not be sufficient to
repay in full the indebtedness.  If we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior credit facility, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. Substantially all of our assets
are pledged as security under the senior credit facility.

As part of our plan to addresss the anticipated non-compliance with these
financial covenants, and to reduce our aggregate level of indebtedness, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with AAT Communications to sell 679 towers or, if AAT Communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers,
an aggregate of 801 towers.  The gross proceeds from the sale are anticipated to be $160.0 million if 679 towers are sold, or $203.0 million if 801 towers are sold, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  However, the AAT
Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including an amendment to our senior credit facility.  We anticipate that the amendment to our senior credit facility would, among other things, (1) waive any default that arises as a result of
receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification, (2) modify the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and (3) permit



certain actions that are part of the AAT Transaction.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these waivers and/or amendments, especially in light of the
recent financial performance of the wireless telecommunications industry and us, or that if we obtain them, we will be able to comply with the new financial covenants in the future.  Nor can we assure you that even if we do receive the
necessary amendment to our senior credit facility that the AAT Transaction will be consummated.

A full discussion of the impact of these
possible defaults and management’s plans to address the liquidity and other concerns that arise as a result of the possible defaults and our significant level of indebtedness is discussed below under the section entitled “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Going Concern.”

We may not be able to service our
substantial indebtedness.

As indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to
our equity.

Our substantial indebtedness could
have important consequences to you. For example, it could:

Our ability to service our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. Based on our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2002, we would require
approximately $92.3 million of cash flow from operations (before net cash interest expenses) to discharge our cash interest and principal obligations for the twelve months ending December 31, 2003.  This amount is expected to increase in 2004
as our 12% senior discount notes first began to pay cash interest on March 1, 2003.  By comparison, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we generated $57.1 million of cash flow from operations (before net cash interest
expenses).  If we do not materially increase our cash flow in the future, we may not be able to meet our principal and interest payments on our debt obligations.  In order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness, we may from time
to time sell assets, issue equity, or repurchase, restructure or refinance some or all of our debt. We may not be able to effectuate any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms, if at all. The implementation of any of these alternative
strategies may dilute our current shareholders, subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy.

Based on our current estimates, we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay the full principal amount of our 12% senior
discount notes and/or our 10¼% senior notes upon their respective maturities.  Therefore, prior to the maturity of our notes we may be required to refinance and/or restructure some or all of our outstanding notes.  There can be no
assurance that we will be able to refinance or restructure these notes on acceptable terms or at all.  If we were unable to refinance, restructure or otherwise repay the principal amount of these notes upon their maturity, we may need to sell
assets, cease operations and/or file for protection under the bankruptcy laws.

We pay interest on amounts outstanding under our senior
credit facility at variable interest rates. We have in the past, and may again in the future, enter into interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our debt from fixed to



variable rates. Therefore, if interest rates were to increase, the amount of interest that we would have to pay would increase.

We may be adversely affected by an economic slowdown.

The significant general slowdown in the U.S. economy has negatively affected (1) the financial condition of wireless service providers, (2) the availability of
capital, and the willingness of wireless service providers to utilize capital, to expand their networks and (3) may negatively affect the growth rate of consumer demand for wireless services.  We believe that the environment for continued
expenditures by wireless service providers deteriorated throughout 2002 and has not materially improved.  Declining subscriber growth and prospects for positive cash flow by wireless service providers have adversely affected the access to and
cost of capital for wireless service provides as evidenced by declines in the market value of both their debt and equity securities.  As a result of the economic slowdown, and the negative impact of such slowdown on the debt and equity markets,
we have adjusted our business to significantly reduce and subsequently suspend any material new investment for new towers.

We believe
that if the capital markets conditions remain difficult for the telecommunications industry, wireless service providers will continue to choose to conserve capital and may not spend as much as originally anticipated.  If wireless carrier
capital expenditures and their ability to access capital remains weak or deteriorates further, we believe our revenues and gross profit from the site development consulting and construction segments of our business, potentially the collectibility of
our accounts receivable, and the valuation of certain of our long-lived assets may be negatively impacted.   Short term, variable capital markets conditions may adversely impact carrier demand for our tower space, and consequently our site
leasing revenue and the ability of our customers to meet their obligations to us.

We may not secure as many site leasing tenants as
planned.

If tenant demand for tower space decreases, we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business. This may
have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our obligations. Our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future
tenant demand for independently-owned towers. Tenant demand includes both the number of tenants and the lease rates they are willing to pay.

Wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and several of the independent tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater
financial resources than we do. We believe that tower location and capacity, price, quality of service and density within a geographic market historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site
leasing business.

If our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our
growth, our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flow could be adversely affected.

Significant consolidation among our
wireless service provider customers may result in reduced capital expenditures in the aggregate because the existing networks of many wireless carriers overlap, as do their expansion plans.  Similar consequences might occur if wireless service
providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antennae space.  In January 2003, the spectrum cap, which previously prohibited wireless carriers from owning more than 45 MHz of spectrum
in any given geographical area, expired.  Some wireless carriers may be encouraged to consolidate with each other as a result of this regulatory change and as a means to strengthen their financial condition.  Demand for antennae space on
communication sites may be adversely affected by consolidation of our wireless service provider customers. Economic conditions have resulted in the consolidation of several wireless service providers and this trend is likely to continue. To the
extent that our customers consolidate, they may terminate any duplicative leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as many spaces on our towers in the future. This would adversely affect our growth, our revenue and our ability to
generate positive cash flow.

Wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them
to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services. Wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing
antenna space on communications sites owned or controlled by us or others. The proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.



If demand for wireless communication services decreases, our revenue will be adversely affected.

Substantially all of our customers to date have been providers of wireless communication services or agents acting on behalf of wireless
communication providers.  If demand for wireless communication services decreases, our revenue growth will be, and our revenue may be, adversely affected.  This could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations. Demand for both our site
leasing and site development services is dependent on demand for communication sites from wireless service providers, which, in turn, is dependent on the demand for wireless services.  A slowdown in the growth of, or reduction in demand in, a
particular wireless communication segment could adversely affect the demand for communication sites.  Most types of wireless services currently require ground-based network facilities, including communication sites for transmission and
reception.  The extent to which wireless service providers lease these communication sites depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers that vary at any given time, particularly in the site development services side of our
business.  The loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.

Following is a list of
significant customers and the percentage of total revenues derived from such customers:

We also have client concentrations
with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments.  Of our total site development consulting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, the following two customers represented 63.8% of total revenue from this segment:
Cingular represented 29.6% and Bechtel Corporation represented 34.2%.  Of our total site development construction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, one customer, Bechtel Corporation, represented 28.1% of such revenue.  Of our
total site leasing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, one customer, AT&T Wireless, represented 15.7% of such revenue.

Revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. Each site leasing contract relates to the lease
of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of 5 years renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant.  Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can
generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. In addition, a customer’s need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. Moreover, our existing
customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects.



Due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, the tower industry is very sensitive to the
creditworthiness of its tenants.

Due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we, like others in the tower industry, are
dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants.  Wireless service providers often operate with substantial leverage, and financial problems for our customers could result in uncollected accounts receivable, in the loss of
customers and the anticipated lease revenues, or in a reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities. During the past three years, a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our
paging customers. Although these bankruptcies have not yet had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues, pending bankruptcies and any future bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, and/or the
collectibility of our accounts receivable.

Our quarterly operating results fluctuate and therefore should not be considered indicative
of our long-term results.

The number of tenants we add to our towers and the demand for our site development services fluctuate
from quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of long-term results. Numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including:

Although the demand for our services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts.
The timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments, budgetary cycles and pressures and general economic conditions. In addition, under
lease terms typical in the tower industry, revenue generated by new tenant leases usually commences upon installation of the tenant’s equipment on the tower rather than upon execution of the lease, which can be 90 days or more after the
execution of the lease.

We are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses.

We are not profitable.  The following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated:

Our losses are principally due to significant interest expense and depreciation and amortization in each of the
years 2002, 2001 and 2000, restructuring and other charges of $77.6 million and $24.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and an $80.6 million charge related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2002 related to the
adoption of SFAS No. 142.

We expect to continue to have significant losses in 2003.  Interest expense and depreciation charges
will continue to be substantial in 2003.  We also expect to incur additional restructuring expenses and to record an expense associated with the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No.
143.  Furthermore, in connection with the anticipated sale of the 679 towers on May 9, 2003, we anticipate recognizing a loss of approximately $6.5 million.



As a result of these factors, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur significant losses.

Our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business.

We are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business. Both the FCC and the FAA regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio
and television antennae. In addition, the FCC separately licenses and regulates wireless communication devices and television and radio stations operating from towers. Such regulations control construction, lighting, painting and marking of towers
and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower, require registration of tower facilities. Certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the FAA to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to
air navigation. Tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or install lighting to conform to FAA standards and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. Tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of
any tower lighting failures. Failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to
comply. In addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth.

Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically
require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification.  Local regulations can delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new tower construction, co-locations,
or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. In addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our
future growth and operations.

Our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters.

Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. We maintain insurance to cover the estimated
cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. We also maintain third party liability insurance to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. A tower accident for which we
are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a tower or group of towers, could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.

Steven E. Bernstein controls the outcome of shareholder votes and therefore disinterested shareholders will not control many corporate governance matters.

Steven E. Bernstein, our Chairman of the Board, controls 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Our Class B common
stock has the right to 10 votes for each share provided that the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent more than 10% of the aggregate amount of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. As of March 14, 2003, the Class B common
stock represented 10.7% of the aggregate amount of common stock outstanding. As of March 14, 2003, Mr. Bernstein controlled approximately 55% of the total voting power of both classes of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Bernstein has the ability
to control the outcome of all matters determined by a majority vote of our common shareholders when voting together as a single class. Consequently, disinterested shareholders will not be able to determine who is elected as a director or the outcome
of other corporate governance matters subject to approval by the majority of the outstanding shares.

The loss of the services of
certain of our key senior executives may negatively affect our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon
performance and active participation of our key senior executives.  We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key senior executives.  We have employment agreements with Jeffrey A. Stoops, our
President and Chief Executive Officer, Kurt L. Bagwell, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Thomas P. Hunt, our Senior Vice President and General Counsel.  We do not have employment agreements with any of our other key
senior executive officers.  If we were to lose any key senior executive we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. Our Chief Financial Officer resigned as
of March 31, 2003 and we are currently seeking his replacement.



If we are unable to attract, retain or manage skilled employees it could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Our business, particularly site development services, involves the delivery of professional services and is
labor-intensive. The loss of a significant number of employees, our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees or adequately develop and motivate the skilled employees we have hired could have a material adverse effect on our
business. We compete with other wireless communications firms and other enterprises for employees with the skills required to perform our services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly-skilled
employees in the future or that we will continue to be successful in training, retaining and motivating employees.

Our dependence on
our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business.

We are a holding company with no business operations of our own.
Our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our only significant asset is, and is expected to be, the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries. We conduct, and expect to conduct, all of
our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations is distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow. We currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our
subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their debt obligations, except as necessary to be distributed to us to cover holding company expenses including interest payments on our 10¼% senior notes
and 12% senior discount notes. Even if our subsidiaries determined to make a distribution to us, applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including dividend covenants contained in our senior credit facility, may restrict or prohibit these
dividends or distributions.

We may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect the value of your investment.

The stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price
for the common stock of companies. In the past, certain broad market fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a decline in the
market price of our Class A common stock.

We have adopted anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third
party to acquire us.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law could make it more difficult for a
third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. During 2002, we adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in
a transaction that our board of directors opposes. These provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment
of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our Class A common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency emissions, especially if such emissions are
demonstrated to cause negative health effects.

The government imposes requirements and other guidelines on our towers relating to
radio frequency emissions. The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. 
To date, the results of these studies have been inconclusive.  However, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn
slow our growth.  In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services.

If a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous
claims.  If we were subject to numerous claims relating to radio frequency emissions, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our operations, costs and revenues would be materially and adversely affected.

New technologies may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations.

The emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. This could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of
operations. For example, the FCC has granted license applications for several low-earth orbiting satellite systems that are intended to provide mobile voice and data services. These systems



are highly capital intensive and mobile satellite systems could compete with land-based wireless communications systems. In addition, products are currently being developed
which may permit multiple wireless carriers to use a single antenna, to share networks, or to increase the range and capacity of an antenna, which, if successful, could reduce the number of antenna needed by our customers.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

We are headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, where we
currently lease approximately 73,000 square feet of space. We have entered into long-term leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longer-term. We open and close project offices from time
to time in connection with our site development business, and offices for new tower build projects are generally leased for periods not to exceed 18 months. Our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee interests, leasehold interests
created by long-term lease agreements, private easements, easements and licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We
are not a party to any legal proceeding, the adverse outcome of which, individually or taken together with all other legal proceedings, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table sets forth selected historical financial and other data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998.  The
historical financial data has been derived from, and is qualified by reference to, our audited financial statements. The information set forth below should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, selling, general and administrative expense includes non-cash compensation expense of $2.0 million in connection with stock option grants,
restricted stock grants and the issuance of Class A common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative expense included non-cash compensation expense of $3.3 million in connection with stock option and restricted
stock activity. For the year ended December 31, 2000, selling, general and administrative expenses included non-cash compensation expense of $0.3 million incurred in connection with the issuance of stock options and Class A common stock. For the
year ended December 31, 1999, selling, general and administrative expense included non-cash compensation expense of $0.3 million incurred in connection with stock option activity.  For the year ended December 31, 1998, selling, general and
administrative expense included non-cash compensation of $0.6 million incurred in connection with stock option activity.

EBITDA represents earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges (including those referred to in footnote (1) above) and unusual or
non-recurring expenses. EBITDA is commonly used in the telecommunications industry to analyze companies on the basis of operating performance, leverage and liquidity. EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor has
it been presented as an alternative to operating income or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Companies calculate EBITDA differently and, therefore, EBITDA as presented by us may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. See our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in our Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this filing.

We define “tower cash flow” as site leasing revenue less cost of site leasing revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), otherwise known as site leasing
gross profit.  Tower cash flow is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor has it been presented as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  We believe tower cash flow is useful to investors in evaluating our performance because it
allows you to measure the financial performance of our towers before the effect of expenses (selling, general and administrative) that do not relate directly to tower performance. We define ‘‘annualized tower cash flow’’ as tower
cash flow for the last calendar quarter attributable to our site leasing business multiplied by four.   Below is a reconciliation of annualized tower cash flow from site leasing revenue.

ITEM
7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We are a
leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the continental United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  We generate revenues from our two primary businesses, site leasing and site development. In our
site leasing business, we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own or manage for or lease from others. The towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a carrier, built or
constructed based on our own initiative or acquired. In our site development business, we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.

We are continuing to shift our revenue stream from project driven revenues to recurring revenues through the leasing of antenna space at, or on, communication
towers.  We intend to emphasize our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites.  Subsequent to the consummation of the AAT Transaction, we intend on focusing our leasing activities in the eastern third of the
United States where substantially all of our remaining towers will be located.

Site Leasing Services

Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies. Revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing
contracts. Each site leasing contract relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of 5 years, renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant.  Almost all of our site
leasing contracts contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. Site leasing contracts are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight-line
basis over the term of the related lease agreements. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue.

Cost of site leasing revenue consists of:

For any given tower, such
costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower.

Our same tower revenue growth on the 3,734 towers we owned as of December 31, 2001 was 16% and our same tower cash flow growth on these 3,734 towers was 20%, based on
site leasing contracts signed and annual lease contracts in effect as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.

In February 2002, we
announced the reduction of our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities.  Under this plan, we suspended any material new investment for additional towers, among other



actions.  If the AAT Transaction successfully closes, we will further reduce our tower portfolio by at least 679 towers and a maximum of 801 towers.  We do not
anticipate making any material additions to our tower portfolio in 2003.

Site Development Services

Site development services revenues are also received primarily from wireless communications companies or companies providing development or project management
services to wireless communications companies.  Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. Site development projects in which we
perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price, or milestone, basis.  Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development
contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis, we bill the client, and recognize revenue, based on the completion of agreed upon phases or milestones of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase we recognize the
revenue related to that phase. The majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis. Our site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete. Our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be
the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion.  Revenue from our site development
business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities, which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures, the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period,
weather and other factors.

Cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs, salaries and
labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects. All costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred.

Our site development revenues and profit margins decreased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2002.  This decrease
was primarily attributable to the substantial decline in capital expenditures by wireless carriers, particularly for our site development construction services, which adversely affected our volume of activity and our pricing levels.  During
2003, we expect these trends to continue.  Consequently, we anticipate continued decline in our site development revenues and profit margins.

2002 Developments

In February 2002, as a result of the continuing deterioration of the capital market conditions for wireless carriers, we announced that under a plan approved
by our Board of Directors we were reducing our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities, suspending any material new investment for additional towers, reducing our workforce and closing or consolidating
offices.  Under those capital market conditions, we did not anticipate building or buying a material number of new towers beyond those we were contractually obligated to build or buy, thereby resulting in the abandonment of a majority of our
then existing new tower build and acquisition work in process during 2002.  In connection with this restructuring, a portion of our workforce had been reduced and certain offices have been closed, substantially all of which were primarily
dedicated to new tower development activities.  In addition, during the first quarter of 2002, certain tower assets held and used in operations were determined to be impaired and written down to their fair value.  As a result of the
implementation of our plans, we recorded a restructuring charge of $63.7 million in accordance with SFAS 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

andEmerging Issues Task Force 94-3,

Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity, including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring.

Of the $63.7 million charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2002, approximately $40.4 million
related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process and related construction materials on approximately 764 sites and $16.4 million related to the impairment of approximately 144 tower sites held and used in
operations.  The abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process resulted in the write-off of all costs incurred to date.  The impairment of operating tower assets results primarily from our evaluation of the fair value of
our operating tower portfolio through a discounted cash flow analysis.  Towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no current tenants and little or no prospects for future lease-up.  The remaining $6.9 million related
primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 470 employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately 40 offices.  Exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of offices
primarily represented our estimate of future lease obligations after considering sublease opportunities.

On January 1, 2002, we adopted
SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Under SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of



impairment in value are present.  Under the transitional provisions of SFAS 142, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $80.6 million as of the effective date of
adoption, January 1, 2002.  The impairment charge has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.  Two of our three operating
segments were identified as reporting units in which we recognized an impairment loss.  Of the total $80.6 million cumulative effect adjustment,  $61.6 million related to the site development construction segment and $19.0 million related
to our site leasing segment.

During 2002, we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately $13.4 million resulting from the
achievement of certain earn-out obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2001.  In accordance with SFAS 142, in addition to the transitional test described above, goodwill is subject to an
impairment assessment at least annually, or at any time that indicators of impairment are present.  We determined that as of June 30, 2002 indicators of impairment were present, thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed.  The
indicators of impairment during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 giving rise to this analysis included significant deterioration of overall Company value, continued negative trends with respect to carrier capital expenditure plans and related demand
for wireless construction services and perceived reduction in value of similar site development construction services businesses.  As a result of this analysis, using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value, $13.4
million of goodwill within the site development construction reporting unit was determined to be impaired as of June 30, 2002 and was written off in the second quarter of 2002.  The $13.4 million goodwill impairment charge is included within
restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.  As of December 31, 2002 we did not have any remaining goodwill or other intangible assets subject to SFAS 142.

Since the beginning of 2002, the environment for continued expenditures by wireless service providers has deteriorated.  Declining subscriber
growth and prospects for positive cash flow by wireless service providers have adversely affected the access to and cost of capital for wireless service provides as evidenced by declines in the market value of both their debt and equity
securities.  We believe that if the capital market conditions remain difficult for the telecommunications industry, wireless service providers will choose to conserve capital and may not spend as much as originally anticipated.  If
wireless carrier capital expenditures and their ability to access capital remains weak or deteriorates further, we believe our revenues and gross profit from the site development consulting and construction segments of our business, potentially the
collectibility of our accounts receivable, and the valuation of certain of our long-lived assets may be negatively impacted.   Short term, variable capital markets conditions may adversely impact carrier demand for our tower space, and
consequently our site leasing revenue and the ability of our customers to meet their obligations to us.  We believe that, over the longer term however, site leasing revenues will continue to increase as carriers continue to deploy new antenna
sites to address issues of network capacity and quality.

2003 Developments

In February 2003, in response to the continued deterioration in expenditures by wireless service providers, particularly with respect to site development activities,
we committed to a new plan of restructuring associated with further downsizing activities, including reduction in workforce and closing or consolidation of offices.  We anticipate closing an additional 9 to 15 offices and eliminating the
positions of 70 to 100 employees during the first quarter of 2003, substantially all related to our site development operations.  We anticipate incurring a restructuring charge related to these costs of up to $2.0 million.

On March 17, 2003 certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with AAT Communications to sell 679 towers or, if AAT Communications elects
to purchase an additional 122 towers, an aggregate of 801 towers, which represent substantially all of our towers in the western two-thirds of the U.S.  Gross proceeds from the sale are anticipated to be $160.0 million if 679 towers are sold,
or $203.0 million if 801 towers are sold, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  The AAT Transaction is expected to close in stages commencing on May 9, 2003 and ending on September 30, 2003.  We intend to use substantially all
of the proceeds, net of anticipated transaction costs of approximately $5.0 million, to reduce indebtedness.  Upon consummation of the complete AAT Transaction, we will own 3,076 towers, substantially all of which will be in the eastern third
of the United States.

We entered into the AAT Transaction to address our anticipated non-compliance with certain financial
covenants under our senior credit facility commencing in 2003 and to reduce our significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness.  The sale is subject to a number of conditions, including an amendment to our
senior credit facility.  We anticipate that the amendment to our senior credit facility would, among other things, (1) waive any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification, (2)
modify the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and (3) permit certain actions that are part of the AAT Transaction.  We believe that the AAT
Transaction, in



conjunction with the anticipated amendment to the senior credit facility, will upon consummation, eliminate the issues that gave rise to the “going concern”
qualification from our auditors.  Based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity, we believe that subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers, and the anticipated amendment to the senior credit facility, we will
have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow.

Going Concern

We have significant borrowings under our senior credit facility, our 10¼% senior notes and our 12% senior discount notes, each containing certain
covenants.  Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell assets for less than fair market value, pay dividends, redeem outstanding debt or engage in other restricted payments.  If we fail
to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments.   The senior credit facility requires SBA Telecommunications to maintain specified financial ratios, including ratios
regarding it’s consolidated debt coverage, debt service, cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining a minimum consolidated EBITDA (earnings (loss) before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring expenses).  We were in full compliance with all of the financial ratios and tests as of December 31, 2002.  Based on declines that we have been
experiencing in our site development business and that we believe will continue in 2003, we estimated that we would not be in compliance with one or more of the senior credit facility’s existing financial ratios or tests in 2003.

As a result of these estimates and our expectations that we will not comply with one or more of the financial covenants of our senior credit
facility during 2003, the auditor’s opinion on our 2002 consolidated financial statements calls attention to substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern through 2003.

The issuance of this audit opinion with a “going-concern” qualification, if not remedied by April 30, 2003, would be an event of default under our senior
credit facility.  Upon the occurrence of this, or any other event of default, our lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior credit facility.  In addition, upon the occurrence of any event of default,
other than certain bankruptcy events, our senior credit facility lenders, by a majority vote, can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility, together with all accrued interest, to be immediately due and
payable.  The acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility would cause a cross-default in our 10¼% senior notes and our 12% senior discount notes, thereby permitting the acceleration of such indebtedness.  If the
indebtedness under the senior credit facility and/or indebtedness under our 10¼% senior notes or 12% senior discount notes were to be accelerated, our current assets would not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness.  If we were
unable to repay amounts that became due under the senior credit facility, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under the senior credit
facility.

As part of our plan to address our anticipated non-compliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit
facility commencing in 2003 and to reduce our significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with AAT Communications to sell 679 towers or, if AAT
Communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers, an aggregate of 801 towers.  We are also currently exploring, and may from time to time take advantage of various strategic opportunities including, but not limited to, the sale of
certain assets or lines of business, the issuance of equity or the repurchasing, restructuring, or refinancing of  some or all of our debt.  We believe that the AAT Transaction, in conjunction with the amendment to the senior credit
facility, will upon consummation, eliminate the issues that gave rise to the “going concern” qualification from our auditors with respect to our 2002 consolidated financial statements.  Furthermore, based on our current estimates,
subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers, and the amendment to the senior credit facility, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow.  However, we cannot assure you that either the AAT
Transaction and/or any other plan or action can be consummated, or if consummated, would effectively address our liquidity concerns, the possible defaults under our debt instruments or any of the other risks associated with our significant level of
indebtedness.

Based on our previous experience with our lender syndicate for our senior credit facility, we believe that we will be able
to successfully negotiate with our present senior credit bank syndicate, an amendment to our senior credit facility that (1) waives any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification, (2)
modifies the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and (3) permits certain actions that are part of the AAT Transaction.  This would thereby
permit us to prevent the occurrence of any event of default or the acceleration of our indebtedness.  However, our prior ability to obtain necessary waivers and/or amendments does not insure our ability to obtain these waivers and/or
amendments, especially in light of the recent financial performance of the wireless telecommunications industry and us.



The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from this uncertainty.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As we continue to shift our revenue mix more towards site leasing, operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results. You should
be aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results.

Year Ended 2002 Compared to Year Ended 2001

Total revenues increased 9.0% to $264.7 million for 2002 from $242.9 million for 2001. Total site development revenue decreased
10.5% to $125.0 million in 2002 from $139.7 million in 2001 due to a decrease in site development construction revenue. Site development construction revenue decreased 15.3% to $97.8 million for 2002 from $115.5 million for 2001, due primarily to
reduced carrier activity and price competition resulting from lower capital expenditures by wireless carriers on or around cell sites.  We believe that wireless carriers will continue to conserve capital in 2003, which may continue to adversely
affect site development revenues.  Site development consulting revenues increased 12.2% to $27.2 million for 2002 from $24.3 million for 2001.  This increase is due to several new contracts for site acquisition and zoning services from
wireless communications carriers.  Site leasing revenue increased 35.4% to $139.6 million for 2002 from $103.2 million for 2001, due to the increased number of tenants added to our towers, higher average rents received and the increase in the
number of towers in our portfolio.  If the AAT Transaction is consummated, with the sale of either 679 or 801 towers, we expect to have lower leasing revenue and tower cash flow, on an absolute basis, as a result of our reduced number of
towers.  We expect that leasing revenue and tower cash flow growth will continue to increase during 2003 on the towers remaining in our portfolio; however, the rate of such growth may be adversely affected by lower wireless carrier capital
expenditures.

Total cost of revenues increased 5.2% to $152.1 million for 2002 from $144.7 million for 2001. Site development cost
of revenue decreased 5.1% to $102.5 million in 2002 from $107.9 million in 2001.  Site development consulting cost of revenue increased 20.5% to $20.6 million for 2002 from $17.1 million for 2001, reflecting higher levels of activity and
increased personnel costs.  Site development construction cost of revenue decreased 9.9% to $81.9 million for 2002 from $90.8 million for 2001, due primarily to lower levels of activity.  Site leasing cost of revenue increased 35.2% to
$49.6 million for 2002 from $36.7 million for 2001, due to the increased number of towers owned resulting in an increased amount of lease payments to site owners and related site costs as well as increases in operating costs of sites in Puerto Rico,
maintenance and property taxes.

Gross profit increased to $112.6 million for 2002 from $98.2 million for 2001, due to increased site
leasing gross profit offset by a decrease in site development gross profit.  Gross profit from site development decreased 29.0% to $22.6 million in 2002 from $31.8 million in 2001 due to lower revenue and lower pricing without a commensurate
reduction in cost.  Gross profit margins for site development decreased in 2002 to 18.0% from 22.8% in 2001.  Gross profit margin on site development consulting decreased to 24.3% for 2002 from 29.5% for 2001. This decrease reflects
different stages of project completions and lower pricing for our services due to competition.  Gross profit margin on site development construction decreased to 16.3% for 2002 from 21.3% in 2001, resulting from lower pricing due to increased
competition.  We expect this pricing competition to continue and gross profit margin from site development to continue to be negatively impacted as we move through 2003. Gross profit for the site leasing business increased 35.5% to $90.0
million in 2002 from $66.4 million in 2001 and the gross profit margins on site leasing remained consistent at 64.4% during 2002 and 2001.  As a percentage of total revenues, gross profit increased to 42.5% of total revenues in 2002 from 40.4%
in 2001 due primarily to increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased 13.9% to $35.6 million for 2002 from $41.3 million for 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses, net of non-cash compensation expense, as a percentage of total revenue has also decreased to 12.7% for the year ended December 31,
2002 as compared to 15.7% for the year ended December 31, 2001.  The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense primarily resulted from a  decrease in tower developmental expenses as well as the reduction of offices,
elimination of personnel and elimination of other infrastructure that had previously been necessary to support our prior level of new asset growth but is no longer required as a result of the restructuring previously discussed.  Included within
selling, general and administrative expenses is a provision for doubtful accounts.  The provision for doubtful accounts increased to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001,
reflecting our assessment of a more challenging financial environment for our customers in 2002 and beyond.

Depreciation and
amortization increased to $102.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $80.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets (primarily towers) we owned in
2002 as compared to 2001, offset by a decrease in amortization resulting from the write-off of goodwill which was recorded in connection with the implementation of SFAS No. 142 previously



discussed.  Amortization of covenants not to compete in 2002 was $1.4 million (goodwill amortization was $0) compared to amortization of covenants not to compete and
goodwill in 2001 of $6.9 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2002 we incurred restructuring and other charges in the amount of
$77.6 million, consisting primarily of $63.7 million of restructuring charges and a $13.4 million goodwill impairment charge.  As a result of the continued deterioration of capital market conditions for wireless carriers, a $63.7 million
restructuring charge was recorded due to a reduction in the scale of our new tower construction activities and the impairment of certain tower assets held and used in operations. Of the $63.7 million charge, approximately $40.4 million related to
the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process and related construction materials on approximately 764 sites and $16.4 million related to the impairment of approximately 144 tower sites held and used in operations.  The
abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process resulted in the full write off of all costs incurred to date.  The impairment of operational tower assets resulted primarily from our evaluation of the current projected cash flow
and subsequent write-down to fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis.  Towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no current tenants and little or no prospects for future lease-up.  The remaining $6.9 million
of charge related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 470 employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately 40 offices.  Exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation
of offices primarily represented our estimate of future lease obligations after considering sublease opportunities.

Operating loss was
$(102.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to an operating loss of $(48.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  This increase in operating loss is a result of $77.6 million of restructuring and other charge
recorded in the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $24.4 recorded in the year ended December 31, 2001.  Total other expenses increased to $(89.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $(70.5) million for the year ended
December 31, 2001, primarily as a result of increased cash interest expense, increased non-cash amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance costs, and a reduction in interest income.  The increase in interest expense is primarily
due to higher principal amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility in 2002 as compared to 2001 and to a full quarter of interest expense on our $500.0 million 10¼ % senior notes in the first quarter of 2002 compared to a partial
quarter of interest expense on these senior notes in the first quarter of 2001.  Although the aggregate principal amount of total debt increased from the prior year, the resulting increase in interest expense associated with the higher
principal in 2002 was offset by the interest rate reduction we recognized in connection with our interest rate swap agreement.  As the interest rate swap agreement was terminated during October 2002, our aggregate amount of interest expense
would be expected to increase in future periods; excluding however, the impact of the AAT Transaction and the use of the proceeds to reduce our aggregate amount of outstanding indebtedness.  The increase in non-cash amortization is primarily
due to higher accretion on the 12% senior discount notes.  The decrease in interest income is due to lower cash balances during 2002.

During the period ended June 30, 2002, we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under SFAS 142, which was adopted effective January 1,
2002.  As a result of completing the required transitional test, we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of $80.6 million, representing the excess of the carrying
value of reporting units as compared to estimated fair value at January 1, 2002.  Of the total $80.6 million cumulative effect adjustment, $61.6 million related to the site development construction reporting segment and $19.0 million related to
the site leasing reporting segment.  The change modified the first quarter’s previously reported net loss of ($83.2) million, or ($1.70) per share, to ($163.8) million, or ($3.34) per share.

During 2002, we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately $13.4 million resulting from the achievement of certain earn-out obligations under various
construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2001.  In accordance with SFAS 142, in addition to the transitional test described above, goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually, or at any time that
indicators of impairment are present.  We determined, that as of June 30, 2002, indicators of impairment were present, thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed.  The indicators of impairment during the quarter ended June 30,
2002 giving rise to this analysis included significant deterioration of overall company market value, continued negative trends with respect to carrier capital expenditure plans, related demand for wireless construction and perceived reduction in
value of similar site development construction services business.  As a result of this analysis, using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value, $13.4 million of goodwill within the site development construction
reporting unit was determined to be impaired as of June 30, 2002.  The $13.4 million goodwill impairment charge is included within restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31,
2002.

Net loss was $(273.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to net loss of $(125.1) million for the year ended
December 31, 2001.  This increase in net loss is primarily a result of higher depreciation expense,



higher net interest expense, the $77.6 million restructuring and other charges previously discussed and the $80.6 million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
previously discussed offset by higher gross profit and lower selling, general and administrative expenses.  We expect to incur additional net losses in 2003.

Earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring expenses (“EBITDA”) increased 31.1% to
$79.0 million for the year ended 2002 from $60.2 million for the year ended 2001.  If the AAT Transaction is consummated, our EBITDA in 2003 would be reduced as a result of the sale of either 679 or 801 towers.  The following table
provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss available to common shareholders:

Year Ended 2001 Compared to Year Ended 2000

Total revenues increased 44.7% to $242.9 million for 2001 from $167.9 million for 2000. Total site development revenue increased 20.6% to $139.7 million in 2001 from
$115.9 million in 2000 due to an increase in site development construction revenue. Site development construction revenue increased 26.0% to $115.5 million for 2001 from $91.6 million for 2000, due primarily to revenues from companies acquired
during 2000 and 2001. Revenues of $34.3 million were contributed by these acquired entities in 2001. Our decision to reduce our level of new tower development activity may have a material adverse effect on our site development revenue in 2002 since,
as a result, we do not expect to perform equipment installation work for as many first tenants as we did in 2001. Site development consulting revenues were $24.3 million for 2001 and 2000. Site leasing revenue increased 98.3% to $103.2 million for
2001 from $52.0 million for 2000, due to tenants added to our towers and the substantially greater number of towers in our portfolio during 2001 as compared to 2000.

Total cost of revenues increased 33.5% to $144.7 million for 2001 from $108.4 million for 2000. Site development cost of revenue increased 21.4% to $107.9 million in
2001 from $88.9 million in 2000 due to higher site development revenues. Site development consulting cost of revenue increased 9.4% to $17.1 million for 2001 from $15.6 million for 2000, reflecting increased human resources costs. Site development
construction cost of revenue increased 24.0% to $90.8 million for 2001 from $73.3 million for 2000, due to higher site development construction revenues. Site leasing cost of revenue increased 88.3% to $36.7 million for 2001 from $19.5 million for
2000, due primarily to the increased number of towers owned.

Gross profit increased to $98.2 million for 2001 from $59.5 million for
2000, due to increased site development and site leasing revenues. Gross profit from site development increased 17.8% to $31.8 million in 2001 from $27.0 million in 2000 due to higher site development revenues. Gross profit margins for site
development decreased in 2001 to 22.8% from 23.3% in 2000 due to a greater relative amount of lower margin site development construction business. Gross profit margin on site development consulting decreased to 29.5% for 2001 from 35.6% for 2000.
This decrease is attributable to higher costs and our inability to timely reduce those costs as projects ended. Gross profit margin on site development construction increased slightly to 21.3% for 2001 from 20.1% in 2000.  Gross profit for the
site leasing business increased 104.3% to $66.4 million in 2001 from $32.5 million in 2000. The increased gross profit was due to the substantially greater number of towers owned and the greater average revenue per tower in the 2001 period. The
gross profit margins on site leasing increased to 64.4% for 2001 from 62.5% in 2000. The increase in gross margin was due to additional tenants added to our towers and the resulting increase in average revenue per tower, which was greater



than the increase in average expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, gross profit increased to 40.4% of total revenues in 2001 from 35.4% in 2000 due primarily to
increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 48.7% to $41.3
million for 2001 from $27.8 million for 2000. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses represents the addition of offices, personnel and other infrastructure necessary to support our growth, as well as increased developmental
expenses associated with our higher levels of new tower builds and acquisition activities and an increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2001. Included in selling, general and administrative expense is non-cash compensation expense of $3.3
million for 2001 and $0.3 million for 2000. The increase in 2001 is attributable primarily to the use of stock and options as payment for certain bonuses. As a percentage of total revenue, excluding non-cash compensation expenses, selling, general
and administrative expenses decreased to 15.7% for 2001 from 16.4% in 2000.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, we
recorded a $24.4 million charge relating to a reduction in the scale of our new tower construction operations. Approximately $24.1 million of this charge related to costs that were previously reflected in our balance sheet as
construction-in-process. The remaining $0.3 million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for 102 employees and the costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were primarily utilized in our new asset
development activities.

Depreciation and amortization increased to $80.5 million for 2001 as compared to $34.8 million for 2000. This
increase was directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets, primarily towers, we owned in 2001 as compared to 2000. As our fixed assets begin to mature we will be continuing to evaluate the useful lives of the assets and may decide to
change these useful lives based on the circumstances. If the useful lives of assets are reduced, depreciation may be accelerated in future years.  Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets during 2001 and 2000 was $6.9 million and
$3.6 million, respectively.

Operating loss increased to $(48.0) million for the year ended 2001 from $(3.1) million in 2000 as a result
of increased depreciation and the restructuring and other charge in 2001. Other expense, net, increased to $(70.5) million for the year ended 2001 from $(24.6) million for the year ended 2000. This increase is a result of an increase in
interest expense due to interest associated with the 10¼% senior notes as well as increases in other debt balances.

Earnings
(loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring expenses (“EBITDA”) increased 88.0% to $60.2 million for the year ended 2001 from $32.0 million for the year ended 2000. The following
table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss available to common shareholders:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SBA Communications Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of SBA
Telecommunications, which owns, directly or indirectly, the capital stock of our subsidiaries. We conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, other than financings, is
distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries. Even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we
cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend. Our ability to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures related to our 10¼% senior
notes and 12% senior discount notes.



As a result of these estimates and our expectations that we will not comply with one or more of the financial
covenants of our senior credit facility during 2003, the auditor’s opinion on our 2002 consolidated financial statements calls attention to substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern through 2003.

The issuance of this audit opinion with a “going-concern” qualification, if not remedied by April 30, 2003, would itself be
an event of default under our senior credit facility.  As part of our plan to address our anticipated non-compliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility commencing in 2003 and to reduce our significant level of
indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with AAT Communications to sell 679 towers or, if AAT Communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers, an
aggregate of 801 towers.  The AAT Transaction is subject to various conditions, including an amendment to our credit facility.  We anticipate that the amendment to our senior credit facility would, among other things, (1) waive any default
that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification, (2) modify the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and
beyond and (3) permit certain activities that are part of the AAT Transaction.  We believe that the AAT Transaction, in conjunction with the amendment to the senior credit facility, will upon consummation, eliminate the issues that gave rise to
the “going concern” qualification from our auditors.  Based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity, we believe that subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers, and the amendment to the senior credit
facility, we will have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow.

For a further discussion of our management’s
plans to address the issuance of our audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification and the possible defaults of certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility please refer to the section entitled “Going
Concern” above.

In addition to the proposed AAT Transaction, in order to manage our significant levels of indebtedness and
to insure continued compliance with our financial covenants, we are exploring a number of alternatives, including selling certain assets or lines of business, issuing equity, repurchasing, restructuring or refinancing or exchanging for equity some
or all of our debt or pursuing other financial alternatives, and we may from time to time implement one or more of these alternatives.  One or more of the alternatives may include the possibility of issuing additional shares of common stock or
securities convertible into shares of common stock or converting our existing indebtedness into shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, any of which would dilute our existing shareholders.  We cannot assure
you that either the AAT Transaction and/or any other of these strategies can be consummated, or if consummated, would effectively address our liquidity concerns, the possible defaults under our debt instruments or any of the other risks associated
with our significant level of indebtedness.

Net cash provided by operations during the year ended December 31, 2002 was $1.6 million as
compared to $13.0 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to cash interest payments made in February and August 2002 on the 10¼% senior notes.  Net cash used in investing activities for year the ended December 31, 2002
was $98.0 million compared to $530.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to a significantly lower level of tower acquisitions and new build activity in 2002 versus 2001.  Net cash provided by
financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $143.7 million compared to $516.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2002 was primarily due to the issuance of our
$500.0 million 10¼% senior notes completed in February 2001.

Our cash capital expenditures for the year ended December
31, 2002 were $103.4 million as compared to $530.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  This decrease is a result of lower investment in new tower assets.   We currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during
the year ending December 31, 2003 of $10.0 million to $15.0 million. All of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flow from operations.  The exact amount of our future capital expenditures will
depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio and to complete pending build-to-suit obligations.

Our balance sheet reflected negative working capital of $(149.0) million and $(19.4) million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  This change is
attributable to the classification of $189.4 million of previously long-term debt as current, based upon management’s requirement to repay in 2003 substantially all of the net proceeds from the AAT Transaction in the amount of $188.0 million,
offset by higher cash balances, receipts of accounts receivable and lower accounts payable levels.

At December 31,
2002 we had $500.0 million outstanding on our 10¼% senior notes. The 10¼% senior notes mature February 1, 2009.  Interest on these notes is payable February 1 and August 1 of each year.  Additionally, at December 31, 2002, we had
$263.9 million outstanding on our 12% senior discount notes, net of unamortized original issue discount of $5.1 million. The 12% senior discount notes mature on March 1, 2008.  The 12% senior



discount notes accreted in value until March 1, 2003.  Thereafter interest will begin to accrue and will be payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on
September 1, 2003.   Each of the 10¼% senior notes and the 12% senior discount notes are unsecured and are

pari passu

in right of payment with our other existing and future senior indebtedness.  The 10¼% senior notes
and the 12% senior discount notes place certain restrictions on, among other things, the incurrence of debt and liens, issuance of preferred stock, payment of dividends or other distributions, sale of assets, transactions with affiliates, sale and
leaseback transactions, certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other entities.

In June 2001, SBA
Telecommunications, our principal subsidiary, entered into a $300.0 million senior secured credit facility.  This facility was amended in January 2002 and further amended in August 2002.  The senior credit facility as amended, provides for
a $100.0 million term loan and a $200.0 million revolving loan, the availability of which is based on compliance with certain covenants.  As of December 31, 2002, SBA Telecommunications had $255.0 million in loans outstanding under this
facility, $100.0 million of the term loan and $155.0 million of the revolver.  In addition, as of December 31, 2002, $14.5 million of letters of credit were issued and outstanding, under the senior credit facility.  The term loan and the
revolving loan mature June 15, 2007 and repayment of the term loan begins in September 2003 ($2.5 million is due for repayment on each of September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003).  Under the current terms of the senior credit facility, we are
required to use substantially all of the net proceeds of asset sales to repay outstanding debt under the senior credit facility.  As a result, we have calculated our current debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 to include substantially all of
the net proceeds from the proposed sale of 801 towers to AAT Communications of $188.0 million.  However, we intend to seek an amendment to the senior credit facility and in exchange for certain modifications, we would repay approximately $150.0
million of this facility in 2003.  The receipt of this amendment is a condition to the consummation of the AAT Transaction.  Borrowings under the senior credit facility accrue interest at the Euro dollar rate plus a margin or a base rate
plus a margin, as defined in the credit agreement.  At December 31, 2002, $100.0 million term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility was at variable rates of 3.41% to 3.43% and $155.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit
facility was at variable rates of 3.41% to 3.81%.

The senior credit facility requires SBA Telecommunications to maintain
specified financial ratios, including ratios regarding our consolidated debt coverage, debt service, cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and to satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining minimum consolidated
EBITDA.  The senior credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, require us to submit audited financial statements without a “going-concern” qualification in the audit opinion and
restricts our ability to incur debt and liens, sell assets, commit to capital expenditures, enter into affiliate transactions or sale-leaseback transactions, and/or build towers without anchor tenants.  The August 2002 amendment adjusted
certain covenants and financial covenants, but did not change the amount or repayment terms of the facility.  Specifically, the August 2002 amendment (1) amended certain financial covenants to (a) decrease the required ratios for cash interest
expense coverage, fixed charges coverage and debt service coverage in 2003 to 2005 and (b) reduce the permitted senior leverage and debt per tower ratios and (2) increased the interest margin over the Euro dollar rate as specified in the original
agreement by 25 basis points.  Availability under the senior credit facility is contingent upon compliance with the financial ratios and tests and other covenants in the credit agreement.  As of December 31, 2002 we were in full compliance
with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility; however, the issuance of the audit opinion on the 2002 financial statements with a “going-concern” qualification, if not remedied by April 30, 2003, would be an event of default
which would permit the lenders, by a majority vote, to immediately accelerate the maturity of the principal and interest outstanding under the senior credit facility and to terminate our ability to access any remaining available funds.  Our
ability in the future to comply with the covenants and access the available funds under the senior credit facility in the future will depend on our future financial performance.  The senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of the
assets of SBA Telecommunications and its subsidiaries.

One of our goals is the attainment of sustained positive free cash
flow

(1)

.  We define free cash flow as EBITDA less net cash interest, cash capital expenditures and cash taxes.  We are focused on maintaining sufficient liquidity until we reach our goal of sustained positive free cash
flow.  Based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity, we believe that subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers, and the amendment to the senior credit facility, we will have sufficient liquidity to achieve
positive free cash flow.

(1)

Free cash flow is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor has it
been presented as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

We have on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) shelf
registration statements on Form S-4 registering up to a total of 8.0 million shares of Class A common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services at various
locations in the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we issued 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock under



these registration statements in connection with one acquisition and certain earn-outs. As of December 31, 2002, we had 4.4 million shares of Class A common stock remaining
available under these shelf registration statements.

We have on file with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement registering
the sale of up to $252.7 million of any combination of the following securities: Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares or warrants.

INFLATION

The impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. However, we cannot assure you that a high rate of
inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results.

EFFECT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.

This standard requires companies to record the fair value of
a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred.  When the liability is initially recorded, the cost is to be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.  Over time,
the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.  Upon settlement of the liability, we either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a
gain or loss upon settlement.  We are required to adopt this standard effective January 1, 2003.  We have not completed our analysis determining the effect adoption of SFAS 143 will have on our consolidated financial statements, but
believe it may be material given that we have obligations to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of ground leases underlying a majority of our towers.  We will record the cumulative effect of adopting this statement
effective January 1, 2003.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,

Rescission of FASB Statements Nos. 4, 44 and 62, Amendment of
SFAS No. 13 and Technical Corrections

.  For most companies, SFAS 145 will require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously
required under SFAS 4.  Extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in APB Opinion No. 30.  The statement also amended SFAS 13 for certain sale-leasebacks and sublease accounting.  We are required
to adopt the provisions of SFAS 145 effective January 1, 2003.  Pursuant to SFAS 145, our previously reported extraordinary item will be reclassified to operating expense in consolidated financial statement presentation subsequent to December
31, 2002.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

and
nullified EITF Issue No. 94–3.  SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, whereas EITF No. 94–3 had recognized the liability at the
commitment date to an exit plan.  SFAS 146 requires that the initial measurement of a liability be at fair value.  We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 146 effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31,
2002.  The effect of adopting SFAS 146 is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure

.  SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation.  This statement also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.  The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002.  We will continue to account for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No.
25.  As such, we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 148 as of December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued.  FIN 45 also clarifies requirements for the recognition of guarantees at the onset of an arrangement.  The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002.  The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for interim or annual financial statements after December 15, 2002.   We implemented the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 as of December 31, 2002
and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of this implementation.



In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46,

Consideration for Variable Interest
Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51

which requires all variable interest entities (“VIEs”) to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary  is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial
interest in the VIE.  In addition, the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as VIEs from which the entity is a holder of a significant amount of beneficial
interests, but not the majority.  FIN 46 is effective for all VIEs created or acquired after January 31, 2003.  For VIEs created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or
annual period beginning after June 15, 2003.  We do not expect the effect of adopting FIN 46 to be material to the consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations.
The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
with no need for management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks
related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results.
For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, beginning on page F-10. Note that our preparation of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.

Revenue
Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the related lease agreements. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenues.

Site development projects
in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in
which we perform work on a fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, we recognize
the revenue related to that phase. Revenue related to services performed on uncompleted phases of site development projects was not recorded by us at the end of the reporting periods presented as it was not material to our results of operations. Any
estimated losses on a particular phase of completion are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident. Site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared
to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the
uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues
recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.

Cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor,
vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects. All costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred. Cost of site leasing revenue include rent, maintenance (exclusive of employee
related costs) and other tower expenses. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated
credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified.



Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are
recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease.
We perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be
rendered by the asset, industry practice and asset maintenance policies. Maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred.

Asset
classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows:

Towers and related components

2 – 15 years

Furniture, equipment and vehicles

2 –   7 years

Buildings and improvements

5 – 39 years

Capitalized costs incurred subsequent to when an asset is originally placed in service are depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective
asset. Changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively, with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life term.

We evaluate the potential impairment of individual long-lived assets, principally the tower sites.  We record an impairment charge when we believe an investment
in towers has been impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site.  We consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment,
including but not limited to general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential, and expected timing of lease-up.  Future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or
an inability to recover the carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.  In addition, if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect, a future impairment
charge may be required.

The restructuring and other charges of $ 77.6 million recorded in 2002 includes a $16.4 million asset impairment
charge. The asset impairment charge was determined through an evaluation of our tower asset portfolio using a projected cash flow analysis and assets were written down to fair value determined on a discounted cash flow analysis.  The tower
assets determined to be impaired were primarily those with no current tenants and little or no lease-up potential.  Long-lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment any time that indicators of impairment are present.  If wireless
carrier capital expenditures and their ability to access capital remain weak or deteriorate further, we believe the valuation of certain of our long-lived assets may be negatively impacted.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. SFAS 144 supercedes SFAS No. 121,

Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed of

.  SFAS 144 applies to all long-lived assets (including discontinued operations) and consequently amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30

,
Reporting Results of Operations – Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business

.  SFAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.  We adopted SFAS 144 on
January 1, 2002.



Goodwill

During 2002, we completed the transitional
impairment test of goodwill required under SFAS 142, which was adopted effective January 1, 2002.  As a result of completing the required transitional test, we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of the
accounting change in the amount of $80.6 million, representing the excess of the carrying value of reporting units as compared to their estimated fair value.  Of the total $80.6 million cumulative effect adjustment, $61.6 million related to the
site development construction reporting segment and $19.0 million related to the site leasing reporting segment.  The change modified the first quarter’s previously reported net loss of ($83.2) million, or ($1.70) per share to ($163.8)
million, or ($3.34) per share.

During 2002, we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately $13.4 million resulting from the
achievement of certain earn-out obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2001.  In accordance with SFAS 142, in addition to the transitional test described above, goodwill is subject to an
impairment assessment at least annually, or at any time that indicators of impairment are present.  We determined that as of June 30, 2002 indicators of impairment were present, thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed.  The
indicators of impairment during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 giving rise to this analysis included significant further deterioration of company value, further activities under our restructuring plan, and market conditions related to demand for
wireless construction services.  As a result of this analysis, using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value, $13.4 million of goodwill within the site development construction segment was determined to be impaired as
of June 30, 2002.  The $13.4 million goodwill impairment charge is included within restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.  As of December 31, 2002 we did not have
any remaining goodwill or other intangible assets subject to SFAS 142.

Restructuring Accruals

In establishing the accrual for the restructuring costs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, we made certain assumptions to estimate future
severance costs and other exit costs.  In addition, while performing impairment tests for certain long-term assets, assumptions were made as to the future cash flows associated with these assets.  While we feel the assumptions were
appropriate, there can be no assurance that actual costs will not differ from estimates used to establish the restructuring accrual.  If actual results differ from the estimates, we may need to adjust, upward or downward, our restructuring
accrual in the future.

Accounting for Income Taxes

As part of the process
of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary
differences resulting from differing treatment of items, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood
that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.  To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this
allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations.

Significant management
judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $136.2 million as of
December 31, 2002, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating losses.  The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over
which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our
financial position and results of operations. The net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2002 was $18.4 million.

Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These instruments arise
from transactions entered into in the normal course of business, and in some cases relate to our acquisition of related businesses.  We are subject to interest rate risk on our senior credit facility and any future financing requirements. 
Substantially of our indebtedness currently consists of fixed rate debt.



The following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates
associated with our long-term debt instruments, assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of December 31, 2002:

In January 2002, we entered into an
interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. The notional principal amount
of the interest rate swap was $100.0 million. The maturity date of the interest rate swap matched the principal maturity date of the 10¼% senior notes, the underlying debt (February 2009). This swap involved the exchange of fixed rate payments
for variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount. The variable rates were based on six-month EURO rate plus 4.47% and were reset on a semi-annual basis.  The counter-party to the interest rate swap agreement
elected to terminate the swap agreement effective October 15, 2002.  In connection with this termination, the counter-party paid us $6.2 million, which included approximately $0.8 million in accrued interest.  The remaining $5.4 million
received was deferred and is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes using the effective interest method.  The deferred gain balance of $5.2 million at December 31, 2002 is included in
long-term debt.

Our primary market risk exposure relates to (1) the interest rate risk on variable-rate long-term and short-term
borrowings, (2) our ability to refinance our 10¼% senior notes and our 12% senior discount notes, at maturity at market rates, and (3) the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet financial covenants.  We manage the
interest rate risk on our outstanding long-term and short-term debt through our use of fixed and variable rate debt.  While we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on
our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis.

Senior Discount Note Disclosure Requirements

The indentures governing our 10¼% senior notes and our 12% senior discount notes require certain financial disclosures for restricted subsidiaries separate from
unrestricted subsidiaries and the disclosure to be made of Tower Cash Flow, as defined in the indentures, for the most recent fiscal quarter and Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow, as defined in the indentures, for the most recently completed
four-quarter period. As of December 31, 2002 we had no unrestricted subsidiaries. Tower Cash Flow, as defined in the indentures, for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 was $18.9 million. Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow for the year ended December
31, 2002 was $82.2 million.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS


F-1


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The Board of Directors

SBA Communications Corporation and
Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended.  Our audit also included the 2002 financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). 
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audit.  The consolidated financial statements
of the Company as of December 31, 2001 and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001, and the financial statement schedule for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 listed in the Index at Item 15(a), were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations and whose report dated February 22, 2002, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements and schedule.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 2002 financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of SBA
Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.  Also, in our opinion, the related 2002 financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the 2002 basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries will continue as
a going concern.  As more fully described in Note 2, it is likely that the Company will not remain in compliance with certain covenants of its credit agreement during the year ended December 31, 2003.  The Company will need to obtain a
waiver in order for its credit agreement not to be considered in default.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also
described in Note 2.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, the Company
changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets.

As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of
SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 5, these financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit
procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note 5 with respect to 2001 and 2000 included (a) agreeing the previously reported net loss to the previously issued financial statements and the adjustments to reported net loss representing
amortization expense recognized in those periods related to goodwill, to the Company’s underlying records obtained from management, and (b) testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net loss to reported net loss, and
the related loss-per-share amounts. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in Note 5 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements of the
Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To SBA Communications Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation (a Florida corporation) and subsidiaries as of December
31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SBA Communications Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

THIS IS A COPY OF THE AUDIT REPORT PREVIOUSLY ISSUED BY ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP IN CONNECTION
WITH SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION’S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001.  THIS AUDIT REPORT HAS NOT BEEN REISSUED BY ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP IN CONNECTION WITH THIS FILING ON FORM 10-K.

WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP AS REQUIRED BY SECTION 7 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 FOR ANY REGISTRATION STATEMENT WE MAY FILE IN THE FUTURE.  ACCORDINGLY, INVESTORS
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUE ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP PURSUANT TO SECTION 11(A) (4) OF THE SECURITIES ACT WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH REGISTRATION STATEMENTS AND, THEREFORE, ULTIMATE RECOVERY FROM ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP MAY ALSO BE LIMITED AS A RESULT OF

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.       GENERAL

SBA Communications Corporation (the
“Company” or “SBA”) was incorporated in the State of Florida in March, 1997. The Company holds all of the outstanding capital stock of SBA Telecommunications (“SBA Telecommunications”).  SBA Telecommunications
holds all of the capital stock of SBA Network Services, Inc. (“Network Services”), SBA Leasing, Inc., (“Leasing”), SBA Towers, Inc., SBA Properties, Inc., SBA Sites, Inc., and certain other tower companies (collectively
“Tower Companies”). Network Services holds all of the capital stock of other companies engaged in similar businesses.

Network
Services provides comprehensive turnkey services for the telecommunications industry in the areas of site development services for wireless carriers and the construction and repair of transmission towers. Site development services provided by
Network Services include network pre-design, site audits, site identification and acquisition, contract and title administration, zoning and land use permitting, construction management, microwave relocation and the construction and repair of
transmission towers, including the hanging of antennae, cabling and associated tower components. In addition to providing turnkey services to the telecommunications industry, Network Services historically has constructed many of the newly-built
towers that the Company owns.

The Tower Companies own and operate transmission towers in various parts of the United States, Puerto
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Space on these towers is leased primarily to wireless communications carriers.

Leasing leases
antenna tower sites from owners and then subleases such sites to wireless telecommunications providers.

2.       LIQUIDITY AND MANAGEMENT’S
PLANS

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has significant borrowings under the senior credit facility, the 10 ¼% senior notes and the 12% senior discount notes, each containing
certain covenants.  Among other things, these covenants restrict the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell assets for less than fair market value, pay dividends, redeem outstanding debt or engage in other restricted
payments.  If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments.   The senior credit facility requires SBA Telecommunications to maintain specified
financial ratios, including ratios regarding SBA Telecommunications’ consolidated debt coverage, debt service, cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining a
minimum consolidated EBITDA (earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring expenses). The Company is in full compliance with all of the financial ratios and tests as of December 31,
2002.  Based on declines that the Company has been experiencing in its site development business and that it believes will continue in 2003, the Company estimated that it would not be in compliance with one or more of the senior credit
facility’s existing financial ratios or tests in 2003.

As a result of these estimates and the Company’s expectations that it
will not comply with one or more of the financial covenants of the senior credit facility during 2003, the auditor’s opinion on the Company’s 2002 consolidated financial statements calls attention to substantial doubts about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through 2003.

The issuance of this audit opinion with a “going
concern” qualification, if not remedied by April 30, 2003, would be an event of default under the senior credit facility.  Upon the occurrence of this, or any other event of default, the lenders can prevent the Company from borrowing any
additional amounts under the senior credit facility.  In addition, upon the occurrence of any event of default, other than certain bankruptcy events, the senior credit facility lenders, by a majority vote, can elect to declare all amounts of
principal outstanding under the senior credit facility, together with all accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.  The acceleration of amounts due under the senior credit facility would cause a cross-default under the indentures
governing the 10¼% senior notes and the 12% senior discount notes, thereby permitting the acceleration of such indebtedness.  If the indebtedness under the senior credit facility and/or indebtedness under the 10¼% senior notes or 12%
senior discount notes were to be accelerated, the current assets of the Company would not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness.  If the Company was unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior credit facility, its lenders
could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.  Substantially all of the Company’s assets are pledged as security under the senior credit facility.

F-9


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)

As part of the Company’s plan to addresss its anticipated non-compliance with certain financial covenants
under its senior credit facility commencing in 2003 and to reduce its significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with AAT
Communications to sell 679 towers or, if AAT Communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers, an aggregate of  801 towers (see Note 20).  The Company is also currently exploring, and may from time to time take advantage of,
various strategic opportunities including, but not limited to, the sale of certain assets or lines of business, the issuance of equity or the repurchasing, restructuring, or refinancing of  some or all of its debt.  The Company believes
that the AAT Transaction, in conjunction with the amendment to the senior credit facility, will upon consummation, eliminate the issues that gave rise to the “going concern” qualification from its auditors with respect to its 2002
consolidated financial statements.  Furthermore, based on its current estimates, subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers, and the anticipated amendment to the senior credit facility, the Company expects to have sufficient
liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow.  However, the Company cannot assure you that either the AAT Transaction and/or any other plan or action can be consummated, or if consummated, would effectively address its liquidity concerns, the
possible defaults under its debt instruments or any of the other risks associated with its significant level of indebtedness.

Based on
its previous experience with its lender syndicate for its senior credit facility, the Company believes that it will be able to successfully negotiate with its present senior credit bank syndicate, an amendment to its senior credit facility that,
among other things, (1) waives any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification, (2) modifies the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing
business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and (3) permits certain actions that are part of the AAT Transaction.  This would thereby permit the Company to prevent the occurrence of any event of default or the acceleration of its
indebtedness.  However, the Company’s prior ability to obtain necessary waivers and/or amendments does not insure its ability to obtain these waivers and/or amendments, especially in light of the recent financial performance of the
wireless telecommunications industry and the Company.

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from this uncertainty.

3.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the
significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as follows:

a.       Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

b.       Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. The more significant estimates made by management include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, the costs and revenue relating to the Company’s site development and construction contracts, valuation
allowance on deferred tax assets, carrying value of long-lived assets, and the economic useful lives of towers. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

c.       Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company classifies as cash and cash equivalents all interest-bearing deposits or investments with original maturities of three months or less, and highly liquid
short-term commercial paper.

F-10


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)

d.       Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.  Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease.  The Company performs ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment for
depreciation purposes.  The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset.  Maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred.

Asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows:

Towers and related components

2 –15 years

Furniture, equipment and vehicles

2 –  7 years

Buildings and improvements

5 –39 years

Capitalized costs incurred subsequent to when an asset is originally placed in service are depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective
asset. Changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively, with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life. There has been no material impact for
changes in estimated useful lives for any years presented.

Interest is capitalized in connection with the self-construction of Company
owned towers. The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Approximately $1.7 million and $3.5 million of interest cost was capitalized in 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

e.       Deferred Financing Fees

Financing fees related to the issuance of the senior credit facility, the 10¼% senior notes, the 12% senior discount notes, and the related original issue
discount on the 12% senior discount notes, have been deferred and are being amortized using a method that approximates the effective interest rate method over the length of indebtedness to which they relate.

f.       Deferred Lease Costs

The Company defers certain initial direct costs associated with lease originations and lease amendments and amortizes these costs over the initial lease term,
generally five years. Total costs deferred were approximately $2.2 million and $1.9 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Amortization expense was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, and is included in cost of site leasing in the
accompanying 2002 Consolidated Statement of Operations.  As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, unamortized deferred lease costs were $4.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively, and are included in other assets. Accumulated amortization totaled
$2.0 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

g.       Intangible
Assets

Intangible assets are comprised of costs paid related to covenants not to compete.  These finite-lived intangibles are
being amortized over the terms of the contracts, which range from 3 to 10 years.  Amortization expense was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.  As of December 31, 2002, covenants not to compete totaled $7.6 million and
accumulated amortization totaled $3.3 million.

h.       Goodwill

Goodwill at December 31, 2001, is comprised of costs paid in excess of the fair value of assets acquired.  There was no goodwill at December 31, 2002 or
amortization of goodwill during 2002, as a result of adopting the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”) in 2002.  During 2001,
goodwill was being amortized over periods that ranged from 7 to 40 years.

i.       Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS 144, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable.  If an asset is

F-11


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)

determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future
cash flows.  Estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not limited to, general market conditions, historical operating results, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up.

In early 2002, certain tower sites held and used in operations were considered to be impaired.  Towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers
with no current tenants and little or no prospects for future lease-up.  An impairment charge of approximately $16.4 million was recorded to restructuring and other charges during 2002.

Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management has approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, and the assets are available for
disposal.

j.       Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, which primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts
payable, accrued expenses and notes payable, approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s 12% senior discount notes are publicly traded and were trading based on a 28.5% yield at December 31, 2002,
indicating a fair value of approximately $145.2 million as compared to a carrying value of approximately $263.9 million. The Company’s 10¼% senior notes are publicly traded and were trading based on a 25.0% yield at December 31, 2002,
indicating a fair value of approximately $275.0 million as compared to a carrying value of $500.0 million.

At December 31, 2001, the
Company’s 12% senior discount notes were trading based on a 14.4% yield, indicating a fair value of approximately $209.8 million as compared to a carrying value of $234.9 million and the Company’s 10¼% senior notes were trading based
on a 13.1% yield, indicating a fair value of approximately $435.0 million as compared to a carrying value of $500.0 million.

k.       Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease agreements. Rental amounts received in
advance are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets.

Site development projects in which the Company
performs consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which the
Company performs work on a fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, the Company
recognizes the revenue related to that phase. Revenue related to services performed on uncompleted phases of site development projects was not recorded by the Company at the end of the reporting periods presented as it was not material to the
Company’s results of operations. Any estimated losses on a particular phase of completion are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident. Site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to
date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the
uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues
recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.  Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted
contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

Cost of site development project revenue and
construction revenue include all material costs, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects.  All costs related to site development projects and
construction projects are recognized as incurred. Cost of site leasing revenue includes rent, property taxes, maintenance (exclusive of employee related costs) and other tower expenses.

F-12


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers.  The Company continuously monitors
collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon  historical experience and specific customer collection issues identified.  If the capital markets and the ability of wireless
carriers to access capital remains weak or further deteriorates, the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable may be negatively impacted.

l.       Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses represent those costs incurred which are related to the administration or management of the Company. Also, included in
this category are corporate development expenses incurred in the normal course of business that represented costs incurred in connection with proposed acquisitions which have not been consummated, new build activities where a capital asset is not
produced, and expansion of the customer base. The above costs are expensed as incurred.  Development expenses included in selling, general and administrative were $4.2 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.  There were no recurring development expenses in 2002.

m.       Income
Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

SFAS 109 requires the Company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities
and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in the years in which the temporary differences are
expected to reverse. In assessing the likelihood of utilization of existing deferred tax assets, management has considered historical results of operations and the current operating environment.

n.       Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure – an amendment of SFAS 123, which
provides alternative methods for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123.  The Company has elected to continue to account for its
stock-based employee compensation plans under APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.  The following disclosures are provided in accordance with SFAS 148.

The Company has various stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.  The company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations.  From time to time, options to purchase Class
A common stock have been granted under the Company’s 1999 Equity Participation Plan and the 2001 Equity Participation Plan which were below market value at the time of the grant.  The Company recorded non-cash compensation expense of $2.0
million, $3.3 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Except for the amount on non-cash compensation recognized, no other stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income,
as all other options granted the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used with the following assumptions:

The following table illustrates the effect
on net loss and loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.

o.       Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2002 presentation.

p.       Loss Per Share

Basic and diluted loss per share are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per Share

. The Company has potential common stock equivalents related
to its outstanding stock options. These potential common stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share and the weighted average
number of shares used in the computations are the same for all periods presented. There were 2.8 million, 3.8 million and 3.1 million options outstanding at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The computation of basic and fully diluted
loss per share is as follows:

F-13


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)

q.       Comprehensive Income (Loss)

During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company did not have any changes in its equity resulting from non-owner sources and accordingly,
comprehensive income (loss) was equal to the net loss amounts presented for the respective periods in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

4.       CURRENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 142.  This standard eliminated the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets against earnings. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. Goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be written-down against earnings only in the periods in which the recorded value of the asset is more than its fair value.  SFAS 142 required the Company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment
test within six months from the date of adoption.  The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002 and completed the required transitional tests prior to June 30, 2002.  In addition, the Company performed an
impairment assessment of goodwill as of June 30, 2002.  Other intangibles will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally 3 to 15 years.  See Note 5 for further discussion regarding the implementation of SFAS
142.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(“SFAS
143”).

This standard requires companies to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred.  When the liability is initially recorded, the Company
capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.  Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset.  Upon settlement of the liability, the Company either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.  The standard will be adopted effective January 1, 2003.  Management has not
completed its analysis as to the effect adoption of SFAS 143 will have on the consolidated financial statements, but believes it may be material given the Company’s obligations to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination
of ground leases underlying a majority of the Company’s towers.  The Company will record the cumulative effect of adopting this Statement as of January 1, 2003.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (“

SFAS 144

”).

SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed of (“

SFAS 121

”).

This Statement supersedes SFAS 121, however it retains the fundamental
provisions of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets to be “held and used.”  In addition, the Statement provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a
recoverability test, requires that a long-lived asset (group) to be disposed of other than by sales (e.g. abandoned) be classified as “held and used” until it is disposed of, and establishes more

F-14


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)

restrictive criteria to classify an asset (group) as “held for sale.”  The Statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of APB 30 for
the disposal of a segment of a business and would extend the reporting of a discontinued operation to a “component of an entity” increasing the likelihood that a disposition will represent a discontinued operation.  Further, the
Statement requires operating losses from a “component of an entity” to be recognized in the period(s) in which they occur (rather than as of the measurement date as previously required by APB 30).  The adoption of SFAS 144 did not
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,

Rescission of FASB
Statements Nos. 4, 44 and 62, Amendment of SFAS No. 13 and Technical Corrections

(“SFAS 145”).  For most companies, SFAS 145 will require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from
continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under SFAS 4.  Extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in APB Opinion No. 30.  The statement also amended SFAS 13 for
certain sales-leaseback and sublease accounting.  The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 145 effective January 1, 2003.  Pursuant to SFAS 145, the Company’s previously reported extraordinary item will be reclassified
to operating expense in consolidated financial statement presentation subsequent to December 31, 2002.

In July 2002, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

(“SFAS 146”) and nullified EITF Issue No. 94–3.  SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, whereas EITF No. 94–3 had required recognition of the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan.  SFAS 146 requires that the initial measurement of a liability be at fair
value.  The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 146 effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.  The effect of adopting SFAS 146 is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial
statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and
Disclosure

(“SFAS 148”).

SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  This statement also amends
the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.  The
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002.   The Company will continue to account for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25.  As such, the Company does not expect this standard to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.  The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 148 as of December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45’),

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.  FIN
45 also clarifies requirements for the recognition of guarantees at the onset of an arrangement.  The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December
31, 2002.  The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for interim or annual financial statements after December 15, 2002.   The Company implemented the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 as of December 31, 2002 and there was
no material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this implementation.

In January 2003, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation for Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

which requires all variable interest entities (“VIEs”) to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary
is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interest in the VIE.  In addition, the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as VIEs from which the entity is
the holder of a significant amount of beneficial interests, but not the majority.  FIN 46 is effective for all VIEs created or acquired after January 31, 2003.  For VIEs created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN
46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003.  The Company does not expect the effect of adopting this FIN will be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

5.       GOODWILL AND CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

During 2002, the Company completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under SFAS 142, which was adopted effective January 1, 2002.  As a
result of completing the required transitional test, the Company recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of $80.6 million, representing the excess of the carrying value of
reporting units as compared to their estimated fair value.  Of the total $80.6 million cumulative effect adjustment, $61.6 million related to the site development construction reporting segment and $19.0 million related to the site leasing
reporting segment.

During 2002, the Company recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately $13.4 million resulting from the
achievement of certain earn-out obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2001.  In accordance with SFAS 142, in addition to the transitional test described above, goodwill is subject to an
impairment assessment at least annually, or at any time that indicators of impairment are present.  The Company determined that during 2002 indicators of impairment were present, thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed.  The
indicators of impairment giving rise to this analysis included significant deterioration of overall company value, continued negative trends with respect to carrier capital expenditure plans and related demand for wireless construction services, and
perceived reduction in value of similar site development construction services businesses.  As a result of this analysis, using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value, $13.4 million of goodwill within the site
development construction reporting segment was determined to be impaired.  The $13.4 million goodwill impairment charge is included within restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December
31, 2002.

The following unaudited pro forma summary presents the Company’s net loss and per share information as if the
Company had been accounting for its goodwill under SFAS 142 for all periods presented:

Amortization expense was $1.4
million, $6.9 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.  Estimated amortization expense on the Company’s covenants not to compete for the next five calendar years and thereafter is as
follows:

6.       ACQUISITIONS

During 2002, the Company acquired 53 towers and related assets from various sellers.  The aggregate consideration paid was $15.5 million in cash and 330,736
shares of Class A common stock. In addition, the Company issued 397,773 shares of Class A Common Stock in settlement of contingent purchase price amounts payable as a result of towers or businesses it previously acquired having met or exceeded
certain earnings or new tower targets.  The 397,773 shares issued excludes the shares issued to Atlantic Telecom Services discussed below.

During 2001, the Company purchased two site development construction companies. On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of
Atlantic Telecom Services, Inc. (“Atlantic Telecom”). The Company paid $2.4 million in cash and issued 213,524 shares of its Class A common stock to the shareholders of Atlantic Telecom.  During the first quarter of 2002, the
shareholders received 587,260 shares as a result of certain 2001 earnings targets being met.  In addition, as of December 31, 2002, the former shareholders of Atlantic Telecom were entitled to receive an additional $2.0 million as a result of
certain 2002 earnings targets being met.  Therefore, the Company has accrued $2.0 million within other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2002.  The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
value of the net assets acquired, or approximately $9.7 million was recorded as goodwill, which was being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.  The $9.7 million in goodwill plus the $2.0 million in goodwill that was
recorded as a result of the earn-out targets having been met, were written off during 2002 in connection with the implementation of SFAS 142.  (See Note 5).  Subsequent to December 31, 2002, this $2.0 million was paid in cash by the
Company.

On June 1, 2001, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Total
Tower Service, Inc. (“Total Tower”). The Company paid $12.1 million in cash and issued 200,107 shares of its Class A common stock to the shareholders of Total Tower.  The former shareholders of Total Tower were paid $7.0 million
during 2002 as a result of meeting certain net income targets during the first year after the closing date. The excess of the original purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, or approximately $10.1 million was
recorded as goodwill, which was being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.  The $10.1 million in goodwill plus the $7.0 million in goodwill that was recorded as a result of the earn-out payment, were written off during
2002 in connection with the implementation of SFAS 142 (see Note 5).

Additionally, during 2001, the Company acquired 677 towers and
related assets from various sellers. The aggregate consideration paid to sellers for these acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $214.4 million in cash and 370,502 shares of its Class A common stock. In addition, the Company issued
790,495 shares of its Class A Common Stock as a result of towers or businesses it acquired having met or exceeded certain earnings or new tower targets identified in the various acquisition agreements.

The Company accounted for all the above acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired assets and companies are
included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. None of the individual acquisitions consummated were deemed significant to the Company and accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented. 
The acquisitions were paid for from the issuance of Class A common stock, proceeds from debt offerings, cash provided from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the senior credit facility.

10¼% Senior Notes

In February 2001, the Company issued $500.0 million of its 10¼% senior notes due 2009, which produced net proceeds of approximately $484.3 million after
deducting offering expenses. Interest accrues on the notes and is  payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing August 1, 2001. Proceeds from the senior notes were used to acquire and construct
telecommunications towers, repay borrowings under the senior credit facility, and for general working capital purposes. Approximately $105.6 million of the proceeds were used to repay all borrowing under the senior credit facility, and the senior
credit agreement in existence at the time it was terminated.   The Company wrote off the deferred financing fees relating to the senior credit facility and recorded a $5.1 million extraordinary loss in the first quarter of 2001 in
connection with the termination of this facility.

The 10¼% senior notes are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment with
the Company’s other existing and future senior indebtedness.  The 10¼% senior notes place certain restrictions on, among other things, the incurrence of debt and liens, issuance of preferred stock, payment of dividends or other
distributions, sales of assets, transaction with affiliates, sale and leaseback transactions, certain investments and the Company’s ability to merge or consolidate with other entities.  The ability of the Company to comply with the
covenants and other terms of the 10¼% senior notes and to satisfy its respective debt obligations will depend on the future operating performance of the Company.  In the event the Company fails to comply with the various covenants
contained in the 10¼% senior notes, it would be in default thereunder, and in any such case, the maturity of a portion or all of its long-term indebtedness could be accelerated.  In addition, the acceleration of amounts due under the
senior credit facility will also cause a cross-default under the indenture for the 10¼% senior notes.

12% Senior Discount Notes

In March 1998, the Company issued $269.0 million of its 12% senior discount notes due March 1, 2008. The issuance of the senior discount notes netted
approximately $150.2 million in proceeds to the Company. The senior discount notes accrete in value until March 1, 2003 at which time they will have an aggregate principal amount of $269.0 million. Thereafter, interest will accrue on the senior
discount notes and will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, commencing September 1, 2003. Proceeds from the senior discount notes were used to acquire and construct telecommunications towers as well as for general
working capital purposes.

The 12% senior discount notes are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment with the Company’s
other existing and future senior indebtedness.  The 12% senior discount notes place certain restrictions on, among other things, the incurrence of debt and liens, issuance of preferred stock, payment of dividends or other distributions, sales
of assets, transaction with affiliates, sale and leaseback transactions, certain investments and the Company’s ability to merge or consolidate with other entities.  The ability of the Company to comply with the covenants and other terms of
the 12% senior discount notes and to satisfy its respective debt obligations will depend on the future operating performance of the Company. In the event the Company fails to comply with the various covenants contained in the 12% senior discount
notes it would be in default thereunder, and in any such case, the maturity of a portion or all of its long-term indebtedness could be accelerated.  In addition, the acceleration of amounts due under the senior credit facility will also cause a
cross-default under the indenture for the 12% senior discount notes.

Senior Credit Facility

In June 2001, SBA Telecommunications entered into a $300.0 million senior secured credit facility. The facility provides for a $100.0 million term loan and a $200.0
million revolving loan, the availability of which is based on compliance with certain covenants. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $100.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $155.0 million under the revolving loan.  In addition,
the Company had $14.5 million of letters of credit issued on its behalf to serve as collateral to secure certain obligations in the ordinary course of business.  Based on the current agreement, the term loan and the revolving loan mature June
15, 2007 and amortization of the term loan begins

in September 2003.  Under the current terms of the senior credit facility, the Company is required to use substantially all net proceeds of asset sales to repay
outstanding debt under the senior credit facility.  As a result, the Company has calculated its current debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 to include substantially all of the net proceeds from the proposed sale of 801 towers to AAT
Communications of $188.0 million.  However, as more fully discussed in Note 2, it is the Company’s intent to seek an amendment to the senior credit facility and in exchange for certain modifications, the Company would repay approximately
$150.0 million of this facility in 2003.  The receipt of this amendment to the senior credit facility is a condition to the consummation of the AAT Transaction.  Borrowings under the senior secured credit facility accrue interest at the
euro dollar rate plus a margin or a base rate plus a margin, as defined in the agreement. The senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of SBA Telecommunications and its subsidiaries.  The senior credit
facility contains certain restrictive covenants.  These covenants place certain restrictions on, among other things, the incurrence of debt and liens, the sale of assets, capital expenditures, transactions with affiliates, sale and lease-back
transactions and the number of towers that can be built without anchor tenants.  If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility.  The acceleration of amounts due
under the senior credit facility will also cause a cross-default under both of the Company’s indentures.

As of December 31, 2002,
the Company was in compliance with the covenants of each of the above agreements (see Note 2).

The Company’s debt at December 31,
2002 matures as follows:

The Company previously entered into
an interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure to interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of its $500 million senior notes from interest-rate fixed to variable notes.  During October 2002, the counter-party to this
agreement elected to terminate the agreement.  This termination resulted in a $5.4 million deferred gain which is recorded  in long-term debt and is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the notes
to which the swap related.  The amortization of the remaining deferred gain as of December 31, 2002 is as follows:

b.       Registration of Additional Shares

During 2001, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering an aggregate 5.0 million
shares of its Class A common stock. These 5.0 million shares are in addition to 3.0 million shares registered during 2000. These shares may be issued in connection with acquisitions of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related
services.  During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company issued 1.3 million shares under these registration statements for one acquisition and certain earn-outs.  During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company issued 1.6
million shares of its Class A common stock pursuant to these registration statements in connection with six acquisitions and certain earn-outs. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company issued 1.1 million shares pursuant to these
registration statements in connection with ten acquisitions.

c.       Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

In 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 1999 Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”). A total of
500,000 shares of Class A common stock are reserved for purchase under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employee participants to purchase Class A common stock at a price per share which is equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair
market value of the Class A common stock on the first or the last day of an offering period.  As of December 31, 2002, employees had purchased 271,038 shares under the Purchase Plan.

d.       Shareholder rights plan

During January 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each
outstanding share of the Company’s common stock. Each of these rights, which are currently not exercisable, will entitle the holder to purchase one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of the Company’s newly designated Series E Junior
Participating Preferred Stock. In the event that any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock or commences or announces an intention to commence a tender offer that
would result in such person or group owning 15% or more of the Company’s common stock, each holder of a right (other than the acquirer) will be entitled to receive, upon payment of the exercise price, a number of shares of common stock having a
market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. In order to retain flexibility and the ability to maximize shareholder value in the event of transactions that may arise in the future, the Board retains the power to redeem the rights
for a set amount. The rights were distributed on January 25, 2002 and expire on January 10, 2012, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged or terminated in accordance with the Rights Agreement.

13.     STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

The Company has three stock option plans (the
1996 Stock Option Plan, the 1999 Equity Participation Plan and the 2001 Equity Participation Plan), whereby options (both non-qualified and incentive stock options), stock appreciation rights and restricted stock may be granted to directors,
employees and consultants. Upon adoption of the 2001 Equity Participation Plan, all unissued options under the 1996 Stock Option Plan and the 1999 Equity Participation Plan were cancelled. The 2001 Equity Participation Plan provides for a maximum
issuance of shares, together with all outstanding options and unvested shares of restricted stock under all three of the plans, equal to 15% of the Company’s common stock outstanding, adjusted for certain shares issued pursuant to the exercise
of certain options.  A summary of shares reserved for future issuance under these plans is as follows:

These options generally vest

14.     RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

In August 2001, in response to deteriorating capital market conditions within the telecommunications industry, the Company implemented a plan of restructuring
primarily associated with the downsizing of its new tower build construction activities.  The plan included the abandonment of certain acquisition and new tower build sites resulting in a non-cash charge of approximately $24.1 million. 
The plan also included the elimination of 102 employee positions and closing and/or consolidation of selected offices.  Payments made related to employee separation and office closings were approximately $0.3 million.

In February 2002, as a result of the continuing deterioration of capital market conditions for wireless carriers, the Company announced that it was
further reducing its capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities, suspending any material new investment for additional towers, reducing its workforce and closing or consolidating offices.  Under current capital
market conditions, the Company does not anticipate building or buying a material number of new towers beyond those it is currently contractually obligated to build or buy, thereby resulting in the abandonment of a majority of its existing new tower
build and acquisition work in process during 2002.  In connection with this restructuring, a portion of the Company’s workforce has been reduced and certain offices have been closed, substantially all of which were primarily dedicated to
new tower development activities.  As a result of the implementation of its plans, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $63.7 million in accordance with SFAS 144, andEmerging Issues Task Force 94-3,

Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity, including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring.

Of the $63.7 million restructuring charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2002, approximately $40.4 million related to the abandonment of new tower build
and acquisition work in process and related construction materials on approximately 764 sites and approximately $16.4 million relates to the impairment of approximately 144 tower sites held and used in operations.  The abandonment of new tower
build and acquisition work in process resulted in the write-off of all costs incurred to date.  The impairment of operating tower assets resulted primarily from the Company’s evaluation of its operating tower portfolio using a projected
cash flow analysis and assets were written down to fair value determined on a discounted cash flow analysis. Towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no current tenants and little or no prospects for future lease-up.  The
remaining $6.9 million charge related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 470 employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately 40 offices.  Exit costs associated with the
closing and consolidation of offices primarily represent the Company’s estimate of future lease obligations after considering sublease opportunities.

Approximately $1.7 million remains in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2002, representing primarily future lease obligations related to closed offices and future
ground lease obligations on canceled sites.  A summary of the restructuring charge for the year ended December 31, 2002 is as follows:

In connection with the
Company’s implementation of SFAS 142, goodwill of $13.4 million recorded during  2002 resulting from the achievement of certain contingent earn-out obligations under various construction acquisition agreements was subject to an
impairment.  As a result of this analysis, the entire $13.4 million of goodwill within the site development construction segment was determined to be impaired (see Note 5).  The $13.4 goodwill impairment charge is included within the
restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as management believes that it is not “more likely than not” that the Company will be
able to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to recognize the assets.

The Company has available at December 31, 2002, a
net operating tax loss carry-forward of approximately $282.1  million. Approximately $8.6 million, $35.8 million, $99.9 million and $137.8 million of the net operating tax loss carry-forwards will expire in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022,
respectively.

16.     DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT

Effective January 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure to interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion
of its $500.0 million senior notes from interest rate fixed to variable rates.  The Company accounted for the swap in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and its corresponding
amendments under SFAS 138,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.  SFAS 133 required the Company to record the fair value of the swap on the balance sheet.  The
Company’s swap was accounted for as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133.  The swap qualified for the shortcut method of recognition and, therefore, no portion of the swap was treated as ineffective.  Accordingly, the entire change in
fair value of the swap was offset against the change in fair value of the related senior notes.

The notional principal amount of the swap
was $100.0 million and the maturity date and payment provisions matched that of the underlying senior notes.  The swap was to mature in seven years and provided for the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without the
exchange of the underlying notional amount.  The variable rates were based on six-month EURO plus 4.47% and were reset on a semi-annual basis.  The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received was accrued as
interest rates changed in accordance with the agreement and were recognized as an adjustment to interest expense.  The Company recorded a reduction of approximately $3.1  million to interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2002
as a result of the differential between fixed and variable rates.

During October 2002, the counter-party to the interest rate swap
agreement elected to terminate the swap agreement effective October 15, 2002.  In connection with this termination, the counter-party was required to pay the Company $6.2 million which included approximately $.8 million in accrued
interest.  The remaining approximately $5.4 million received was deferred and is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes using the effective interest method.  Amortization of the
deferred gain during 2002 was approximately $0.2 million.  The remaining deferred gain balance at December 31, 2002 of $5.2 million is included in long-term debt in the December 31, 2002 balance sheet.

17.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

a.       Operating Leases

The Company is obligated under various non-cancelable operating leases for land, office space, vehicles and equipment, and site leases that expire at various times
through May 2100.  The annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2002 are as follows:

Principally, all of the leases provide for renewal at varying escalations. Leases providing for fixed rate
escalations have been reflected above.

Rent expense for operating leases was $34.3 million, $26.3 million, and $17.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The rent expense of $34.3 million for year ended December 31, 2002 excludes $2.4 million which is included in restructuring and other charge.  In addition, certain of the
Company’s leases include contingent rent provisions which provide for the lessor to receive additional rent upon the attainment of certain tower operating results and/or lease-up.  Contingent rent expense for the year ended December 31,
2002 was $1.8 million.

b.       Tenant Leases

The annual minimum tower lease income to be received for tower space and antenna rental under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2002 are as follows:

c.       Employment Agreements

The Company has employment agreements with certain officers of the Company that grant these employees the right to receive their base salary and continuation of
certain benefits in the event of a termination (as defined by the agreement of such employees).

d.       Litigation

The Company is involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate
outcome of such matters and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs that may be incurred, management believes the resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

e.       Contingent
Purchase Obligations

The Company sometimes agrees to pay additional consideration if the towers or businesses that are acquired meet
or exceed certain earnings or new tower targets in the 1-3 years after they have been acquired.  As of December 31, 2002, the Company had an obligation to pay up to an additional $5.8 million in consideration if the earnings targets identified
in various acquisition agreements are met.  This obligation consisted of approximately $2.0 million associated with an acquisition within the Company’s site development construction segment and approximately $3.8 million associated with
acquisitions within the Company’s site leasing segment.  At the Company’s option, a majority of the additional consideration may be paid in cash or Class A common stock.  The Company records such obligations when it becomes
probable that the earnings targets will be met.  As of December 31, 2002, certain earnings targets associated with an acquisition within the site development construction segment were achieved, and therefore, the Company accrued approximately
$2.0 million, within other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  This amount was paid in cash in February 2003.

18.     DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The Company has a defined contribution profit sharing plan under Section 401 (k) of the Internal Revenue Code that provides for voluntary employee contributions of 1%
to 14% of compensation.  Employees have the opportunity to participate following completion of three months of employment and must be 21 years of age.  Employer matching begins after completion of one year of service.  The Company
currently makes a discretionary matching contribution of 50% of an employee’s contributions up to a maximum of $3,000.  Company matching contributions were $.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

19.     SEGMENT DATA

The Company operates principally in three business
segments: site development consulting, site development construction, and site leasing. The Company’s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different services.  They are managed separately based on the fundamental
differences in their operations. Revenues, gross profit, capital expenditures (including assets acquired through the issuance of the Company’s Class A common stock) and identifiable assets pertaining to the segments in which the Company
operates are presented below:

We have client concentrations with
respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments.  Of our total site development consulting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, the following two customers represented 63.8% of total revenue from this segment: Cingular
represented 29.6% and Bechtel Corporation represented 34.2%.  Of our total site development construction revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, one customer, Bechtel Corporation, represented 28.1% of such revenue.  Of our total site
leasing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, one customer, AT&T Wireless, represented 15.7% of such revenue.

20.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In February 2003, in response to the continued deterioration in expenditures by wireless service providers, particularly with respect to site
development activities, the Company committed to a new plan of restructuring associated with further downsizing activities, including reduction in workforce and closing or consolidation of offices.  The Company anticipates closing an additional
9 to 15 offices and eliminating the positions of 70 to 100 employees during the first quarter of 2003, substantially all related to the Company’s site development operations.  The Company anticipates incurring a restructuring charge
related to these costs of up to $2.0 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)

On March 17, 2003 certain of the Company’s subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with AAT Communications to sell 679 towers or, if AAT Communications
elects to purchase an additional 122 towers, an aggregate of 801 towers, which represent substantially all of the Company’s towers in the western two-thirds of the U.S.  Gross proceeds from the sale are anticipated to be $160.0 million if
679 towers are sold, or $203.0 million if 801 towers are sold, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  The AAT Transaction is expected to close in stages commencing on May 9, 2003 and ending on September 30, 2003.  The Company
intends to use substantially all of the proceeds, net of anticipated transaction costs of approximately $5 million, to reduce indebtedness.  The sale is subject to a number of conditions, including an amendment to the senior credit
facility.  As of December 31, 2002, the carrying value of the 679 towers included in the first part of the AAT Transaction was approximately $165.5 and the carrying value of the remaining 122 towers included in the second part of the AAT
Transaction was approximately $30.5 million.

21.     QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (unaudited)

(1)

The reported amounts above for the quarter ended March
31, 2002 are different than the amounts previously reported in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2002.  This difference is a result of the $80.6 million cumulative effect charge related to the implementation of SFAS
142, which was recorded retroactive to the adoption date of January 1, 2002.  The charge increased the first quarter’s previously reported net loss of ($83.2) million, or ($1.70) per share to ($163.8) million, or ($3.34) per
share.
