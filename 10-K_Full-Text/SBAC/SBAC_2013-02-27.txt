ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

We are a leading
independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers. Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in Canada, Central America and South America. Our primary business line
is our site leasing business, which contributed 97.4% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012. In our site leasing business, we lease antenna space primarily to wireless service providers on towers and other
structures that we own, manage or lease from others. The towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider, built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired. As of December 31, 2012, we
owned 17,491 tower sites, the majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. We also managed or leased approximately
4,800 actual or potential communications sites, approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of December 31, 2012. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in
developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term
lease contracts in the United States, Canada, Central America and South America. Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Digicel, Claro, and
Telefonica. Wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site. In the United States and Canada our tenant leases are generally for an
initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. Tenant leases in
our Central and South America markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5-year renewal periods. In Central America, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the United States and Canada while our leases in South America
typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index.

We expand our tower portfolio, both domestically and
internationally, through the construction of new towers, or new builds, and through the acquisition of towers from third parties. In our new build program, we construct towers in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under build-to-suit
arrangements. Under build-to-suit arrangements, we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified. We retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to co-locate additional tenants on the tower. When we
construct towers in locations chosen by us, we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need, or will need, to locate antennas to meet capacity or
service demands. We seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete pre-construction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts. We generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each
new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants. During 2013, we intend to build between 380 and 400 new towers, domestically and internationally.

In our tower acquisition program, we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential
returns. For each acquisition, we prepare various analyses that include projections of a five-year unlevered internal rate of return, review of available capacity, future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenant/technology
mix.



The table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower
portfolio over the past three years.

(1)

Reclassifications reflect the combination for reporting purposes of multiple tower structures on a single parcel of real estate, which we market and customers view as a
single location, into a single owned tower site. Dispositions reflect the decommissioning, sale, conveyance or other legal transfer of owned tower sites.

As of December 31, 2012, we had an average of 2.0 tenants per tower.

Our
site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. Our site leasing business generated 88.7% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 and has represented 97.4% or more of our total
segment operating profit for the past three years. For the year ended December 31, 2012, site leasing revenues generated outside the U.S. and its territories was less than 6% of total revenue.

International Operations

In 2012, we continued to focus on growing our international operations, including the acquisition of 800 towers in Brazil. We believe that
we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a high-growth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments. At December 31, 2012, we
owned 2,562 towers in Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama, and intend to continue expanding in these and other international markets. The majority of these international markets typically have less mature
wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and wireless data penetration. Accordingly, our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by (i) wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their
networks, (ii) consumers’ increased use of high data applications, such as email, internet access and video, and (iii) incremental spectrum auctions, which have resulted in new market entrants, as well as incremental voice and data
network deployments. For example, we have had a meaningful build-out of our new towers and communication sites in Costa Rica as a result of spectrum auctions in that country. We expect to continue expanding internationally through buying or building
towers, managing communication sites and leasing space to wireless service providers on assets we control.

We consider various factors when
identifying a market for our international expansion, including:

•

Country analysis

– We consider the country’s political stability, and whether the country’s general business, legal and
regulatory environment is conducive to the sustainability and growth of our business.

•

Market potential

– We analyze the expected demand for wireless services, and whether a country has multiple wireless service providers who
are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks, as well as spectrum auctions that have occurred or that are anticipated to occur.

•

Risk adjusted return criteria

– We consider whether buying or building towers in a country, and providing our management and leasing
services, will meet our return criteria. As part of this analysis, we consider the risk of entering into an international market, and how our expansion meets our long-term strategic objectives for the region and our business generally.



Site Development Services

Our site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service
providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development services
revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network
pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and
related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning and maintenance.

We provide our site development services on a local basis, through regional offices, territory offices and project offices. The regional offices are responsible for all site development operations,
including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices, and a substantial portion of the sales in such area.

For
financial information about our operating segments, please see Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

Industry Developments

We believe that growing wireless traffic (particularly data and video), the deployment of additional spectrum, and technology advancements
will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of communication sites that they use or the number of antennas at existing communication
sites. The following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry:

•

As wireless data usage grows rapidly, all four U.S. nationwide carriers are deploying new and upgraded networks and we believe that the continued
deployment of 4G wireless technologies, such as LTE, will require our customers to add large numbers of additional cell sites and additional equipment at current cell sites.

•

We have seen, and anticipate there could be other, new entrants into the wireless communications industry that could deploy regional or national
wireless networks for voice and data services.

•

Spectrum licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in 2006 and 2008 has enabled continued network development, and we expect this and the
potential availability of additional spectrum should enable continued network development in the U.S. In August 2012, Verizon received regulatory approval to purchase spectrum originally auctioned in 2006 to SpectrumCo, a joint venture of cable
companies. Also, in December, 2012, Dish Networks received regulatory approval to terrestrially deploy certain of its spectrum that was previously limited for use in satellite based networks.

•

Consumers are increasing their use of wireless data services due to expansion of wireless data applications, such as email, web browsing, social
networking, music and video, and continued wireline to wireless migration. Wireless devices are trending toward more bandwidth intensive devices such as smartphones, laptops, netbooks, tablets and other emerging and embedded devices. As a result,
management believes that North American mobile data traffic will grow at an approximately 56% compound annual growth rate from 2012 to 2017.

•

Consumers list network coverage and quality as two of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when terminating or changing service. To
decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth, wireless carriers have made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage. For example, U.S. wireless carriers’ capital expenditures
have increased from an estimated $19.9 billion in 2009 to an estimated $28.6 billion in 2012, and we expect capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to remain elevated as wireless carriers continue to improve their networks.



Despite the recent economic challenges affecting the global marketplace, based on these
factors, we believe that the world-wide wireless industry will continue to grow and is well-capitalized, highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services. Therefore, we expect that we will see a multi-year trend of strong additional
cell site demand from our customers, which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us.

Business Strategy

Our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as
long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins and low customer churn. The long-term nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business, which is more cyclical.
By focusing on our site leasing business, we believe that we can maintain a stable, recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending. Key elements of our strategy include:

Maximizing Use of Tower Capacity.

We generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a
majority of our towers are high capacity towers. Most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost. We actively market space on
our towers through our internal sales force.

Disciplined Growth of our Tower Portfolio

.

We believe that our
tower operations are highly scalable. Consequently, we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling, general and administrative expenses. During 2013, we intend to continue to grow
our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, by 5% to 10%; through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers. In connection with our international expansion, we have targeted select international markets that we believe have
relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communication industry. We intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity, including borrowings, to build and/or acquire new towers at prices that we
believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our long-term target leverage ratios.

Capitalizing on our Scale and Management Experience.

We are a large owner, operator and developer of tower and other communication sites, with substantial capital, human and operating resources. We
have been developing communication sites for wireless service providers in the U.S. since 1989 and owned and operated tower sites for ourselves since 1997. We believe our size, experience, capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for
wireless service providers both in the U.S. and internationally. Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development, with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries. Management believes
that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services.

Controlling our Underlying Land Positions

. We have purchased and intend to continue to purchase and/or enter into perpetual
easements or long-term leases for the land that underlies our towers, to the extent available at commercially



reasonable prices. We believe that these purchases, perpetual easements, and/or long-term leases will increase our margins, improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to
increases in ground lease rents in the future. For the quarter ended December 31, 2012, approximately 70% of our tower sites were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground
leases, including renewal options under our control, was 31 years. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 6.1% of our tower sites have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years.

Using our Local Presence to Build Strong Relationships with Major Wireless Service Providers.

Given the nature of towers as
location specific communications facilities, we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally. Consequently, we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience, expertise and
relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships. We are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally. Due to our presence in local markets, we believe we are well positioned to capture
additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets.

Customers

Since commencing operations, we have performed site leasing and
site development services for all of the large U.S. wireless service providers. In both our site leasing and site development businesses, we work with large national providers and smaller regional, local or private operators.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues. The following customers
represented at least 10% of our total revenues during the last three years:

During the past two years, we provided services for a number of customers, including:



Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing goals are to:

•

use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with
respect to our owned or managed towers, enabling us to grow our site leasing business; and

•

successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins and/or provide a financial or
strategic benefit to our site leasing business.

We approach sales on a company-wide basis, involving many
of our employees. We have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team. Our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office. We also rely on our vice presidents, general
managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers. Our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers. Most wireless service providers have
national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices. We believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate
headquarters. Our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate. Our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentive-based goals and
measurements.

Competition

Site Leasing

– Our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are (1) the national independent tower companies including American Tower Corporation, Crown Castle International
and Global Tower Partners, (2) a large number of regional independent tower owners, (3) wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers, and
(4) alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, billboards and electric transmission towers. As a result of several large mergers and acquisitions, American Tower and Crown
Castle have more towers and greater financial resources than we do. Wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally larger and have greater financial resources than we do. We believe that tower location
and capacity, quality of service to our tenants, and, to a lesser extent, price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. Internationally, to date, the competition we have
encountered has been from both independent tower companies and wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks. In our Central American and Canadian markets, the majority of existing towers are owned by wireless service
providers. In Brazil, our competition includes wireless service providers, as well as, independent tower companies.

Site
Development

– The site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive. We believe that the majority of our competitors in the U.S. site development business operate within local market areas exclusively, while some firms
offer their services nationally. The market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site development consultants, zoning consultants, real
estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors, which provide end-to-end site development services through multiple
subcontractors, and wireless service providers’ internal staff. We believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria, including: company experience, price, track record, local reputation,
geographic reach and time for completion of a project.



Employees

Our executive, corporate development, accounting, finance, human resources, legal and regulatory, information technology and site administration personnel, and our network operations center, are located
in our headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida. Certain sales, new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our Boca Raton office. Our remaining employees are based in our international, regional, and local offices.

As of December 31, 2012, we had 1,022 employees, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Of
these 1,022 employees, 103 were based outside of the U.S. and its territories. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Regulatory
and Environmental Matters

Federal Regulations.

In the U.S., which accounted for 94.3% of our total site leasing
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012, both the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas. Many FAA
requirements are implemented in FCC regulations. These regulations govern the construction, lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures, as well as the maintenance, inspection, and record keeping related to towers and structures,
and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures, require prior approval and registration of towers or structures before they may be constructed, altered or used. Wireless communications equipment and radio or television
stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used. In addition, any applicant for an FCC antenna tower or structure
registration must certify that, consistent with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of Federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled
substance.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the FCC, in conjunction with the FAA,
has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures. These standards mandate that the FCC and the FAA consider the height of the proposed tower or structure, the relationship of the tower or structure
to existing natural or man-made obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the FAA to ensure the
structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. The FAA may condition its issuance of a no-hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting and/or painting requirements. Antenna towers that meet certain height and location
criteria must also be registered with the FCC. A tower or structure that requires FAA clearance will not be registered by the FCC until it is cleared by the FAA. Upon registration, the FCC may also require special lighting and/or painting. Owners of
wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with FAA and FCC regulations. Antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those
towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the FAA of any lighting outage or malfunction.

Owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to, and therefore must comply with, environmental laws. Any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to
environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, among other statutes, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances. The FCC has issued regulations
implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. These regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential



significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless
communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure. In the event the FCC determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the FCC has developed, the FCC would
be required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which will be subject to public comment. This process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure.

We generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction,
modification, or placement of antenna towers or structures. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction, modification and placement of towers.
The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of radio communication towers.
Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities. This may require that federal agencies and departments work
directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities.

As an owner and operator of real property,
we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination and related personal or property damage. We are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern
tower or structure placement, including pre-construction environmental studies. Operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency (“RF”) emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural
and operating requirements. Certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to RF
emissions. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can produce negative health effects. The potential connection between low-level RF energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study
by the scientific community in recent years. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws. These costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and
liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

State and Local Regulations.

Most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition, leasing activities and construction
activities. Where required, we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents, who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors, and conduct the
construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors, who may be our employees or independent contractors. Local regulations include city and other local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants
imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations, or certain other
entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures. In addition, many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to
secure their removal obligations. Local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures, and have, in some
instances, instituted moratoria.

International

. Regulatory regimes outside of the U.S. and its territories vary by
country and locality, however these regulations typically require tower owners and/or licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an
existing



tower. Additionally, some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting, lighting, and maintenance. Our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign
ownership of land in certain areas. Based on our experience to date, these regimes have been similar to, but not more rigorous, burdensome or comprehensive than, those in the U.S. Non-compliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties
or deconstruction orders. Our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters. As we expand our operations into additional international
geographic areas, we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions.

Backlog

Backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments, which have been signed, but have not yet
commenced. As of December 31, 2012, excluding the Sprint Network Vision Amendment, we had 1,052 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases and amendments will
contractually provide for approximately $8.1 million of annual revenue. By comparison, as of December 31, 2011, we had 251 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases
and amendments contractually provided for approximately $5.1 million of annual revenue.

Our backlog for site development
services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $45.9 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately $14.5 million as of
December 31, 2011.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Business

If
our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected.

Significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for
tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar. In connection with the combinations of Verizon Wireless and ALLTEL (to form Verizon Wireless),
Cingular and AT&T Wireless (to form AT&T Mobility) and Sprint PCS and Nextel (to form Sprint Nextel), the combined companies have rationalized and may continue to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks, which has led and may
continue to lead to the non-renewal of certain leases on our towers. If our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of, among other factors, limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the U.S., this consolidation
could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks, which could materially and adversely affect our future operating
results.

We have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take
advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.

As indicated below, we have and will continue to have a
significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. The following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2011 and 2012.

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash
sufficient to pay the principal, interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness. Subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of
which may be secured debt. This may have the effect of increasing our total leverage.

As a consequence of our indebtedness,
(1) demands on our cash resources may increase, (2) we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (3) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on
certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. For example, as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the U.S. economy:

•

we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise, thereby reducing our cash flows;

•

we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate
requirements that would be in our best long-term interests;



•

we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing
the available cash flow to fund other investments, including tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures;

•

we may be required to reduce our annual tower acquisition or new build goals;

•

we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;

•

we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and

•

we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment
obligations.

These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our
ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities.

In addition,
fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans, and may make it difficult to refinance our existing
indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all. There is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on
our current indebtedness.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue, and the loss, consolidation or
financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenues.

We derive a
significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. Consequently, a reduction in demand for site leasing, reduced future capital expenditures on the networks, or the loss, as a result of bankruptcy, merger with other customers of
ours or otherwise, of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth. Our substantial acquisitions in 2012 further increased our client concentration and exacerbated the risks associated
with such concentration.

The following is a list of significant customers (representing at least 10% of revenue in any of the
last three years) and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers:

We also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments:



Revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development
contracts. Each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the U.S. and Canada, and renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. Our
Central and South America markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5-year renewal periods. However, if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital
expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time
without penalty. In addition, a customer’s need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. Furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for
additional projects.

A slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect
our future growth and revenues.

If wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use, or fail to
widely adopt and use wireless data applications, our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services. Regardless of consumer demand, each wireless service customer must have substantial capital resources
and capabilities to build out their wireless networks, including licenses for spectrum. In addition, our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing, roaming or resale arrangements. As a result of all of the above,
wireless carriers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Our international operations are subject to economic, political and other risks, including risks
associated with foreign currency exchange rates, that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position.

Our current business operations in Canada, Central America and South America, and our expansion into any other international markets in the future, could result in adverse financial consequences and
operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. Although the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were less than 6% during the year ended December 31, 2012, we anticipate that our revenues from
our international operations will grow in the future. Accordingly, our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;

•

laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital;

•

laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our communications sites and conduct business, including zoning, maintenance and environmental
matters, and laws related to ownership of real property;

•

laws and regulations governing our employee relations, including occupational health and safety matters;

•

changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of tower sites, which may be
applied and enforced retroactively;

•

expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership;

•

restricting or revoking spectrum licenses;

•

our ability to comply with, and the costs of compliance with, anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar local
anti-bribery laws;

•

our ability to compete with owners and operators of wireless communications towers that have been in the international market for a longer period of
time than we have;

•

uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems, including inconsistencies between and within laws, regulations and decrees, and judicial application
thereof, and delays in the judicial process;

•

health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic;

•

difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel; and

•

language and cultural differences.

The majority of our international operations are denominated in United States dollars. However, for some of our international operations, particularly Brazil, we face risks associated with changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast
and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts.

If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers,
it could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our real property interests relating to our towers
consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and other similar interests. From time to time, we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land
under our towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers. Further, landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties,
including ground lease aggregators and our competitors, which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a future material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition, we may not always have the ability to
analyze and verify all information regarding title, access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers. To the extent that we do not have complete access to, or use of, the land underlying the acquired towers, it could require us
to incur additional expenses before we can operate and generate revenue from such tower.



Increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio long term.

We currently intend to grow our tower portfolio 5% to 10% annually, domestically and internationally, through
acquisitions and new builds. Our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements. Traditionally, our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from
smaller tower companies, independent tower developers and wireless service providers. However, as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these mid-sized tower transactions available and there is more competition to
acquire existing towers. Increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, higher acquisition prices, and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers. Furthermore,
to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us. As a result of these risks, the cost of acquiring these
towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2013. If we are not able to successfully address these challenges, we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the long-term.

Our convertible note hedge transactions may not cover all of the potential dilution or additional cash outlay, if we settled the notes
in cash, to which we may be subject upon conversion of the notes.

Concurrently with the pricing of our 1.875%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the “1.875% Notes”) and our 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (the “4.0% Notes”) we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of
the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1.875% Notes is $41.46 per share of our Class A common stock (the same as the initial conversion price
of our 1.875% convertible notes) and the upper strike price of the warrants is $67.37 per share. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 4.0% convertible Notes is $30.38 per share of our Class A
common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 4.0% Notes) and the upper strike price of the warrant transactions is $44.64 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the warrant transaction, we are responsible for the dilution or costs, to
the extent that we settle in cash or stock, arising from the conversion of the notes to the extent that the market price of our Class A common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. We have purchased an aggregate of $81.2 million in
principal amount of the 1.875% Notes, and $468.8 million remains outstanding. If the market price of our Class A common stock significantly exceeded either of these strike prices on their respective conversion dates we would be subject to
material dilution or, to the extent we elected to settle in cash, material additional costs.

Initially we entered into
convertible note hedge and warrant transactions to cover the full amount of the shares that were issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes and the 4.0% Notes. However, as a result of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc.
(“Lehman Derivatives”), we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction that we had entered into with Lehman Derivatives. The terminated convertible note hedge transaction had originally covered 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of our
Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our 1.875% Notes. Consequently, we do not currently have a hedge with respect to that percentage of the shares issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes To the extent that the
market price of our Class A common stock exceeds $41.46 per share upon conversion of the notes, we will be subject to dilution or if we settle in cash, additional costs, upon conversion of that portion of the 1.875% Notes. If any of the other
counterparties to our convertible hedge transactions were to default in their obligations, then our potential dilution or costs upon conversion of the respective notes would be materially increased.

At the end of the first quarter of 2012 the 4.0% Notes became convertible by the note holders because our Class A common stock
closing price per share exceeded $39.49 for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on March 31, 2012. The requisite conditions were again met as of the end of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2012
and the 4.0% Notes remained convertible by the note holders. The 4.0% Notes will continue to be convertible through March 31, 2013, and will still be convertible thereafter, if one or more of the conversion conditions are satisfied.



At the end of the third quarter of 2012, the conversion right for the 1.875% Notes was
triggered because our Class A common stock closing price per share exceeded $53.90 for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on September 30, 2012. The requisite conditions were again met as of the
end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and the 1.875% Notes remained convertible by the note holders. The 1.875% Notes will continue to be convertible until March 31, 2013, and may be convertible thereafter, if one or more of the conversion
conditions are satisfied.

New technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results
of operations.

The emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. For example, the
increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna
and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider (i.e. network sharing) could reduce the demand for our tower space. Additionally, the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as beam forming or “smart
antennae,” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space. The
development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video, voice and data services by satellites or other technologies, could also adversely affect the demand
for our tower space. If any of these or other new technologies are widely adopted in the future it could have a material adverse effect on our growth and results of operations.

Our acquisition initiatives may disrupt our operations or heighten the risks inherent in our growth strategy. In addition, future acquisitions that are material in the aggregate may increase our
debt levels and our leverage.

A key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through
acquisitions. Consequently, as part of our business, we evaluate potential acquisitions, some of which may be, individually or in the aggregate, materially significant in terms of the number of towers to be acquired or the price that we would need
to pay. Any future acquisitions that we may consummate that are material could increase our absolute level of debt and our pro forma leverage ratio.

In addition, acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy, such as (i) an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the
acquired towers do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models, (ii) unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions that may impact our results of operations for a period, (iii) increased demands on our cash
resources that may, among other things, impact our ability to explore other opportunities, (iv) undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover, (v) increased vulnerability to general economic conditions, (vi) an
adverse impact on our existing customer relationships, (vii) additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory, political and economic risks if such acquisitions were in new jurisdictions and (viii) diversion of managerial attention.

We may not successfully integrate acquired towers into our operations.

As part of our growth strategy, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions. The process of integrating any acquired towers
into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. It may also result in the loss
of key customers and/or personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities. These risks may be exacerbated in those circumstances in which we acquire a material number of towers. Further, we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be
necessary to operate the business we acquire, and, we may not be able to timely attract new skilled employees and management to replace them. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions into our existing
business.



Delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates
may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate.

There can be no assurances that 3G, 4G or other new wireless
technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. The deployment of 3G experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and
broadcast industries, and deployment of 4G has been limited to date. Additionally, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated. These factors could have
a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.

We may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline.

If wireless service provider demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease, we may not be able to successfully grow
our site leasing business as expected. This may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations. Our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely
depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers.

Increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us.

Our industry is highly competitive, and our customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space. Some of our competitors,
such as (1) U.S. and international wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers and (2) large independent tower companies, are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us. This could provide them with
advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers.

In the site leasing business, we compete with:

•

wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers;

•

national and regional tower companies; and

•

alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor DAS networks, billboards and electric transmission towers.

We believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price
historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. However, competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect
our lease rates. In addition, we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. Increasing competition could also make the
acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly, or limit the acquisition opportunities altogether. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

The site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. There are numerous large and small companies that offer one
or more of the services offered by our site development business. As a result of



this competition, margins in this segment continue to be under pressure. Many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we
consider unprofitable. If margins in this segment were to further decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected.

The documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility.

The indentures governing the 8.25% Notes, the 5.75% Notes and the 5.625% Notes, the Senior Credit Agreement and the Secured Tower Revenue
Securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. Among other things, the
covenants under each indenture limit our ability to:

•

Merge, consolidate or sell assets;

•

Make restricted payments, including pay dividends or make other distributions;

•

Enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

Enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and

•

Issue guarantees of indebtedness.

We are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the Senior Credit Agreement. The Senior Credit Agreement requires SBA Senior Finance II and SBACC to maintain specific financial ratios,
including, at the SBA Senior Finance II level, (1) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA not to exceed 6.0 times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net Hedge Exposure (calculated
in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.0 times for 30 consecutive days and (3) a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest
Expense (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter. In addition, SBACC’s ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (calculated in accordance with the
Senior Credit Agreement) for any fiscal quarter on an annualized basis cannot exceed 9.5 times.

Additionally, the mortgage
loan relating to our Tower Securities contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum debt service coverage ratio. To the extent that the debt service coverage ratio, as of the
end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30 times or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments
required under the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the
debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30 times for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15 times as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all
funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter.

These covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may
not be required to operate under these restrictions. Further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisitions or other opportunities.
If we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments. If any default occurs, all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the Senior Credit Agreement may become immediately due
and payable.



Our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk, which
could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.

Fluctuations in market interest rates may
increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans or upon refinancing our fixed rate debt. As a result, we are exposed to interest rate risk. If interest
rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will
correspondingly decrease. There is no guarantee that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. In the
future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable
rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.

Our dependence on our subsidiaries for
cash flow may negatively affect our business.

We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our
only significant assets are, and are expected to be, the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. We conduct, and expect to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our
ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. Most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries, including the mortgage loan underlying the Tower Securities, the 8.25%
Notes, the 5.75% Notes, the Term Loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal, if
any, under their respective indebtedness. Other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding convertible notes, we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used
by them in their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the
terms of their outstanding debt instruments.

Our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore
we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations.

The demand for
our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of long-term results. Numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including:

•

the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures;

•

the size and scope of our projects;

•

the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’
fiscal year;

•

delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment;

•

seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter;

•

the use of third party providers by our customers;

•

the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development; and

•

general economic conditions.



Although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed
costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space, in anticipation of future contracts. In addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. Therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost
structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services.

We are not profitable and
expect to continue to incur losses.

We are not profitable. The following chart shows the net losses we incurred for
the periods indicated:

Our losses are principally due to depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, interest expense
(including non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees), and losses from the extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above. We expect to continue to incur significant losses, which may affect our ability to service
our indebtedness.

The loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively
affect our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key
personnel. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. We have employment agreements with Jeffrey A. Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kurt L. Bagwell, our Senior Vice President
and President—International, Thomas P. Hunt, our Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, and Brendan T. Cavanagh, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We do not have employment agreements with
any of our other key personnel. If we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, the loss of a significant number of
employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our
business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business.

We are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., both the
Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and the FCC regulate the construction, modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas. In addition, the FCC
separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures. FAA and FCC regulations govern construction, lighting, painting and marking of towers and structures and
may, depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure, require registration of the tower or structure. Certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the FAA to ensure
that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation.

Antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners
may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to FAA and FCC regulations and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. Antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the
responsibility of notifying the FAA of any lighting outages. Certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with



environmental impact requirements. Failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant
indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. In addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth.

Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community
developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification. Local regulations can delay,
prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. In addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us.
Furthermore, with respect to our international new builds, our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions, inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets. These
factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations.

Our towers are subject to damage from natural
disasters.

Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and
earthquakes. We maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. We also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and
deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. A tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a
material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.

To the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual
obligations to our customers, due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances, our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses; however, we would be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to
the affected tower, including ground lease expenses. If we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the
requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to,
hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. As owner, lessee or operator of numerous tower sites, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without regard to
whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The current cost of complying with
these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. However, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. It is possible that these
requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses.

We are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business. We
also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses (“NOLs”)



in U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. Generally, for U.S. federal and state tax purposes, NOLs can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years, and all of our tax years will
remain subject to examination until three years after our NOLs are used or expire. We expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and
regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority.
We believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority. If there are tax benefits, including from our use of NOLs or other tax attributes, that are
challenged successfully by a taxing authority, we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities, which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, we may be limited in our ability to utilize our
NOLs to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes. We have substantial federal and state NOLs, including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as those generated through
our historic business operations. In addition, we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities.

To the extent we believe that a position with respect to an NOL is not more likely than not to be sustained, we do not record the related
deferred tax asset. In addition, for NOLs that meet the recognition threshold, we assess the recoverability of the NOL and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the NOL if recoverability is questionable. Given the
uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our NOLs, we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our NOLs.

Our ability to utilize our NOLs is also dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our NOLs before they
expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our NOLs, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance. We review our uncertain
tax position and the valuation allowance for our NOLs periodically and make adjustments from time to time, which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our NOLs. Our NOLs are also subject to review and
potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the NOLs were incurred, and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our NOLs. If we are
unable to use our NOLs or use of our NOLs is limited, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which
may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future.

The issuance of
equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. We may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control,
caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. Depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change, an ownership change under Section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating
loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income. Currently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is
not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized.



Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may
cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equity-related offerings.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of our
convertible notes, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.

Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from RF energy.

The U.S. government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to RF energy. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can cause negative health effects. The potential connection between
exposure to low levels of RF energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. According to the FCC, the results of these studies to
date have been inconclusive. However, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular,
negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. Moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of RF energy and possible negative health
effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. If we were subject to claims relating to exposure to RF energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

Our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law provide for anti-takeover provisions that
could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws
and Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or
potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our Class A common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions
that they may deem to be in their best interests.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We are headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, where we currently lease approximately 103,000 square feet of office space in multiple
buildings. These leases expire at different dates extending through February 28, 2022. We have entered into long-term leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longer-term. We open
and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business. We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is
reasonably available in the markets within which we operate.

Our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee
interests, leasehold interests created by long-term lease agreements, perpetual easements, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and other similar interests. For the quarter ended December 31, 2012, approximately 70% of our tower sites were
located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years. The average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, has
been extended to 31 years. In rural areas, a wireless communications site typically consists of up to a 10,000 square foot tract, which supports towers, equipment shelters and related equipment. Less than 2,500 square feet is required for a monopole
or self-supporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications tower sites. Land leases generally have an initial term of five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five
years, for a total of thirty years or more.



ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the
ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE

Not Applicable.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read
in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to,
those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers. Our principal operations are in the United States and
its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in Canada, Central America and South America. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed approximately 97.4% of our total segment operating profit for the year
ended December 31, 2012. In our site leasing business, we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own, manage or lease from others. The towers that we own have been constructed by us at the
request of a wireless service provider, built or constructed based on our own initiative, or acquired. As of December 31, 2012, we owned 17,491 tower sites, the majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators
who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. We also managed or leased approximately 4,800 actual or potential communications sites, approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of
December 31, 2012. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term
lease contracts in the United States, Canada, Central America and South America. Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Digicel, Claro, and
Telefonica. Wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site. In the United States and Canada our tenant leases are generally for an
initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. Tenant leases in
our Central and South America markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5-year renewal periods. In Central America, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the United States and Canada while our leases in South America
typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index.

Cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:

•

Rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests;

•

Straight-line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly
throughout the lease term (which may include renewal terms) of the underlying property interests;

•

Property taxes;

•

Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);

•

Utilities;

•

Property insurance; and

•

Deferred lease origination cost amortization.



Ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal
terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 3-4% annually or provide for term escalators of approximately 15%. Of the 17,491 tower sites we owned as of December 31, 2012, approximately 70%
were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold or other interest that extends beyond 20 years. For any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an
annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the
taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.

As indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For
information regarding our operating segments, see Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

(1)

Site leasing segment operating profit and total segment operating profit are non-GAAP financial measures. We reconcile these measures and other Regulation G disclosures
in this annual report in the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

We believe that over the long-term,
site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements. We believe our
site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future
expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service
providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers
typically do not relocate, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue.



Site Development Services

Our site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service
providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development services
revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network
pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and
related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning and maintenance.

For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

International Operations

As of December 31, 2012, we had operations
in Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, and Brazil. Our operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business, and we expect to expand operations through new builds and acquisitions. Tenant leases in the
Canadian market typically have similar terms and conditions as those in the United States, with an initial term of five years, and specific rent escalators. Tenant leases in Central America and Brazil typically have a ten year initial term. Tenant
leases in Central America typically have similar renewal terms and rent escalators as those in the United States and Canada while those in Brazil are based on a standard cost of living index.

In our Central American markets, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our new build
activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, our ground leases, our tenant leases and most of our tower related expenses are due, and paid, in U.S. dollars. In our Central American markets, our local currency obligations are principally
limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities and (3) taxes. In our Canadian and Brazilian operations, significantly all of our revenue, expenses and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases
and other tower-related expenses, are denominated in local currency.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of
our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no
need for management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks related to
these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a
detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2012, included herein. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such
differences could be significant.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease
agreements, which are generally five to ten years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred
revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Site development projects in which we perform consulting services include
contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis,
site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, we recognize the revenue related to that phase. Site
development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best
available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “costs and estimated earnings in
excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts,” included within
other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined to be probable.

On October 31, 2011, we entered into a Master Amendment with one of our wireless service
provider customers. The Master Amendment serves as a separate amendment to each individual existing tenant lease agreement that we are currently a party to with that customer. Among other items, the Master Amendment (1) extends the current term
of the individual leases, (2) permits the customer limited early termination rights which will be exercisable over a multi-year period, commencing in the second half of 2013, on a specific number of the existing leases, (3) allows the
customer to make certain specific equipment changes at the tower sites in exchange for an increase in monthly rental payment due from the customer, and (4) slightly modifies the existing monthly lease rates of certain leases. The
customer’s early termination rights are limited with respect to the aggregate



number of leases that may be terminated and the number that may be terminated in any quarter. The specific leases to be terminated early and the timing of such terminations has not been
determined as of the date of this filing. As a result, for accounting and financial statement purposes, we have made assumptions with regard to the leases to be terminated and the timing of the terminations. We have assumed that the customer will
terminate the maximum number of leases allowable in each quarter, selecting the highest rental rate leases at the earliest allowable dates. We believe that these assumptions will ensure that only the minimum known revenue for the pool of leases
covered by the Master Agreement will be accrued on a straight-line basis. Our balance sheet and statement of operations reflect these assumptions. The actual leases that the customer terminates and the timing and number of terminations may or may
not be those that we have identified in our assumptions. We will monitor actual results and elections under the Master Amendment and record any differences from previously made assumptions on a quarterly basis. To the extent that the actual results
materially differ from the assumptions made, we will disclose the impact of these adjustments.

We perform periodic credit
evaluations of our customers. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as
determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. Amounts determined to be
uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable.

Asset Impairment

We evaluate individual long-lived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment
analysis should be performed. We evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists. We evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the
tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present. We have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment.

We record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired, such that future undiscounted
cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site and related intangible. Estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not limited to, general market and economic
conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an
impairment charge.

Property Tax Expense

We typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business. As a result, we recognize
property tax expense, which is reflected as a component of site leasing cost of revenue, based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period. We consider several factors in establishing this estimate,
including our historical level of incurred property taxes, the location of the property, our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information. If our estimates regarding anticipated property
tax expenses are incorrect, a future increase or decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required.



KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This report contains certain non-GAAP
measures, including Segment Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA information. We have provided below a description of such non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and an
explanation as to why management utilizes these measures.

Segment Operating Profit:

We believe that Segment Operating Profit is an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments
and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment, while excluding the impact of depreciation, accretion and amortization, which is largely fixed and non-cash in nature. Segment Operating
Profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The increase in site leasing segment operating profit of $172.8 million in 2012 is primarily due to
additional profit generated by the towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2011 and during the year ended December 31, 2012, organic site leasing growth from new leases, contractual rent escalators, and lease amendments
with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers, control of our site leasing cost of revenue, and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program.

The increase in site leasing segment operating profit of $68.1 million in 2011 is primarily related to additional profit generated by the
revenues from the towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2010 and subsequent to December 31, 2010, organic site leasing growth from new leases, contractual rent escalators, and lease amendments with current tenants which
increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers in the year ended December 31, 2011, control of our site leasing cost of revenue, and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program.

The increase in site development segment operating profit of $6.6 million in 2012 is primarily due to the higher volume of work performed
compared to the prior year associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers including Sprint’s Network Vision initiative.

Each respective Segment Operating Profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues (excluding depreciation, accretion and amortization). Total Segment Operating Profit is the total of
the operating profits of the two segments. The reconciliation of Segment Operating Profit is as follows:



Adjusted EBITDA

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding the impact of net interest expenses, provision for taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset impairment and other charges, non-cash
compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition related expenses, non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, and income from discontinued operations.

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an indicator of the financial performance of our core businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is a component of
the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement, 8.25% Notes, 5.625% Notes, and 5.75% Notes. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating
income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

(1)

Total interest expense includes cash interest expense, non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees.

(2)

Includes $1,095, $1,978 and $1,899 of franchise taxes reflected on the Statement of Operations in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended 2012,
2011 and 2010, respectively.



Adjusted EBITDA was $587.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to
$444.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase of $143.0 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing and site development segments offset partially by the increase in our cash
selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA was $444.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011
as compared to $387.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of $57.5 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended 2012 Compared to Year Ended 2011

Revenues:

Site leasing revenue increased $229.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 largely due to (i) revenues from towers acquired in the latter half of fiscal year 2011 and during the year
ended December 31, 2012 including $125.7 million of additional revenue from the Mobilitie and TowerCo acquisitions, (ii) Towers constructed in the latter half of 2011 and during the year ended December 31, 2012, (iii) organic
site leasing growth from new leases, contractual rent escalators with current tenants and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers, and (iv) increased
straight-line leasing revenue associated with the Sprint Network Vision Agreement entered into in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the master lease amendment entered into with T-Mobile in September 2012.



Site development revenue increased $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012,
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of a higher volume of work performed during 2012 as compared to 2011 associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers including Sprint’s Network
Vision initiative.

Operating Expenses:

Site leasing cost of revenues increased $57 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of tower sites owned by us, including $31.3 million (the majority of which is reimbursable to us) from
the Mobilitie towers acquired in the second quarter and $17.9 million from the TowerCo towers acquired in the fourth quarter.

Site development cost of revenues increased $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the prior year due to
a higher volume of work performed during 2012 as compared to 2011 associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers including Sprint’s Network Vision initiative.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $9.3 million primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, salaries and
benefits, and non-cash compensation expense due in part to the Company’s continued portfolio expansion as well as costs incurred in connection with our international expansion.

Acquisition related expenses increased $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the prior year, primarily
as a result of an increase in acquisition and integration related expenses related to tower acquisitions. Acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2012 associated with the Mobilitie and TowerCo acquisitions were
$30.6 million.

Depreciation, accretion and amortization expense increased $99.3 million to $408.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012 from $309.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase in the number of tower sites built and acquired by us, including through the Mobilitie and TowerCo acquisitions. Depreciation, accretion, and
amortization expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012 includes $73.1 million related to Mobilitie and TowerCo.

Operating Income:

Operating income increased $36.5 million for year ended December 31, 2012 to $147.1 million compared to $110.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to higher segment operating profit in both the site leasing and site development segments offset by increases in depreciation, accretion and amortization expense, acquisition related expenses, and selling,
general and administrative expenses.

Other Income (Expense):

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased $35.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to the higher weighted average principal amount of cash-interest
bearing debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to December 31, 2011 resulting from the issuance of the 2011 Term Loan, 2012-1 Term Loan, 5.75% Notes, Mobilitie Bridge Loan, 2012 Tower Securities, 5.625% Notes,
and the 2012-2 Term Loan. These were offset by the full redemption of $375.0 million of principal balance of the 8.0% Notes and the redemption of $131.3 million in aggregate principal balance of the 8.25% Notes.

Non-cash interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased $6.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2011
primarily as a result of accretion of debt discounts using the effective interest method on the



1.875% Notes, the 4.0% Notes, and the Senior Notes. This was offset by the repurchase of $15.0 million in principal amount of the 1.875% Notes in the first quarter of 2011, the repurchase of
$66.2 million in principal amount of the 1.875% Notes in the fourth quarter of 2012, and by the redemption of $375.0 million of the 8.0% Notes and $131.3 million of the 8.25% Notes in 2012.

Loss from extinguishment of debt was $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $50.1 million from the year
ended December 31, 2011. The increase reflects the premium paid on the redemption of $375.0 million of our 8.0% Notes and $131.3 million of our 8.25% Notes and the write off of their related debt discount and deferred financing fees of $2.5
million and $7.7 million, respectively. Additionally, the loss includes the write off of $3.6 million of deferred financing fees related to the early extinguishment of the Mobilitie Bridge Loan and $2.0 million from the repurchase of $66.2 million
of principal balance of the 1.875% Notes. Comparatively, the loss from extinguishment of debt was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 which was due to the repurchase of $15.0 million in principal amount of the 1.875% Notes.

Net Loss:

Net loss was $181.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $126.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2011. The net loss increased in 2012 primarily due to increases in the loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition related expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization expense as well as interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and
selling, general, and administrative costs. This was offset by an increase in our site leasing segment and site development segment operating profit.



Year Ended 2011 Compared to Year Ended 2010

Revenues

Site leasing revenue increased $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 largely due to (i) organic site leasing growth from new leases, contractual rent escalators with current tenants
and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers and (ii) revenues from the towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2010 and subsequent to
December 31, 2010.

Site development revenue decreased $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, as a result of a lower volume of work performed compared to the prior year.

Operating
Expenses

Site leasing cost of revenues increased $12.8 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of tower
sites owned by us, which was 10,524 at December 31, 2011 up from 9,111 at December 31, 2010 offset by the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program.



Site development cost of revenues decreased $9.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011, as compared to the prior year, as a result of a lower volume of work performed during 2011 as compared to 2010.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million primarily as a result of an increase in salaries, benefits and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from a higher number
of employees, increased non-cash compensation expense as well as costs incurred in connection with our international expansion.

Acquisition related expenses decreased $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the prior year, primarily
as a result of the timing of due diligence and other acquisition related costs for towers acquired or under contract in 2011 compared to 2010.

We recognized an asset impairment charge of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These asset impairment charges resulted from
a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations, using a discounted cash flow analysis, for those towers that have not achieved expected lease-up results, compared to the related net book value of those towers.

Depreciation, accretion and amortization expense increased $30.4 million to $309.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from
$278.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to an increase in the number of towers and associated intangible assets owned for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to those owned at December 31, 2010.

Operating Income

Operating income increased $36.4 million for year ended December 31, 2011 to $110.7 million compared to $74.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to higher segment operating profit in the site leasing segment offset by increases in depreciation, accretion and amortization expense, and selling, general and administrative expenses.

Other Income (Expense)

Interest income decreased $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010
primarily as a result of a lower amount of investments held during 2011 compared to 2010.

Interest expense for the year ended
December 31, 2011 increased $11.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the higher weighted average amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding driven by an issuance of a new $500.0 million Term Loan in
June 30, 2011. This increase was offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.

Non-cash interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $3.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2010
primarily as a result of accretion of debt discounts using the effective interest method on the 1.875% Notes, the 4.0% Notes, and the Senior Notes, offset by a reduction of accretion due to final payoff of the 0.375% Notes in December of 2010.

The loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 is associated with the
repurchase of $15.0 million of the 1.875% Notes in the first quarter of 2011. The net loss from extinguishment of debt of $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 is associated with the repayment of the outstanding balance of $938.6
million in principal of our 2006 CMBS Certificates.



Net Loss

Net loss was $126.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $194.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net loss decreased in 2011 primarily due to an increase
in site leasing segment operating profit and a decrease in loss from the extinguishment of debt, offset by increases in interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and depreciation, accretion and amortization expense.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SBA Communications Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. SBA Communications’ only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of Telecommunications, which is
also a holding company that owns equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly own all of our domestic and international towers and assets. We conduct all of our business operations through Telecommunications’ subsidiaries.
Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, other than financings, is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries.

A summary of our cash flows is as follows:

Sources of Liquidity

We fund our growth, including our tower portfolio growth, through cash flows from operations, long-term indebtedness and equity issuances. With respect to our debt financing, we have issued secured and
unsecured debt instruments at various levels of our organizational structure to minimize our financing costs while maximizing our operational flexibility.

Cash provided by operating activities was $340.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $249.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due
to an increase in segment operating profit from the site leasing segment partially offset by increased cash interest payments relating to the higher average amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2012,
compared to the same period in the prior year.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we borrowed $584.0 million and
repaid $484.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2012, the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $600.0 million, subject to compliance with financial ratios.



On March 7, 2012, we sold 6,005,000 shares of our Class A common stock at $47.30
per share resulting in proceeds of $283.9 million, net of related fees.

On April 2, 2012, we completed our acquisition
of the equity interests in certain entities affiliated with Mobilitie LLC. In connection with the acquisition, we paid approximately $850 million in cash, which we funded from (i) borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and
(ii) $400 million from a new bridge loan (“Mobilitie Bridge Loan”). Additionally, we issued 5,250,000 shares of our Class A common stock.

On May 9, 2012, we obtained a new $200.0 million senior secured term loan (“2012-1 Term Loan”).

On July 13, 2012, we issued $800 million of our 5.75% unsecured senior notes due July 15, 2020 at par with interest due semi-annually on July 15 and January 15 of each year beginning
on January 15, 2013.

On August 9, 2012, we issued $610 million of the 2012-1 Tower Securities (as defined below)
which have an anticipated repayment date of December 2017 and a final maturity date of December 2042. The fixed coupon interest rate of the 2012-1 Tower Securities is 2.933% per annum, payable monthly.

On September 6, 2012, we sold certain DAS networks located in New York, Chicago and Las Vegas, to ExteNet Systems, Inc. for
approximately $94.3 million in cash and $25 million in the form of a promissory note. On October 23, 2012, an additional DAS network in Auburn, Alabama was sold to ExteNet for cash consideration of $5.7 million.

On September 28, 2012, we issued $500 million of our 5.625% unsecured senior notes due October 1, 2019 at par with interest
payable semi-annually on October 1 and April 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2013.

On September 28,
2012, we obtained a new $300 million 2012-2 Term Loan (as defined below).

On October 1, 2012, the Company, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the acquisition of TowerCo II Holdings LLC, which owned 3,256 tower sites in 47 states across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid $1.2 billion in cash and issued
4,588,840 shares of its Class A common stock.

Registration Statements

We have on file with the Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 registering shares of Class A common stock that we may
issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or antenna sites and related assets or companies who own wireless communication towers, antenna sites or related assets. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we did
not issue any shares of Class A common stock under this registration statement. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 1.7 million shares of Class A common stock remaining under this shelf registration statement.

On February 27, 2012, we filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned
issuers on Form S-3ASR. This registration statement enables us to issue shares of our Class A common stock, preferred stock or debt securities either separately or represented by warrants, or depositary shares as well as units that include any
of these securities. Under the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements, we will file a prospectus supplement and advise the Commission of the amount and type of securities each time we issue securities under this registration
statement. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we issued 6,005,000 shares of our Class A common stock under the automatic shelf registration statement and the prospectus supplement related thereto.

Uses of Liquidity

We
believe that our principal use of liquidity will be to fund tower portfolio growth and, secondarily, to fund our stock repurchase program. In the future, in order to manage our leverage and liquidity positions, we may repurchase, for cash or equity,
our outstanding indebtedness in privately-negotiated or open market transactions in order to optimize our liquidity and leverage and take advantage of market opportunities. If we undertake debt repurchases or exchanges, these actions could
materially impact the amount and composition of indebtedness outstanding or dilute our existing shareholders.



Our cash capital expenditures, including cash used for acquisitions, for the year ended
December 31, 2012 were $2,371.9 million. The $2,371.9 million includes cash capital expenditures of $2,211.8 million that we incurred primarily in connection with the acquisition of 6,630 completed towers, net of related working capital
adjustments and earnouts associated with previous acquisitions. The $2,371.9 million also includes $76.0 million for construction and related costs associated with the completion of 356 new towers during the year ended December 31, 2012 and for
the sites in process at December 31, 2012, $8.6 million for tower maintenance capital expenditures, $24.4 million for augmentations and tower upgrades (of which, $16.7 was recovered from our tenants), $3.7 million for general corporate
expenditures, and $46.9 million for ground lease purchases (excluding $9.7 million spent to extend ground lease terms).

On
April 2, 2012, we completed our acquisition of the equity interests in certain entities affiliated with Mobilitie LLC. In connection with the acquisition, we paid approximately $850 million in cash, which we funded from (i) borrowings
under our Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) $400 million from a new bridge loan (“Mobilitie Bridge Loan”). Additionally, we issued 5,250,000 shares of our Class A common stock.

On April 13, 2012, the proceeds from the equity offering of 6,005,000 shares of our Class A common stock were used to redeem
$131.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.0% Notes and $131.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% Notes and to pay the applicable premium for the redemption.

On May 9, 2012, we used the proceeds from the $200.0 million 2012-1 Term Loan to pay off the outstanding balance on the Revolving
Credit Facility.

On July 13, 2012, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Notes to repay the $400.0
million outstanding balance under the Mobilitie Bridge Loan and to repay the $284.0 million outstanding balance under our Revolving Credit Facility. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

On August 9, 2012, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2012-1 Tower Securities to repay in full the remaining $243.8
million balance of the 8.0% Notes plus $19.0 million in applicable premium and fees associated with early redemption. The remaining net proceeds were used to pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with our acquisition of TowerCo and
for general corporate purposes.

On October 1, 2012, we completed our previously announced acquisition of TowerCo II
Holdings LLC, which owns 3,256 tower sites in 47 states across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid $1.2 billion in cash and issued 4,588,840 shares of our Class A common stock.

In November 2012, we repurchased $66.2 million of aggregate principal balance of the 1.875% Notes for $107.5 million in cash through
multiple transactions.

On December 20, 2012, we acquired 800 freestanding wireless towers in Brazil from Vivo S.A. for
an aggregate purchase price of approximately $175.9 million which was paid on January 4, 2013 from cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we did not repurchase any shares of our Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2012, we had a remaining
authorization to repurchase $150.0 million of Class A common stock under our current $300.0 million stock repurchase program.



In order to manage our leverage and liquidity positions, take advantage of market
opportunities and ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants, we may decide to pursue a variety of other financial transactions. These transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness, the repurchase of our outstanding
indebtedness for cash or equity, selling certain assets or lines of business, issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, or pursuing other financing alternatives, including securitization transactions. If either our
debt repurchases or exchanges or any of the other financial transactions are implemented, these actions could materially impact the amount and composition of indebtedness outstanding, increase our interest expense and/or dilute our existing
shareholders. We cannot assure you that we will not implement any of these strategies or that, if implemented, these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to us and our shareholders.

During 2013, we expect to incur non-discretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate
expenditures of $16.0 million to $21.0 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures, based on current obligations, of $355.0 million to $385.0 million primarily associated with the towers we intend to build in 2013, tower acquisitions closed
or currently under contract, tower augmentations and ground lease purchases. We may spend additional capital in 2013 on acquiring revenue producing or expense reducing assets not yet identified and under contract, or possibly stock repurchases.

We estimate we will incur less than $1,000 per tower per year for non-discretionary maintenance capital improvements related
to our towers. We expect to fund cash capital expenditures from cash on hand, cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors
including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio, our new tower build and tower acquisition programs, and our ground lease purchase program.

Debt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements

Senior Credit Agreement

On February 11, 2010, SBA Senior Finance II, LLC (“SBA Senior Finance II”), an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of our Company, entered into a credit agreement for a $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” formerly referred to as the 2010 Credit Facility) with several banks and other
financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the credit agreement.

On June 30, 2011, SBA Senior
Finance II entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Senior Credit Agreement”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time
parties to the Senior Credit Agreement, to extend the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility, to obtain a new $500.0 million senior secured term loan (the “2011 Term Loan”), and to amend certain terms of the existing credit agreement.
In addition, at the time of entering into the Senior Credit Agreement, the remaining deferred financing fees balance related to the existing Credit Agreement prior to the amendment was transferred to the Revolving Credit Facility in accordance with
accounting guidance for revolving credit facilities.

On April 2, 2012 and again on May 9, 2012, SBA Senior Finance
II exercised its right to increase the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement from $500.0 million to $600.0 million and from $600.0 million to $700.0 million, respectively. We incurred deferred
financing fees of approximately $1.1 million in relation to these increases.

On May 9, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II
entered into a First Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the “First Amendment”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Senior Credit Agreement, to extend the maturity date of
the Revolving Credit Facility to May 9, 2017.



Also on May 9, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II entered into a Second Amendment to the
Senior Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Senior Credit Agreement, to obtain a new $200.0 million senior secured term loan (the
“2012-1 Term Loan”). We incurred financing fees of $2.7 million associated with the closing of this transaction which are being amortized through the maturity date.

On September 28, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II entered into a Third Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”) and Fourth Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the
“Fourth Amendment”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Senior Credit Agreement, to amend certain definitions related to the calculation of leverage at the SBA level to be
consistent with the method for calculating leverage at the SBA Senior Finance II level and to amend the Senior Credit Agreement to permit SBA Senior Finance II, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders
provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans or to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such additional term loans or increases in the Revolving Credit Facility is
subject to its compliance with the conditions set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement.

On September 28, 2012, SBA
Senior Finance II also entered into a Fifth Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Senior Credit Agreement, to
obtain a new $300.0 million senior secured term loan (the “2012-2 Term Loan” collectively with the 2011 Term Loan and the 2012-1 Term Loan, the “Term Loans”). We incurred financing fees of $3.5 million associated with the closing
of this transaction which are being amortized through the maturity date.

On January 28, 2013, SBA Senior Finance II
exercised its right to increase the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility from $700.0 million to $730.0 million.

Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement

The Revolving Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $700.0 million aggregate principal amount as of December 31, 2012 ($730.0 million as of January 28, 2013) may be
borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with specific financial ratios and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus a
margin that ranges from 187.5 basis points to 237.5 basis points or at a Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 87.5 basis points to 137.5 basis points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA,
calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement. If not earlier terminated by SBA Senior Finance II, the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on, and SBA Senior Finance II will repay all amounts outstanding on or before, May 9,
2017. The proceeds available under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. A per annum commitment fee of 0.375% to 0.5% of the unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility is charged based on the ratio of
Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement). SBA Senior Finance II may, from time to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of a period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period. As of December 31, 2012, the amount outstanding of $100 million was accruing interest at
2.335% per annum.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we borrowed $584.0 million and repaid $484.0 million of
the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility using proceeds from the 2012-1 Term Loan and the 5.75% Notes (as defined below). As of December 31, 2012, the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $600.0 million,
subject to compliance with specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing.



Term Loans under the Senior Credit Agreement

The 2011
Term Loan consists of a senior secured term loan in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million and matures on June 30, 2018. The 2011 Term Loan accrues interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either the Base Rate
plus a margin of 175 basis points (with a Base Rate floor of 2%) or Eurodollar Rate plus a margin of 275 basis points (with a Eurodollar Rate floor of 1%). As of December 31, 2012, the 2011 Term Loan was accruing interest at 3.75% per

annum. Having commenced on September 30, 2012, principal of the 2012-1 Term Loan is being repaid in quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December, in an amount equal to $2.5 million for each of the first
eight quarters, $3.75 million for the next four quarters and $5.0 million for each quarter thereafter. SBA Senior Finance II has the ability to prepay any or all amounts under the 2012-1 Term Loan without premium or penalty. To the extent not
previously paid, the 2012-1 Term Loan will be due and payable on the maturity date. The 2012-1 Term Loan was issued at par. We incurred deferred financing fees of approximately $2.7 million in relation to this transaction which are being amortized
through the maturity date. Proceeds from the 2012-1 Term Loan were used to pay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility during the second quarter of 2012.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, We made repayments totaling $5.0 million on the 2012-1 Term Loan. As of December 31, 2012, the 2012-1 Term Loan had a principal balance of $195.0

was accruing interest at 3.75% per annum. Principal of the 2012-2 Term Loan is to be repaid in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing in March 2013, in an aggregate amount equal to
$3.0 million per year. SBA Senior Finance II has the ability to prepay any or all amounts under the 2012-2 Term Loan without premium or penalty, with the exception of a 1% premium if



prepayment occurs during the first year of the loan with proceeds from certain refinancing or repricing transactions. To the extent not previously paid, the 2012-2 Term Loan will be due and
payable on the maturity date. The 2012-2 Term Loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. We incurred deferred financing fees of approximately $3.5 million in relation to this transaction which are being amortized through the maturity date. We used
borrowings under the 2012-2 Term Loan to pay a part of the cash consideration in the TowerCo II Holdings LLC acquisition. The remaining proceeds under the 2012-2 Term Loan were used for general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2012, the 2012-2 Term Loan had a principal balance of $300.0 million.

Terms of the Senior Credit Agreement

The Senior Credit Agreement, as amended, requires SBA Senior Finance II and SBA Communications Corporation (“SBAC”) to maintain specific financial ratios, including, at the SBA Senior Finance II
level, (1) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA not to exceed 6.0 times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt and Net Hedge Exposure (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit
Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.0 times for 30 consecutive days and (3) a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (calculated in accordance with
the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter. In addition, SBAC’s ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) for any fiscal
quarter on an annualized basis cannot exceed 9.5 times. The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of SBA Senior Finance II and its subsidiaries to incur
indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain asset dispositions, including
a sale of all or substantially all of their property. As of December 31, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II and SBAC were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit Agreement. The Senior Credit Agreement is also subject
to customary events of default. Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loans and certain hedging transactions that may be entered into by SBA Senior
Finance II or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, LLC (formerly known as SBA Telecommunications Inc.), SBA
Senior Finance, LLC (formerly known as SBA Senior Finance, Inc.) and SBA Senior Finance II and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real property) of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary
Guarantors.

As of December 31, 2012, the Senior Credit Agreement permits SBA Senior Finance II, without the consent of
the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $700.0 million of which up to $200.0 million may be a Term Loan A, provided that up to $200.0
million of incremental capacity may instead be used to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans is subject
to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement including, with respect to any additional term loan, compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and an increase in
the margin on existing term loans, to the extent required by the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon SBA Senior Finance II’s request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its Revolving
Credit Facility commitment or whether to provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms. On January 28, 2013, $30.0 million of this incremental capacity was committed under the Revolving Credit Facility,
leaving $670 million of total available incremental capacity.



Mobilitie Bridge Loan

Simultaneous with the closing of the Mobilitie acquisition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, SBA Monarch, as borrower, entered into a credit agreement with the several lenders from time to time parties
thereto (the “Bridge Loan Credit Agreement”). Pursuant to the Bridge Loan Credit Agreement, SBA Monarch borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $400 million under a senior secured bridge loan (the “Mobilitie Bridge Loan”). The
Mobilitie Bridge Loan bore interest, at SBA Monarch’s election, at either the Base Rate plus a margin that ranged from 2.00% to 2.50% or the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin that ranged from 3.00% to 3.50%, in each case based on SBA Monarch’s
ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (calculated in accordance with the Bridge Loan Credit Agreement).

On July 13, 2012, we repaid the $400 million principal outstanding under the Mobilitie Bridge Loan from the proceeds of the 5.75% Senior Notes.

Secured Tower Revenue Securities

2010 Tower Securities

On
April 16, 2010, a New York common law trust (the “Trust”), initially formed by our indirect subsidiary, issued $680.0 million of 2010-1 Tower Securities and $550.0 million of 2010-2 Tower Securities (together the “2010 Tower
Securities”). The 2010-1 Tower Securities have an annual interest rate of 4.254% and the 2010-2 Tower Securities have an annual interest rate of 5.101%. The weighted average annual fixed coupon interest rate of the 2010 Tower Securities is
4.7%, including borrowers’ fees, payable monthly. The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2010–1 Tower Securities is April 15, 2015 and April 16, 2040, respectively. The anticipated repayment date and
the final maturity date for the 2010–2 Tower Securities is April 17, 2017 and April 15, 2042, respectively. The sole asset of the Trust consists of a non-recourse mortgage loan made in favor of the Borrowers (as defined below). We
incurred deferred financing fees of approximately $17.9 million in relation to this transaction which are being amortized through the anticipated repayment date of each of the 2010 Tower Securities. Net proceeds from the 2010 Tower Securities were
used to repay in full the outstanding 2006 CMBS Certificates in the amount of $938.6 million and pay the related prepayment consideration plus accrued interest and fees. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

2012-1 Tower Securities

On August 9, 2012, we, through our Trust, issued $610 million of Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2012-1 (the “2012-1 Tower Securities”) which have an anticipated repayment date of
December 15, 2017 and a final maturity date of December 15, 2042. The fixed coupon interest rate of the 2012-1 Tower Securities is 2.933% per annum, payable monthly. A portion of the net proceeds from the 2012-1 Tower Securities were
used to repay in full the remaining $243.8 million balance of the 8.0% Senior Notes due 2016 plus $14.6 million in applicable premium associated with early redemption. The remaining net proceeds were used (1) to pay a portion of the cash
consideration in connection with our acquisition of TowerCo II Holdings LLC and (2) for general corporate purposes.

In
connection with the issuance of the 2012-1 Tower Securities, the parties entered into the Fifth Loan and Security Agreement Supplement and Amendment, dated as of August 9, 2012 (the “Fifth Loan Supplement”), which amended and
supplemented the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of November 18, 2005. The Fifth Loan Supplement was executed by and among SBA Properties, LLC (formerly known as SBA Properties, Inc.), SBA Sites, LLC (formerly known
as SBA Sites, Inc.), and SBA Structures, LLC (formerly known as SBA Structures, Inc.) (the “Initial Borrowers”) and SBA Infrastructure, LLC, SBA Monarch Towers III, LLC and SBA Towers USVI II, Inc. (the “Additional Borrowers” and
together with the Initial Borrowers, the “Borrowers”) and other parties. Pursuant to the Fifth Loan Supplement, the Additional Borrowers were added as obligors under the mortgage loan and, with the Initial Borrowers, became jointly and
severally liable for the aggregate $1.84 billion borrowed under the mortgage loan corresponding to the 2010 Tower Securities and 2012-1 Tower Securities.



Tower Revenue Securities Terms

The mortgage loan underlying the 2010 Tower Securities and the 2012-1 Tower Securities (together the “Tower Securities”) will be
paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 5,152 tower sites owned by the Borrowers. The mortgage loan is secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower sites, (ii) a
security interest in the towers and substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (iii) the Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases, and (iv) all of the proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar
month, SBA Network Management, Inc., our indirect subsidiary, is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 7.5% of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.

The Borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (i) within nine
months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2010 Tower Securities) or twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2012-1 Tower Securities) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component,
(ii) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower site owned by the Borrowers or (iii) during an amortization period. In all other circumstances, the Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole
or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. The prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the Tower Securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of (1) the present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid, calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement, on the date of prepayment of all future
installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date within nine months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2010 Tower Securities) or twelve months (in the
case of the component corresponding to the 2012-1 Tower Securities) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment.

To the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their
respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (i) 5% and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the
credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.

Pursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the tower sites owned by the Borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are
held by the indenture trustee. The monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 4). However, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, defined as the net cash
flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter,
falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents,
referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds
1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be
applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. In addition, if either the 2010-1 Tower Securities, 2010-2 Tower Securities or the 2012-1 Tower Securities are not fully
repaid



by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the tower sites owned by the Borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the Tower Securities and applied first to repay the
interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the Tower Securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those tower sites, third to pay the management fees due to SBA
Network Management, Inc., fourth to repay principal of the Tower Securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above. The mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated
securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. As of December 31, 2012, the Borrowers met the required Debt Service Coverage Ratio as
set forth in the mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants.

1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013

As of December 31, 2012, we had $468.8 million outstanding of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “1.875%
Notes”) which were recorded at their discounted carrying value of $457.4 million. The maturity date of the 1.875% Notes is May 1, 2013, and as such they are included in current maturities of long term debt in current liabilities. Interest
on the 1.875% Notes is payable semi-annually each May 1 and November 1. The 1.875% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of our Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 24.1196 shares of
Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $41.46 per share or a 20% conversion premium based on the last reported sale
price of $34.55 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2008, the purchase agreement date. Effective February 4, 2013, we elected to settle all of our conversion obligations pursuant to the
Indenture governing the 1.875% Notes in cash.

During the first quarter of 2011, we repurchased $15.0 million of the 1.875%
Notes resulting in a principal balance of $535.0 million. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2012, we repurchased $66.2 million of the aggregate principal balance of the 1.875% Notes for $107.5 million in cash.

Concurrently with the pricing of our 1.875% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with
affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1.875% Notes is $41.46 per share of our Class A common stock (the same as the
initial conversion price of our 1.875% Notes) and the upper strike price of the warrants is $67.37 per share. Although we initially entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions to cover the full amount of the shares that were
issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes, as a result of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (“Lehman Derivatives”), on November 7, 2008, we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman
Derivatives which covered 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of our Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our 1.875% Notes. Consequently, we do not currently have a hedge with respect to those shares and, to the extent that the
market price of our Class A common stock exceeds $41.46 per share upon conversion of the notes, we will be subject to dilution, or if we settle in cash, additional costs, upon conversion of that portion of the 1.875% Notes.

During the year ended 2012, we received partial settlements of $4.9 million relating to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and its affiliated debtors related to the Lehman Derivatives. The amounts received were recorded as a gain in other income in the statement of operations and reflected as an inflow of cash from financing activities in the statement of
cash flow.

4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014

As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding $500.0 million of our 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes (the “4.0% Notes”) which were recorded at their discounted carrying value of $430.8 million.
The maturity date of the 4.0% Notes is October 1, 2014. Interest on the 4.0% Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1.



The 4.0% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of our Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 32.9164 shares of our Class A common stock per
$1,000 principal amount of 4.0% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $30.38 per share or a 22.5% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $24.80 per
share of our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on April 20, 2009, the purchase agreement date.

Concurrently with the pricing of our 4.0% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with
affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 4.0% Notes is $30.38 per share of our Class A common stock (the same as the
initial conversion price of the 4.0% Notes) and the upper strike price of the warrant transactions is $44.64 per share.

Convertible
Senior Notes Conversion Options

The 1.875% Notes and 4.0% Notes (collectively “the Notes”) are convertible only under the
following circumstances:

•

during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of Class A common stock on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter,

•

during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes
for each day in the measurement period was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate,

•

if specified distributions to holders of Class A common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur, and

•

at any time on or after February 19, 2013 for the 1.875% Notes and July 22, 2014 for the 4.0% Notes.

Upon conversion, we have the right to settle our conversion obligation in cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of
cash and shares of our Class A common stock. From time to time, upon notice to the holders of the Notes, we may change our election regarding the form of consideration that we will use to settle our conversion obligation; provided, however,
that we are not permitted to change its settlement election after February 18, 2013 for the 1.875% Notes and July 21, 2014 for the 4.0% Notes. As of February 4, 2013, we had elected to settle 100% of our conversion obligation pursuant
to the Indenture governing the 1.875% Notes in cash.

At the end of the first quarter of 2012 the 4.0% Notes became
convertible by the note holders because our Class A common stock closing price per share exceeded $39.49 for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on March 31, 2012. During each of the second, third,
and fourth quarters, the 4.0% Notes remained convertible by the note holders. The 4.0% Notes will continue to be convertible through March 31, 2013, and will still be convertible thereafter, if one or more of the conversion conditions specified
in the Indenture, dated as of April 24, 2009, are satisfied during future measurement periods. During 2012, we received 5 conversion notices totaling 17 notes valued at $1,000 per note. A portion of these notes were settled in shares of our
Class A common stock and cash for fractional shares during the fourth quarter of 2012. The remaining portion is expected to settle during the first quarter of 2013.



At the end of the third quarter of 2012, the conversion right for the 1.875% Notes was
triggered because our Class A common stock closing price per share exceeded $53.90 for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on September 30, 2012. The 1.875% Notes remained convertible by the
noteholders as of December 31, 2012. During 2012, we received 8 conversion notices totaling 5,314 notes valued at $1,000 per note. A portion of these notes were settled in shares of our Class A common stock and cash for fractional shares
during the fourth quarter of 2012. The remaining portion is expected to settle during the first quarter of 2013. Furthermore, during the first quarter of 2013, we received 4 conversion notices totaling 12,810 notes valued at $1,000 per note. These
notes will be settled in shares of our Class A common stock and cash for fractional shares during the first and second quarter of 2013.

Senior Notes

8.0% Senior
Notes and 8.25% Senior Notes

On July 24, 2009, Telecommunications issued $750.0 million of unsecured senior notes
(the “Senior Notes”), $375.0 million of which were due August 15, 2016 (the “8.0% Notes”) and $375.0 million of which were due August 15, 2019 (the “8.25% Notes”). The 8.0% Notes had an interest rate of

semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we redeemed the full $375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.0% Notes and $131.3
million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% Notes and paid the applicable premium for the redemption. The 8.25% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by SBAC.

5.75% Senior Notes

On July 13, 2012, we issued $800.0 million of
unsecured senior notes (the “5.75% Notes”) due July 15, 2020. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 5.75% and were issued at par. Interest on the 5.75% Notes is due semi-annually on July 15 and January 15 of each year
beginning on January 15, 2013. We used the net proceeds from this offering to (1) repay all amounts outstanding under the Mobilitie Bridge Loan and (2) repay all amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. The remaining
proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

In connection with the issuance of the 5.75% Notes, we entered into a
Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representative of the Initial Purchasers. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to use our respective
reasonable best efforts to file and have declared effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the 5.75% Notes for new notes guaranteed by us registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), on or prior to July 8, 2013. If we fail to satisfy certain filings and other obligations with respect to the exchange, we will be obligated to pay additional interest of 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period and an
additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period thereafter, until our registration obligations are fulfilled, up to a maximum of 1.00% per annum.

5.625% Senior Notes

On September 28, 2012, we issued $500.0 million
of unsecured senior notes (the “5.625% Notes”) due October 1, 2019. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 5.625% and were issued at par. Interest on the 5.625% Notes is due semi-annually on October 1 and April 1 of each
year beginning on April 1, 2013. We used the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.625% Notes to pay a portion of the cash consideration in the TowerCo II Holdings LLC acquisition.



In connection with the issuance of the 5.625% Notes, we entered into a Registration Rights
Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representative of the Initial Purchasers. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to file
and have declared effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the 5.625% Notes for new notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), on or prior to September 23,
2013. If we fail to satisfy certain filings and other obligations with respect to the exchange, we will be obligated to pay additional interest of 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period and an additional 0.25% per annum with respect
to each subsequent 90-day period thereafter, until our registration obligations are fulfilled, up to a maximum of 1.00% per annum.

Debt Service

As of
December 31, 2012, we believe that our cash on hand, capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility and our cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve
months.

The following table illustrates our estimate of our debt service requirement over the next twelve months based on the
amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and the interest rates accruing on those amounts on such date (in thousands):

Inflation

The impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. However, we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results
particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation.



Commitments and Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of December 31, 2012:

(1)

Represents interest payments based on the 2010-1 Tower Securities interest rate of 4.254%, the 2010-2 Tower Securities interest rate of 5.1010%, the 2012-1 Tower
Securities interest rate of 2.933%, the Revolving Credit Facility interest rate of 2.335% as of December 31, 2012, the 2011 Term Loan at an interest rate of 3.750% as of December 31, 2012, 2012-1 Term Loan at an interest rate of 2.470% as
of December 31, 2012, 2012-2 Term Loan at an interest rate of 3.750% as of December 31, 2012, the Convertible Senior Notes interest rate of 1.875% and 4.0%, and the Senior Notes interest rate of 8.25%, 5.625%, and 5.750%.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These instruments arise from
transactions entered into in the normal course of business.

The following table presents the future principal payment
obligations and fair values associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of December 31, 2012:

(1)

Amounts set forth reflect the principal amount of the relevant convertible notes and do not reflect the total obligations that may be due on the convertible notes if
they are converted prior to their maturity date. As of December 31, 2012, both the 1.875% Notes and the 4.0% Notes are convertible pursuant to the terms of their applicable indenture.

(2)

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2010-1 Tower Securities is April 15, 2015 and April 16, 2040, respectively. The anticipated
repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2010-2 Tower Securities is April 17, 2017 and April 15, 2042, respectively. The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2012-1 Tower Securities is December 15,
2017 and December 15, 2042, respectively.

Our current primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk
relating to (1) our ability to meet financial covenants and (2) the impact of interest rate movements on our 2011 Term Loan, 2012-1 Term Loan, 2012-2 Term Loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our Revolving Credit Facility, which
are at floating rates. We manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt. While we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our
existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis. In addition, in connection with our convertible notes, we are subject to market risk associated with the market price of our common stock.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures –

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2012, an evaluation was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO
concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting –

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of SBA; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of SBA are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of SBA; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of SBA’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.

Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of SBA’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 based upon criteria in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management
determined that SBA’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012 based on the criteria in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered certified public accounting firm that
audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on SBA’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries

We have audited SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO
criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 27, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), SBA Communications
Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements is as follows:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the Company and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made by management relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the costs and revenue relating to the Company’s construction contracts, stock-based compensation assumptions,
valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, fair value of long-lived assets, the useful lives of towers and intangible assets, anticipated property tax assessments, fair value of investments and asset retirement obligations. Management
develops estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available. These estimates ultimately may differ from actual results and such differences could
be material.

F-10


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash in banks, money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities with an
original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Investments

Investment securities with original maturities of more
than three months but less than one year at time of purchase are considered short-term investments. The Company’s short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of less than a year. Investment securities
with maturities of more than a year are considered long-term investments and are classified in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Long-term investments primarily consist of U.S. Treasuries, mutual funds, and preferred
securities. Gross purchases and sales of the Company’s investments are presented within “Cash flows from investing activities” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company accounts for its equity investments in privately held companies under the cost method. The aggregate carrying value of
the Company’s cost-method investments was approximately $51.7 million and $48.2 million as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 respectively, and is classified within other assets on the Company’s condensed consolidated
balance sheets.

The Company evaluates its cost-method investments for impairment at least annually. The Company determines the
fair value of its cost-method investments by considering available evidence, including general market conditions, the investee’s financial condition, near-term prospects, market comparables and subsequent rounds of financing. The Company
measures and records its cost-method investments at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company did not recognize any impairment loss during the years ended December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011,
and December 31, 2010.

Restricted Cash

The Company classifies all cash pledged as collateral to secure certain obligations and all cash whose use is limited as restricted cash.
This includes cash held in escrow to fund certain reserve accounts relating to the Tower Securities as well as for payment and performance bonds and surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company in the ordinary course of business (see Note 4).

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost or at estimated fair value (in the case of acquired properties), adjusted for asset impairment and estimated asset retirement obligations. Costs associated with
the development and construction of towers are capitalized as a cost of the towers. Costs for self-constructed towers include direct materials and labor, indirect costs and capitalized interest. Approximately $0.3 million, $0.5 million, and $0.4
million of interest cost was capitalized in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Depreciation on towers and related components
is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, not to exceed the minimum lease term of the underlying ground lease. The Company defines the minimum lease term as the shorter of the period from lease inception through the
end of the term of all tenant lease obligations in existence at ground lease inception, including renewal periods, or the ground lease term, including renewal periods. If no tenant lease obligation exists at the date of ground lease inception, the
initial term of the ground lease is considered the minimum lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the minimum lease term of the lease. For all other
property and equipment, depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.

F-11


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company performs ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of its property
and equipment for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset. If the useful lives of assets are reduced, depreciation
may be accelerated in future years. Property and equipment under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or the remaining estimated life of the leased property, whichever is shorter, and the related
amortization is included in depreciation expense. Expenditures for maintenance and repair are expensed as incurred.

Asset
classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows:

Betterments, improvements and significant repairs, which increase the value or extend the life of an
asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset. Changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively, with the book value of the asset at the time of the change
being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life. There has been no material impact for changes in estimated useful lives for any years presented.

Deferred Financing Fees

Financing fees related to the issuance of
debt have been deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the expected length of related indebtedness (see Note 13).

Deferred Lease Costs

The Company defers certain initial direct
costs associated with the origination of tenant leases and lease amendments and amortizes these costs over the initial lease term or over the lease term remaining if related to a lease amendment. Such deferred costs were approximately $10.2 million,
$5.1 million, and $4.7 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Amortization expense was $4.6 million, $4.6 million, and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is included in cost of site
leasing on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, unamortized deferred lease costs were $15.6 million and $9.9 million, respectively, and are included in other assets on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Intangible Assets

The Company classifies as intangible assets the fair value of current leases in place at the acquisition date of towers and related assets
(referred to as the “Current contract intangibles”), and the fair value of future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the acquired towers (referred to as the “Network location intangibles”). These intangibles are estimated
to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related tower assets, which is typically 15 years. For all intangible assets, amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as the benefit
associated with these intangible assets is anticipated to be derived evenly over the life of the asset.

F-12


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates its individual long-lived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an
impairment analysis should be performed. The Company evaluates its tower assets and Current contract intangibles at the tower level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists. The Company evaluates its Network location
intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present. The Company has established a policy to at least annually evaluate its tower assets and Current contract intangibles for impairment.

The Company records an impairment charge when the Company believes an investment in towers or related assets has been
impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site and related intangible. Estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not
limited to, general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, the Company makes certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value
for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $6.4 million, $5.5 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair market values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease
agreements, which are generally five to ten years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred
revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Site development projects in which the Company performs consulting services
include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which the Company performs work on a
fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, the Company recognizes the revenue
related to that phase. Site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete.

F-13


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method
of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on
the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted
contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts,” included within other current liabilities on the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

On October 31, 2011, the Company entered into a Master Amendment with one of its wireless service provider customers.
The Master Amendment serves as a separate amendment to each individual existing tenant lease agreement that the Company is currently a party to with that customer. Among other items, the Master Amendment (1) extends the current term of the
individual leases, (2) permits the customer limited early termination rights which will be exercisable over a multi-year period, commencing in the second half of 2013, on a specific number of the existing leases, (3) allows the customer to
make certain specific equipment changes at the tower sites in exchange for an increase in monthly rental payment due from the customer, and (4) slightly modifies the existing monthly lease rates of certain leases. The customer’s early
termination rights are limited with respect to the aggregate number of leases that may be terminated and the number that may be terminated in any quarter. The specific leases to be terminated early and the timing of such terminations has not been
determined as of the date of this filing. As a result, for accounting and financial statement purposes, the Company has made assumptions with regard to the leases to be terminated and the timing of the terminations. The Company has assumed that the
customer will terminate the maximum number of leases allowable in each quarter, selecting the highest rental rate leases at the earliest allowable dates. The Company believes that these assumptions will ensure that only the minimum known revenue for
the pool of leases covered by the Master Agreement will be accrued on a straight-line basis. The Company’s balance sheet and statement of operations reflect these assumptions. The actual leases that the customer terminates and the timing and
number of terminations may or may not be those that we have identified in our assumptions. The Company will monitor actual results and elections under the Master Amendment and record any differences from previously made assumptions on a quarterly
basis. To the extent that the actual results materially differ from the assumptions made, the Company will disclose the impact of these adjustments.

Allowance for Doubtful accounts

The Company performs periodic
credit evaluations of its customers. The Company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past
due balances as determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. Amounts
determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable.

The following is a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010;

Cost of Revenue

Cost of site leasing revenue includes ground lease rent, property taxes, maintenance and other tower operating expenses. All ground lease
rental obligations due to be paid out over the lease term, including fixed escalations, are recorded on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. Liabilities recorded related to the straight-lining of ground leases are reflected in other
long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of site development revenue includes the cost of materials, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly
related to the projects. All costs related to site development projects are recognized as incurred.

Income Taxes

The Company had taxable losses during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, and as a result, net
operating loss carry-forwards have been generated. The majority of these net operating loss carry-forwards are fully reserved as management believes it is not “more-likely-than-not” that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income
in future periods to recognize the losses. The tax years 1997 through 2011 remain open to examination by the major jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

The Company determines whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position taken in an income tax return will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or
litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the
financial statements. The Company has not identified any tax exposures that require a reserve. In the future, to the extent that the Company records unrecognized tax exposures, any related interest and penalties will be recognized as interest
expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company does not calculate U.S. taxes on
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures and recognizes
compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. The Company records compensation expense, net
of estimated forfeitures, for stock options and restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense for employee stock options is based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of the grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Any stock options granted to non-employees would be valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the market price of the underlying common stock on the “valuation date,” which
for options to non-employees is the vesting date. Expense related to options granted to non-employees would be recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period.
Compensation expense for restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of the units awarded at the date of the grant.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company has entered into ground leases for the land underlying the majority of the Company’s towers. A majority of these leases
require the Company to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of the ground lease.

The Company
recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and accretes such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets, and over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of
the tower.

The asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $7.5 million and $5.4
million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon settlement of the obligations, any difference between the cost to retire an asset and the recorded liability is recorded in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain or loss. In determining the impact of the asset retirement obligations, the Company considered the nature and scope of the contractual restoration obligations contained in the Company’s third
party ground leases, the historical retirement experience as an indicator of future restoration probabilities, intent in renewing existing ground leases through lease termination dates, current and future value and timing of estimated restoration
costs and the credit adjusted risk-free rate used to discount future obligations.

The following summarizes the activity of
the asset retirement obligation liability:

Loss Per Share

The Company has potential common stock equivalents related to its outstanding stock options and convertible senior notes. These potential common stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per
share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive in calculating the full year earnings per share. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share and the weighted average number of shares used in the computations are the same for all
periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, and is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).

Foreign Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries that do not utilize the United States dollar as its functional currency are translated at period-end rates of exchange, while revenues and expenses are translated at monthly weighted average rates of exchange for the year. Unrealized
translation gains and losses are reported as foreign currency translation adjustments through other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year.

Acquisitions

The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of
operations of the acquired assets are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. The Company continues to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each
transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the
acquisition date (“Current contract Intangibles”) and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the towers (“Network location intangibles”) and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected
cash flows. The intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related tower assets, which is typically 15 years.

In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company may agree to pay additional consideration (or earnouts) if the towers or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a
period of one to three years after they have been acquired. The Company records contingent consideration for acquisitions that occurred prior to January 1, 2009 when the contingent consideration is paid. Effective January 1, 2009, the
Company accrues for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. All subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recorded through Consolidated Statements of
Operations. In certain acquisitions, the additional consideration may be paid in cash or shares of Class A common stock at the Company’s option.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

— The Company’s earnouts related to
acquisitions are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs. The Company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and any subsequent changes in fair value, using a discounted
probability-weighted approach, as determined using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the earnouts is reviewed quarterly and is based on the payments the Company expects to make based on historical internal observations related to the anticipated
performance of the underlying assets. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of its obligation if the performance targets contained in various acquisition agreements were met was $9.8 million and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively, which the Company recorded in accrued expenses on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

—The Company’s long-lived assets (see Note 2), intangibles
and asset retirement obligations (see Note 2) are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs. Level 3 valuations rely on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if
any, market activity for the asset or liability. The Company considers many factors and makes certain assumptions when making this assessment, including but not limited to: general market and economic conditions, historical operating results,
geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. The fair value of the long-lived assets, intangibles and asset retirement obligations is calculated using a discounted cash flow model.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

—The carrying values of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, and short-term investments, which consist of $5.3 million and $5.6 million in certificate of deposits, as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively,
approximate their related estimated fair values due to the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of its investments in treasury and corporate bonds, including current portion, are based primarily upon
Level 1 reported market values. As of the date ending December 31, 2012, the carrying value and fair value of the held-to-maturity investments, including current portion, was $1.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively. As of the date ending
December 31, 2011, the carrying value and fair value of the held-to-maturity investments, including current portion, was $1.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

The Company determines fair value of its debt instruments utilizing various Level 2 sources including quoted prices and indicative quotes (non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to
interpret market information including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices. The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility is considered to be equal to the carrying value because the interest payments
are based on Eurodollar rates that reset every month. The Company does not believe its credit risk has changed materially from the date the applicable Eurodollar Rate plus 187.5 basis points was set for the Revolving Credit Facility. The following
table reflects fair values, principal balances and carrying values of the Company’s debt instruments (see Note 13).

RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash consists of the following:

Pursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities (see Note 13), the Company is required to establish a
securitization escrow account, held by the indenture trustee, into which all rents and other sums due on the towers that secure the Tower Securities are directly deposited by the lessees. These restricted cash amounts are used to fund reserve
accounts for the payment of (1) debt service costs, (2) ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums related to tower sites, (3) trustee and servicing expenses, (4) management fees, and (5) to
reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants. The restricted cash in the controlled deposit account in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 13) monthly, provided that the Borrowers are
in compliance with their debt service coverage ratio and that no Event of Default has occurred. All monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Payment and performance bonds relate primarily to collateral requirements for tower construction currently in process by the Company.
Cash is pledged as collateral related to surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business and primarily related to the Company’s tower removal obligations. As of December 31, 2012, the
Company had $35.1 million in surety, payment and performance bonds for which it is only required to post $10.5 million in collateral. The Company periodically evaluates the collateral posted for its bonds to ensure that it meets the minimum
requirements. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had pledged $2.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively, as collateral related to its workers compensation policy. Restricted cash for surety bonds and workers compensation are
included in other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Senior Credit Agreement

On February 11, 2010, SBA Senior Finance II, LLC (“SBA Senior Finance II”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement for a $500.0 million senior
secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” formerly referred to as the 2010 Credit Facility) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the credit agreement.

On June 30, 2011, SBA Senior Finance II entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, supplemented,
or modified from time to time, the “Senior Credit Agreement”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Senior Credit Agreement, to extend the maturity of the Revolving Credit
Facility, to obtain a new $500.0 million senior secured term loan (the “2011 Term Loan”), and to amend certain terms of the existing credit agreement. In addition, at the time of entering into the Senior Credit Agreement, the remaining
deferred financing fees balance related to the existing Credit Agreement prior to the amendment was transferred to the Revolving Credit Facility in accordance with accounting guidance for revolving credit facilities.

On April 2, 2012 and again on May 9, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II exercised its right to increase the aggregate principal amount
of the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement from $500.0 million to $600.0 million and from $600.0 million to $700.0 million, respectively. The Company incurred deferred financing fees of approximately $1.1 million in relation
to these increases.

On May 9, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II entered into a first amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement
(the “First Amendment”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Senior Credit Agreement, to extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to May 9, 2017.

“2012-1 Term Loan”). The Company incurred financing fees of $2.7 million associated with the closing of this transaction which are being amortized through the maturity date.

On September 28, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II entered into a third amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the “Third
Amendment”) and fourth amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment”) with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Senior Credit Agreement, to amend certain
definitions related to the calculation of leverage at the SBA level to be consistent with the method for calculating leverage at the SBA Senior Finance II level and to amend the Senior Credit Agreement to permit SBA Senior Finance II, without
the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans or to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such
additional term loans or increases in the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to its compliance with the conditions set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement.

On September 28, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II also entered into a fifth amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”) with several banks and other financial institutions
or entities from time to time parties to the Senior Credit Agreement, to obtain a new $300.0 million senior secured term loan (the “2012-2 Term Loan” collectively with the 2011 Term Loans and 2012-1 Term Loan, the “Term Loans”).
The Company incurred financing fees of $3.5 million associated with the closing of this transaction which are being amortized through the maturity date.

On January 28, 2013, SBA Senior Finance II exercised its right to increase the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility from $700.0 million to $730.0 million.

Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement

The Revolving Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $700.0 million aggregate principal amount as of December 31, 2012 ($730.0 million as of January 28, 2013) may be
borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with specific financial ratios and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus a
margin that ranges from 187.5 basis points to 237.5 basis points or at a Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 87.5 basis points to 137.5 basis points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA,
calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement. If not earlier terminated by SBA Senior Finance II, the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on, and SBA Senior Finance II will repay all amounts outstanding on or before, May 9,
2017. The proceeds available under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. A per annum commitment fee of 0.375% to 0.5% of the unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility is charged based on the ratio of
Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement). SBA Senior Finance II may, from time to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of a period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period. As of December 31, 2012, the amount outstanding of $100 million was accruing interest at
2.335% per annum.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II borrowed $584.0 million and repaid
$484.0 million of the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility using proceeds from the 2012-1 Term Loan and the 5.75% Notes (as defined below). As of December 31, 2012, the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was
$600.0 million, subject to compliance with specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing.

SBA Senior Finance II and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates,
and engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of their property. As of December 31, 2012, SBA Senior Finance II and SBAC were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit
Agreement. The Senior Credit Agreement is also subject to customary events of default. Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loans and certain hedging
transactions that may be entered into by SBA Senior Finance II or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, LLC
(formerly known as SBA Telecommunications Inc.), SBA Senior Finance, LLC (formerly known as SBA Senior Finance, Inc.) and SBA Senior Finance II and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real
property) of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary Guarantors.

permits SBA Senior Finance II, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $700.0 million of which up to $200.0
million may be a Term Loan A, provided that up to $200.0 million of incremental capacity may instead be used to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such increases in the
Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans is subject to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement including, with respect to any additional term loan, compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the
financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and an increase in the margin on existing term loans, to the extent required by the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon SBA Senior Finance II’s request, each lender may decide, in its sole
discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Facility commitment or whether to provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms. On January 28, 2013, $30.0 million of this
incremental capacity was committed under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $670.0 million of total available incremental capacity.

date of December 15, 2017 and a final maturity date of December 15, 2042. The fixed coupon interest rate of the 2012-1 Tower Securities is 2.933% per annum, payable monthly. A portion of the net proceeds from the 2012-1 Tower

the cash consideration in connection with SBA’s acquisition of TowerCo II Holdings LLC and (2) for general corporate purposes.

In connection with the issuance of the 2012-1 Tower Securities, the parties entered into the Fifth Loan and Security Agreement Supplement and Amendment, dated as of August 9, 2012 (the “Fifth
Loan Supplement”), which amended and supplemented the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of November 18, 2005. The Fifth Loan Supplement was executed by and among SBA Properties, LLC (formerly known as SBA
Properties, Inc.), SBA Sites, LLC (formerly known as SBA Sites, Inc.), and SBA Structures, LLC (formerly known as SBA Structures, Inc.) (the “Initial Borrowers”) and SBA Infrastructure, LLC, SBA Monarch Towers III, LLC and SBA Towers USVI
II, Inc. (the “Additional Borrowers” and together with the Initial Borrowers, the “Borrowers”) and other parties. Pursuant to the Fifth Loan Supplement, the Additional Borrowers were added as obligors under the mortgage loan and,
with the Initial Borrowers, became jointly and severally liable for the aggregate $1.84 billion borrowed under the mortgage loan corresponding to the 2010 Tower Securities and 2012-1 Tower Securities.

Tower Revenue Securities Terms

The mortgage loan underlying the 2010 Tower Securities and the 2012-1 Tower Securities (together the “Tower Securities”) will be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 5,152 tower
sites owned by the Borrowers. The mortgage loan is secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower sites, (ii) a security interest in the towers and substantially all of the
Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (iii) the Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases, and (iv) all of the proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar month, SBA Network Management, Inc., the Company’s indirect
subsidiary, is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 7.5% of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.

The Borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (i) within nine months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2010
Tower Securities) or twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2012-1 Tower Securities) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component, (ii) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or
casualty of any tower site owned by the Borrowers or (iii) during an amortization period. In all other circumstances, the Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration.
The prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the Tower Securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value associated with the
portion of the principal balance being prepaid, calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement, on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of
prepayment to and including the first due date within nine months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2010 Tower Securities) or twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2012-1 Tower Securities) of the
anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the Tower Securities
are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (i) 5% and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year U.S. treasury rate
plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.

Pursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the tower sites owned by the Borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are
held by the indenture trustee. The monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 4). However, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, defined as
the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any
calendar quarter, falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under
the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the Debt Service
Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the
reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. In addition, if either the 2010-1 Tower Securities, 2010-2 Tower Securities, or the 2012-1 Tower
Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the tower sites owned by the Borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the Tower Securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the
original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the Tower Securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those tower sites, third to pay the management fees due to SBA Network Management,
Inc., fourth to repay principal of the Tower Securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above. The mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. Among
other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. As of December 31, 2012, the Borrowers met the required Debt Service Coverage Ratio as set forth in the
mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants.

1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013

On May 16, 2008, the Company issued $550.0 million of its 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “1.875% Notes”). Interest is
payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1, and the Notes mature on May 1, 2013. The Company incurred fees of $12.9 million with the issuance of the 1.875% Notes of which $9.1 million was recorded as deferred financing fees and
$3.8 million was recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity.

The Notes are convertible, at the holder’s
option, into shares of our Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 24.1196 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately $41.46 per share or a 20% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $34.55 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2008, the purchase

million in cash.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 1.875% Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge
transactions and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible notes. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to the 1.875% Notes is $41.46 per share of the
Company’s Class A common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 1.875% convertible notes) and the upper strike price of the warrants is $67.37 per share. Although the Company initially entered into convertible note hedge
and warrant transactions to cover the full amount of the shares that were issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes, as a result of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (“Lehman Derivatives”), on November 7, 2008,
the Company terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives which covered 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes. Consequently,
the Company does not currently have a hedge with respect to those shares and, to the extent that the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeds $41.46 per share upon conversion of the notes, the Company will be subject to
dilution or if the Company settles in cash, additional costs, upon conversion of that portion of the 1.875% Notes.

The
Company is amortizing the debt discount on the 1.875% Notes utilizing the effective interest method over the life of the 1.875% Notes which increases the effective interest rate of the 1.875% Notes from its coupon rate of 1.875% to 9.351%. As of
December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of the equity component related to the 1.875% Notes was $115.0 million.

The
1.875% Notes are reflected in long-term debt in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at carrying value. The following table summarizes the balances for the 1.875% Notes:

SBA Communications Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own and its only significant asset is the
outstanding capital stock of Telecommunications. Telecommunications is 100% owned by SBA Communications Corporation. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes issued by Telecommunications.

On July 15, 2010, Telecommunications and the Company consummated an exchange offer pursuant to which outstanding unregistered notes
of each series of the Senior Notes were exchanged for registered notes of the respective series.

5.75% Senior Notes

On July 13, 2012, Telecommunications issued $800.0 million of unsecured senior notes (the “5.75% Notes”) due July 15,
2020. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 5.75% and were issued at par. Interest on the 5.75% Notes is due semi-annually on July 15 and January 15 of each year beginning on January 15, 2013. The Company incurred deferred financing
fees of approximately $13.9 million in relation to this transaction which are being amortized through the maturity date. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to (1) repay all amounts outstanding under the Mobilitie Bridge Loan
and (2) repay all amounts outstanding under its Revolving Credit Facility. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

In connection with the issuance of the 5.75% Notes, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as
representative of the Initial Purchasers. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company and Telecommunications agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to file and have declared effective a registration
statement with respect to an offer to exchange the 5.75% Notes for new notes guaranteed by the Company registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), on or prior to July 8, 2013. If the Company fails
to satisfy certain filing and other obligations with respect to the exchange, the Company will be obligated to pay additional interest of 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period and an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each
subsequent 90-day period thereafter, until the Company’s registration obligations are fulfilled, up to a maximum of 1.00% per annum.

The 5.75% Notes are subject to redemption in whole or in part on or after July 15, 2016 at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

2006 CMBS Certificate Swaps

During 2006, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into nine forward-starting swap agreements (the “2006 CMBS Certificate Swaps”) in anticipation of the 2006 CMBS
Transaction. In October 2006, the Company terminated the 2006 CMBS Certificate Swaps in connection with entering into the purchase and sale agreement for the 2006 CMBS Certificates (see Note 13). The Company determined a portion of the swaps to be
an effective cash flow hedge and as a result, recorded a deferred loss of $12.8 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred loss was being amortized
utilizing the effective interest method over the anticipated five year life of the 2006 CMBS Certificates and increased the effective interest rate on these certificates by 0.3%. On April 16, 2010, the Company wrote-off the remaining
unamortized deferred loss of $3.6 million in connection with the repayment of the 2006 CMBS Certificates (see Note 13).

The
Company recorded amortization of $0.6 million as non-cash interest expense on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.

15.

REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

In connection with the Company’s business operations in Canada and Central America, the Company entered into
agreements with non-affiliated joint venture partners that contain both a put option for its partners and a call option for the Company, requiring or allowing the Company, in certain circumstances, to purchase the remaining interest in such entity
at a price based on predetermined earnings multiples. Each of these options is triggered upon the occurrence of specified events and/or upon the passage of time. During 2011, the Company paid approximately $0.7 million to purchase the outstanding
4.6% interest in the Canadian joint venture increasing the Company’s interest in that joint venture to 100%. The put right in the Central American joint venture may be exercised after a certain date causing the Company to purchase the
partner’s equity interests (the “Redemption Amount”) based on a formula defined in the joint venture agreement. None of these options are currently exercisable by either the Company or its partners. The noncontrolling interest is
classified as a redeemable equity interest in mezzanine (or temporary equity) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company allocates income and losses to the noncontrolling interest holder based on the applicable membership interest percentage. After applying those provisions, the Company calculates the redemption
amount at each reporting period and records the amount, if any, by which the redemption amount exceeds the book value as a charge against income (loss) available to common shareholders.

In December 2010, the Company acquired an additional 10% interest in the Central American joint venture for consideration of $7.5
million. This acquisition increased the Company’s ownership to 90% of the joint venture. The acquisition of the noncontrolling interest has been reflected as a reduction of additional-paid-in capital in accordance with ASC 810.

As of December 31, 2012 the redeemable noncontrolling interest presented on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet represents
the estimated fair value of the amount the Company could be required to pay to redeem the noncontrolling interest at the date of the exercise of either the put or the call option.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Common Stock equivalents

The Company has potential common stock equivalents related to its outstanding stock options (see Note 17), restricted stock units, the 1.875% Notes and the 4.0% Notes (see Note 13). These potential common
stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share and the
weighted average number of shares used in the computation are the same for the years presented.

Stock Repurchases

The Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program on April 27, 2011. This program authorizes the Company to purchase, from time to time, up to $300.0 million of the
Company’s outstanding Class A common stock through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and/or in privately negotiated transactions at management’s discretion based
on market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. This program became effective on April 28, 2011 and will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by the Company’s Board of Directors at any time in
the Company’s sole discretion.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company did not repurchase any shares
in conjunction with the stock repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 5,917,940 shares for an aggregate of $225.1 million (of which $75.1 million, including commissions and
fees, was purchased under a previous repurchase plan) including commissions and fees. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 3,174,385 shares for an aggregate of $107.4 million including
commissions and fees. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had a remaining authorization to repurchase an additional $150.0 million of its common stock under its current $300.0 million stock repurchase program.

Registration of Additional Shares

On May 20, 2010, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering 15.0 million shares of the Company’s Class A common
stock issuable under the 2010 Performance and Equity Incentive Plan. See Note 17.

The Company filed shelf registration
statements on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering 4.0 million shares of its Class A common stock in 2007. These shares may be issued in connection with acquisitions of wireless communication towers or antenna
sites and related assets or companies that own wireless communication towers, antenna sites or related assets. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not issue any shares of its Class A common stock
pursuant to this registration statement in connection with acquisitions. At December 31, 2012, approximately 1.7 million shares remain available for issuance under this shelf registration statement.

On February 27, 2012, the Company filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned
issuers on Form S-3ASR. This registration statement enables the Company to issue shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, preferred stock or debt securities either separately or represented by warrants, or depositary shares as well as
units that include any of these securities. Under the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements, the Company will file a prospectus supplement and advise the Commission of the amount and type of securities each time the Company issues
securities under this registration statement. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company did not issue any securities under this automatic shelf registration statement.

On March 7, 2012, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (together, the “Underwriters”) pursuant to which the Company sold to the Underwriters 6,005,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at $47.30 per share (proceeds of $283.9
million, net of related fees). The shares were issued and sold pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and prospectus supplement related thereto. On April 13, 2012, the proceeds of this offering were used to
partially redeem principal balances of the Senior Notes.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company has two equity participation plans (the 2001 Equity Participation Plan and the 2010 Performance and Equity
Incentive Plan, the “2010 Plan”) whereby options (both non-qualified and incentive stock options), restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other equity and performance based instruments may be granted to directors, employees
and consultants. The options and restricted stock units generally vest from the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the vesting term and generally have a seven-year or a ten-year contractual life.

Upon the adoption of the 2010 Plan by the Company’s shareholders on May 6, 2010, no further grants were permitted under the
2001 Equity Participation Plan. The 2010 Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of 15.0 million shares of our Class A common stock, however, the aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards,
restricted stock unit awards, stock bonus awards, performance awards, other stock-based awards or other awards granted under the 2010 Plan will not exceed 7.5 million. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had 13.5 million shares remaining
available for future issuance under the 2010 Plan.

Restricted shares of Class A common stock or options to purchase
Class A common stock have been granted in the past under the Company’s equity participation plans at prices below market value at the time of grant. The Company did not have any non-cash compensation expense during the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, relating to the issuance of restricted shares or options to purchase Class A common stock at below market value at the time of grant.

Stock Options

The Company records compensation expense for employee
stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses a combination of historical data and historical
volatility to establish the expected volatility. Historical data is used to estimate the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the
estimated life of the option. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2008 Purchase Plan”) which
reserved 500,000 shares of Class A common stock for purchase. The 2008 Purchase Plan permits eligible employee participants to purchase Class A common stock at a price per share which is equal to 85% of the fair market value of
Class A common stock on the last day of an offering period.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, 23,724 shares of
Class A common stock were issued under the 2008 Purchase Plan, which resulted in cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 when approximately 30,942 shares of Class A
common stock were issued under the 2008 Purchase Plan, which resulted in cash proceeds to the Company of $1.0 million. At December 31, 2012, 380,045 shares remained available for issuance under the 2008 Purchase Plan. In addition, the Company
recorded $0.2 million of non-cash compensation expense relating to the shares issued under the 2008 Purchase Plans for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010.

Of these amounts, $148 and ($20,932) are included in the Other assets and Other long-term liabilities respectively on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2011, $(5,963) is included within other long-term liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Valuation allowances of $233.7 million and $175.8 million were being carried to offset net deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The net increase in the valuation
allowance for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $57.9 million and $38.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2012 the valuation allowance related to federal and state tax credit carryovers was approximately $4.4 million and
$0.4 million, respectively. These tax credits expire beginning 2017.

The Company has available at December 31, 2012, a
net federal operating tax loss carry-forward of approximately $1.2 billion and an additional $152.9 million of net operating tax loss carry forward from stock options which will benefit additional paid-in capital when the loss is utilized. These net
operating tax loss carry-forwards will expire between 2019 and 2032. The Internal Revenue Code places limitations upon the future availability of net operating losses based upon changes in the equity of the Company. If these occur, the ability of
the Company to offset future income with existing net operating losses may be limited. In addition, the Company has available at December 31, 2012, a foreign net operating loss carry-forward of $15.4 million and a net state operating tax loss
carry-forward of approximately $579.3 million. These net operating tax loss carry-forwards will expire between 2013 and 2032.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In accordance with the Company’s methodology for determining when stock option
deductions are deemed realized, the Company utilizes a “with-and-without” approach that will result in a benefit not being recorded in APIC if the amount of available net operating loss carry-forwards generated from operations is
sufficient to offset the current year taxable income.

The Company does not expect to remit earnings from its foreign
subsidiaries. Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $4.6 million at December 31, 2012. Those earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. Federal and state
income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company could be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes
payable to various foreign countries.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

The Company is obligated under various non-cancelable operating leases for land, office space, equipment and site leases that expire at various times through December 2112. In addition, the Company is
obligated under various non-cancelable capital leases for vehicles that expire at various times through December 2017.

The
annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases in effect as of December 31, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):

Future minimum rental payments under noncancelable ground leases include payments for certain renewal
periods at the Company’s option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenue from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the Company will renew the lease. The majority of
operating leases provide for renewal at varying escalations. Fixed rate escalations have been included in the table disclosed above.

Rent expense for operating leases was $133.1 million, $82.8 million and $75.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, certain of the Company’s
leases include contingent rent provisions which provide for the lessor to receive additional rent upon the attainment of certain tower operating results and/or lease-up. Contingent rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and
2010 was $16.1 million, $13.7 million and $12.5 million, respectively.

1.7% and will mature in periods ranging from approximately one to five years.

Tenant Leases

The annual minimum tower lease income to be received for tower space and antenna rental under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as
of December 31, 2012 is as follows:

The Company’s tenant leases provide for annual escalations and multiple renewal periods, at the
tenant’s option. The tenant rental payments disclosed in the table above do not assume exercise of tenant renewal options, however, fixed rate escalations have been included.

Litigation

The Company is involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such matters and it is
impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs that may be incurred, management believes the resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

Contingent Purchase Obligations

As discussed in Note 6, from time to time, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration (or earnouts) for acquisitions if the towers
or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets in the one to three years after they have been acquired. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, certain earnings targets associated with the acquired towers
were achieved, and therefore, the Company paid in cash $5.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the Company’s estimate of its potential obligation if the performance targets contained in various acquisition
agreements were met was $9.8 million which the Company recorded in accrued expenses. The maximum potential obligation related to the performance targets was $17.1 million and $11.2 million as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011,
respectively.

SEGMENT DATA

The Company operates principally in two business segments: site leasing and site development. The Company’s
reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different services. They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations. The site leasing segment includes results of the managed and sublease businesses.
The site development segment includes the results of both consulting and construction related activities. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company combined its site development segments, as the nature of the services were complimentary to one
another. All prior periods presented have been restated to conform to the current year presentation.

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (unaudited)

Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares for the period. Potentially dilutive instruments have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.

Because loss per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share amounts for the four quarters
may not equal the total loss per share amounts for the year.
