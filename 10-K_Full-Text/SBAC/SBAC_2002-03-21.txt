PART I

ITEM
I.    BUSINESS

General

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the United States and Puerto Rico. We generate revenues from our two primary businesses, site leasing and site development. In our
site leasing business, we lease antenna space on towers and other structures that we own or manage for others. The towers that we own have either been built by us at the request of a wireless carrier or built or acquired based on our own initiative.
As of December 31, 2001, we owned or controlled 3,734 towers. We expect to build or acquire approximately 250 to 350 towers during 2002. In our site development business, we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing their own
networks, including designing a network with signal coverage, identifying and acquiring locations to place their antennas and transmission equipment, obtaining zoning approvals, building towers when necessary and installing their antennas and
transmission equipment. Since our founding in 1989, we have participated in the development of more than 15,000 antenna sites in 49 of the 51 major wireless markets in the United States.

Company Services

We provide our services on a local basis, through regional
offices, territory offices and project offices, which are opened and closed on a project by project basis. Operationally, we are divided into regions throughout the United States, run by regional vice presidents. Each region is divided into
sub-regions run by general managers and we have further divided each sub-region into geographic territories run by territory managers. Within each territory manager’s geographic area of responsibility he or she is responsible for all
operations, including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices, and a substantial portion of the sales in such area.

Our executive, corporate development, accounting, finance, human resources, legal and regulatory, information technology departments, site administration personnel, and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in Boca
Raton, Florida. We also have in our Boca Raton office certain sales, new tower build support, and tower maintenance personnel.

Site Leasing Services

In 1997 we began aggressively expanding our site leasing business by capitalizing on our nationally recognized site
development experience and strong relationships with wireless service providers to take advantage of the trends toward co-location, which is the placement of multiple antennas on one tower or other structure, and independent tower ownership. We
believe our towers have significant capacity to accommodate additional tenants with minimal incremental costs. Additionally, due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we believe future expenditures required to maintain these
towers will be minimal.

The following chart shows the number of towers we built for our own account, the number of towers we
acquired and the number of tenants at year end on our towers, for the periods indicated:

(1)

Periods for 1997 to 2000 have been adjusted from amounts previously reported to reflect as one tenant, multiple leases with the same user on a tower regardless of the amount of
equipment, additional equipment, microwave, etc.

We expect the rate of tower additions to the portfolio to decline in 2002 compared to prior periods.


The following table indicates the number of our acquired and built towers based on location as
of December 31, 2001:


We believe our history and experience in providing site development services gives us a
competitive advantage in choosing the most attractive locations on which to build new towers or buy existing towers, as measured by our success in increasing tower revenues and cash flows. Our same tower revenue growth and same tower cash flow
growth at December 31, 2001, on the 2,390 towers we owned as of December 31, 2000, was 24%, and 29% respectively, based on tenant leases signed and revenues annualized as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Our site leasing revenue comes from a variety of wireless carriers, including AT&T Wireless, Cingular, Nextel, Sprint PCS, Verizon and VoiceStream.
Site leasing revenue was $103.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. We believe that our site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers continue to lease
antenna space on our towers.

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of
wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts. We lease antenna space on:

•

the towers we have constructed through carrier directives under build-to-suit programs;

•

existing towers we have acquired;

•

the towers we have built on locations we have selected which we call “strategic” new tower builds; and

•

towers we lease, sublease and/or manage for third parties.

A significant number of our towers were built under our build-to-suit program, through which we built towers for a wireless service provider on a location of their direction. We retained ownership of the tower and the
exclusive right to co-locate additional tenants on the tower. Many wireless service providers chose the build-to-suit option as an alternative to owning the towers themselves. Our build-to-suit sites came from a variety of wireless carriers,
including Alamosa PCS, AT&T Wireless, Cingular, Horizon PCS, Sprint PCS, TeleCorp PCS, Triton PCS and VoiceStream.

To help
maximize the revenue and profit we earn from our capital investment in the towers we own, we have begun to provide services at our tower locations beyond the leasing of antenna space. These services which we provide, or may provide in the future,
include generator provisioning, antenna installation, equipment installation and backhaul, which is the transport of the wireless signals transmitted or received by an antenna to a carrier’s network. Some of these services are recurring in
nature, and are contracted for by a wireless carrier or other user in a manner similar to the way they lease antenna space.

Site Development Services

Our site development business consists of two segments, site development consulting and site development construction,
through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of end-to-end services. In the consulting segment of our site development business, we offer clients the following services: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification
of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; and (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits. In the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of
services, including the following: (1) tower and related site construction; (2) switch building construction; (3) antenna installation; and (4) radio equipment installation, commissioning and service. We will continue to use our site development
expertise to complement our site leasing business. We have capitalized on our leadership position in the site development business and our strong relationships with wireless service providers to build and acquire towers in locations that we believe
are attractive to wireless service providers.

Our site development customers currently comprise many of the major wireless
communications companies, including AT&T Wireless, Cingular, Nextel, Sprint PCS, Verizon and VoiceStream. Site development revenue was $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $115.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.


Business Strategy

Our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers and expand our position as a leading provider of site development services.
Key elements of our strategy include:

Maximizing Use of Tower Capacity.

We believe that many of
our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennae and that increased use of our owned towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost. We generally have constructed our towers to accommodate multiple tenants in addition to the
anchor tenant, and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers. We actively market space on our own towers through our internal sales force.

Capturing Other Revenues That Flow From our Tower Ownership.

Tenants who lease antenna space on our towers need a variety of additional services in
connection with their operations at the tower site. These services include installation, maintenance and upgrading of radio transmission equipment, antennas, cabling and other connection equipment, electricity, backhaul (which is provided generally
by telephone lines or a microwave antenna network), equipment shelters, data collection and network monitoring. Tenants often outsource the performance of some or all of these required services to third parties, including us. Because of our
ownership of the tower, our control of the tower site and our experience and capabilities in providing these types of services, we believe that we are well positioned, and intend, to perform more of these services and capture the related revenue.

Maintaining our Expertise in Site Development Services.

We continue to perform an array of site
development services for wireless service and other telecommunications providers across the United States. We have a broad national field organization that allows us to identify and participate in site development projects across the country and
that gives us a knowledge of local markets and strong customer relationships with wireless service and other telecommunications providers. We believe our site development experience provides us with a competitive advantage in selecting the best
locations for tower ownership.

Executing on a Local Basis.

We believe that substantially all of
what we do is best done locally, given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities. We believe our customers make decisions locally. We believe that to be successful in tower building, acquisition and leasing, and site
acquisition, zoning and construction, we must have a strong local presence in the markets we serve.

Capitalizing on our
Management Experience.

Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development services. Management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless carriers will allow
us to expand our position as a leading provider of site development services.

Building on Strong Relationships with Major
Wireless Service Providers.

We are well-positioned to be a preferred partner in site development projects and tower space leasing because of our strong relationships with wireless service and other telecommunications
providers and our proven operating experience.

Customers

Since commencing operations, we have performed site leasing and site development services for many of the largest wireless service providers. The majority of our contracts have been for
PCS broadband, ESMR and cellular customers. We also serve wireless data and Internet, paging, PCS narrowband, SMR, multi-channel multi-point distribution service, or MMDS, and multi-point distribution service, or MDS, wireless providers. In both our
site development and site leasing businesses, we work with large national providers and smaller local, regional or private operators. For the year ended December 31, 2001, Nextel provided 11.6%, Sprint PCS provided 11.5% and Bechtel Corporation
(contractor for AT&T Wireless) provided 10.9% of our site development revenues. In 2000, Sprint PCS provided 10.8% and Alamosa provided 11.0% of our site development revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2001, Nextel provided 10.4% of our
site leasing revenues. In 2000, Nextel provided 10.6% and Sprint PCS provided 10.3% of our site leasing revenues. No other customer represented more than 10% of our site leasing or site development revenues.


During the past two years, we provided services for a number of customers, including:

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing goals are:

•

to use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and purchase related services with respect to our owned or
managed towers, enabling us to grow our site leasing business;

•

to form affiliations with select communications systems vendors who use end-to-end services, including those provided by us, which will enable us to market our services and
product offerings through additional channels of distribution;

•

to further cultivate existing customers to sell site development services; and

•

to continue to grow and sustain a market leadership position in the site development business.

We approach sales on a company-wide basis, involving many of our employees. We have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team. Our
dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office. We also rely on our regional vice presidents, general managers, territory managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers. Our
strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with the wireless service providers. Most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices. We believe
that providers at the regional and local levels make most decisions for site development and site leasing services with input from their corporate headquarters. Our sales representatives work with provider representatives at the regional and local
levels and at the national level when appropriate. Our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentive-based goals and measurements. A substantial number of our operations personnel have sales-based incentive components in their
compensation plans.

In addition to our marketing and sales staff, we rely upon our executive and operations personnel on the
regional and territory office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts.

Our primary marketing
and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in Boca Raton, Florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices. We have a full-time staff dedicated to our marketing efforts. The marketing and sales
support staff are charged with implementing our marketing strategies, prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals.


Competition

We compete with:

•

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower footprints and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers;

•

site development companies that acquire antenna space on existing towers for wireless service providers, manage new tower construction and provide site development services;

•

other large independent tower companies; and

•

smaller local independent tower operators.

Wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do. We believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a
geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business.

Our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are the four large public tower companies, American Tower Corporation, Crown Castle International Corp., Pinnacle Holdings, Inc.
and SpectraSite Holdings, Inc. In addition, we compete with AT&T Wireless Services and with Sprint PCS who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers.

We believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively, while some firms appear
to offer their services nationally, including American Tower Corporation, Bechtel, Black & Veach, General Dynamics, Mastec, Mericom, and SpectraSite Holdings, Inc. The market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering
individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site development consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency
engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors, which provide end-to-end site development services through multiple subcontractors, and providers’ internal staff. We believe that providers base their decisions for site
development services on a number of criteria, including a company’s experience, track record, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. We believe that we compete favorably in these areas.

Employees

As of December 31, 2001, we had
approximately 1,350 employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good. In February 2002, we announced that, in connection with our plan to significantly reduce our tower
acquisition and new build programs, we would be closing certain offices and reducing personnel. As of March 1, 2002 we had approximately 1,100 employees as a result of this reduction and the number is expected to be further reduced through the
remainder of 2002.

Regulatory and Environmental Matters

Federal Regulations.

Both the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) regulate towers used for wireless
communications. These regulations govern the construction and marking and painting of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require prior approval and registration of towers. Wireless communications devices operating
on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency or frequency band used.


Pursuant to the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the FCC, in
conjunction with the FAA, has developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified towers. These standards mandate that the FCC and the FAA consider the height of proposed tower structures, the relationship of the structure to existing
natural or man-made obstructions and the proximity of the towers to runways and airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air
navigation. The FAA may condition its issuance of a no-hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting, marking and/or painting requirements. Towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the FCC. A
tower that requires FAA clearance will not be registered by the FCC until it is cleared by the FAA. Upon registration the FCC may also require special lighting, marking and/or painting requirements. Owners of wireless transmission towers may have an
obligation to maintain marking, painting and lighting to conform to FAA and FCC standards. Tower owners also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the FAA of any tower lighting outage or malfunction. In addition,
any applicant for an FCC antenna structure registration must certify that, consistent with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of Federal benefits because of a conviction for the
possession or distribution of a controlled substance. We generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities
jurisdiction over the construction, modification and placement of towers. The new law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would (1) discriminate between different providers of personal wireless services or (2) ban
altogether the construction, modification or placement of radio communication towers. Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites
for their facilities. This may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities.

Owners and operators of towers may be subject to, and therefore must comply with, environmental laws. Any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of their decisions under certain circumstances. The FCC has issued regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy
Act. These regulations place responsibility on each applicant to investigate any potential environmental effects of operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing
a tower. In the event the FCC determines the proposed tower would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the FCC has developed, the FCC would be required to prepare an environmental assessment, which will be subject to public
comment. This process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower.

As an owner and operator of real
property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination and related personal or property damage. We are also subject to certain environmental laws
that govern tower placement, including pre-construction environmental studies. Operators of towers must also take into consideration certain RF emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements. The potential
connection between RF emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we
have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws. These costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or
results of operations.

State and Local Regulations.

Most states regulate certain aspects of real
estate acquisition and leasing activities and construction activities. Where required, we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers agents, who may be our employees or hired
as independent contractors, and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors, who may be our employees or independent contractors. Local regulations include city and other local


ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local
officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction. Local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new transmission towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers,
and have, in some instances, instituted moratoria.

Recent Developments

In August 2001, we announced that we were adjusting our new tower build construction plan and operation to produce 100 to 150 new towers per quarter commencing with the third quarter of
2001, instead of the 200 to 250 new towers per quarter previously built or capable of being built by us. At that time we expected to build a total of approximately 600 to 700 new towers in 2001 and approximately 400 to 600 in 2002. In connection
with this adjustment, we recorded a $24.4 million charge in the third quarter of 2001. Included in this charge was a write-off of costs previously reflected on our balance sheet as construction-in-process for certain new tower build sites for which
development activity had been abandoned, costs of employee separation for certain employees and costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were previously utilized primarily in our new tower development activities.

In February 2002, we announced that as a result of capital market conditions we were further reducing our planned capital
expenditures for new tower development activities in 2002 and subsequently suspending any material new investment for additional towers. We have reduced the number of towers expected to be built or acquired in 2002 to approximately 250 to 350
towers. We expect approximately 90 to 110 new towers to be built or acquired in the first quarter of 2002, and the remainder of our obligations to build or acquire towers to be satisfied later in 2002. Under current capital markets conditions, we do
not anticipate building or buying a material number of new towers beyond those we are currently contractually obligated to build or buy. In connection with this restructuring plan we anticipate incurring charges of between $30.0 million and $65.0
million related to the disposal of new tower build and acquisition construction-in-process, costs of employee separation, costs associated with the closing of offices and other items. The amount of the charge related to asset disposals will be
determined primarily by the fair value of costs of construction-in-process with respect to those new builds we choose to dispose of. Most of this charge is expected to be incurred in the first quarter of 2002 with the remainder incurred in the
second quarter of 2002.

In the first quarter of 2002 we are required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, (“SFAS 142”). With the adoption of SFAS 142 we will assess the impairment, if any, on goodwill and certain other intangible assets, in lieu of amortization against earnings. We are
currently performing that assessment and have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 142 will have on our consolidated financial statements, however, we believe the impact may be material. As of December 31, 2001 we had unamortized
goodwill and covenants not to compete of $86.2 million.

Backlog

Our backlog for site development services was $58.8 million as of December 31, 2001 as compared to $61.0 million as of December 31, 2000. Our backlog for pending tower acquisitions was
145 towers as of December 31, 2001 as compared to 677 towers as of December 31, 2000. We were pursuing build-to-suit mandates for approximately 400 towers as of December 31, 2001 as compared to 600 as of December 31, 2000. As a result of actions we
have taken in connection with our announced reduction of capital expenditures for new tower assets, our backlog of tower acquisitions and towers under build-to-suit mandates has been materially reduced. During the first quarter of 2002 we expect to
acquire 40 to 50 towers. We do not anticipate having any material amount of pending tower acquisitions in our backlog as of March 31, 2002. We expect to build 60 to 70 towers during the first quarter of 2002 and to have build-to-suit mandates for
approximately 160 towers in our backlog as of March 31, 2002. We anticipate that we will perform all of these services and complete the pending tower acquisitions during the current fiscal year.


RISK FACTORS

We may not be able to service our substantial indebtedness.

As indicated below, we have
and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity size.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For
example, it could:

•

limit our ability to repay our borrowings under our senior credit facility, our 10¼% senior notes and our 12% senior discount notes;

•

limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and development costs;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•

subject us to interest rate risk;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are less leveraged;

•

require us to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations; and

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds.

Our ability to service our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. Based on our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2001, we would require approximately $56.8 million of cash flow from
operations (before net cash interest expenses) to discharge our cash interest obligations for the twelve months ending December 31, 2002. By comparison, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, we generated $53.7 million of cash flow from
operations (before net cash interest expenses). As we borrow under our senior credit facility, the amount of cash flow needed to fund our cash interest obligations will increase. This amount will increase materially in September 2003 once we begin
to pay cash interest on our 12% senior discount notes and begin to amortize our $100.0 million term loan under our senior credit facility, $5.0 million of which is required to be repaid in 2003. If we do not materially increase our cash flow by
then, we will not be able to meet our obligations. In order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness, we may from time to time sell assets, issue equity, or repurchase, restructure or refinance some or all of our debt. We may not be able to
effect any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms, if at all. The implementation of any of these alternative strategies may dilute our current shareholders, subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our
business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy.

We pay interest on amounts
outstanding under our senior credit facility at variable interest rates. In addition, we have entered and may in the future enter into interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. Therefore, if
interest rates were to increase, the amount of interest that we would have to pay would increase.

Our cash flow is negative
and we need to access external sources of liquidity to fund tower development activities.

During 2001, we did not generate
sufficient cash flow from our operations to fund our cash expenditures and we expect this situation to continue until early 2003. Therefore our ability to continue operating at our current level of activity is contingent upon receiving external
sources of funding. Based on current capital market


conditions, we may not be able to access either the debt or equity markets on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Consequently, we believe that the only likely material source of liquidity
to fund our cash flow gap in 2002 and through early 2003 will be availability under our senior credit facility. At December 31, 2001, we had approximately $190.0 million of funds available to us under our senior credit facility. In September 2003,
we begin paying cash interest on our 12% senior discount notes and begin making principal payments on our term loan under our senior credit facility. To make such payments we may rely in part on availability under our senior credit facility, even
assuming that we have materially increased our cash flow from operations by that time. If we are unable to borrow sufficient funds under our senior credit facility, and we are unable to access other sources of funding, we may not be able to satisfy
our obligations and may be required to reduce our levels of business activity, sell assets, and/or restructure or refinance our debt. Availability under our senior credit facility is subject to various risks including our compliance with the
covenants specified in the senior credit facility agreement and compliance by the lenders with their financial commitment.

Our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business.

Our senior credit
facility and the indentures governing our 10¼% senior notes and our 12% senior discount notes each contain certain restrictive covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell assets for
less than fair market value, pay dividends, redeem outstanding debt or engage in other restricted payments. If we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments.

SBA Telecommunications, Inc., our principal subsidiary which owns all of the common stock of our other subsidiaries, is the borrower under
our senior credit facility. The senior credit facility requires SBA Telecommunications to maintain specified financial ratios, including ratios regarding SBA Telecommunications’ consolidated debt coverage, debt service, interest expense and
fixed charges for each quarter and satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining a minimum consolidated EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring expenses).
Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet these tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility.
If an event of default occurs, our lenders can prevent us from borrowing additional amounts. In addition, upon the occurrence of any event of default, other than certain bankruptcy events, our senior credit facility lenders can elect to declare all
amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility, together with all accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events, the outstanding principal, together with all accrued
interest, will automatically become immediately due and payable. The occurrence of any event of default under our senior credit facility may cause a cross-default in our 10¼% senior notes, our 12% senior discount notes and/or any of our other
indebtedness and may permit the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness. If the indebtedness under the senior credit facility and/or indebtedness under our 10¼% senior notes or 12% senior discount notes were to be accelerated, our
assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness. If we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior credit facility, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.
Substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under the senior credit facility.

We may not secure as many site
leasing tenants as planned.

If tenant demand for tower space decreases, we may not be able to successfully grow our site
leasing business. This may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our obligations. Our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and
assumptions concerning future tenant demand for independently-owned towers. Tenant demand includes both the number of tenants and the lease rates they are willing to pay.

Wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and several of the independent tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources
than we do. We believe that


tower location and capacity, price, quality of service and density within a geographic market historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the
site leasing business.

Demand for antennae space on communication sites may be adversely affected by consolidation of our
wireless service provider customers. Economic conditions have resulted in the consolidation of several wireless service providers and this trend is likely to continue. To the extent that our customers consolidate, they may terminate any duplicative
leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as many spaces on our towers in the future. This would adversely affect our growth, our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flow.

Wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications
facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services. Wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communications sites owned or
controlled by us. The proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.

We may
be adversely affected by an economic slowdown.

The significant general slowdown in the U.S. economy has negatively affected
(1) the financial condition of wireless service providers, (2) the availability of capital, and the willingness of wireless service providers to utilize capital, to expand their networks and (3) may negatively affect the growth rate of consumer
demand for wireless services. As a result of the economic slowdown, and the negative impact of such slowdown on the debt and equity markets, we have adjusted our business to significantly reduce the number of new towers added to our portfolio. In
August 2001, we announced that we were adjusting our new tower build construction plan and operation to produce 100 to 150 new towers per quarter commencing with the third quarter of 2001, instead of the 200 to 250 new towers per quarter previously
built or capable of being built by us. In February 2002, we announced that we were further reducing our capital expenditures for new tower development activities in 2002 and subsequently suspending any material new investment for additional towers.
If the U.S. economy continues to suffer from the economic slowdown or if the economy worsens, these factors could result in a material decrease in the demand for our tower space and our site development services.

We are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses.

We are not profitable. The following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated:

Our losses are principally due to significant interest expense, depreciation,
amortization and in the year 2001, a restructuring and other charge of $24.4 million. We expect to continue to have significant interest expense and depreciation charges in 2002. In addition, during 2002 we will incur a restructuring charge of $30.0
million to $65.0 million. We have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.

If demand for wireless communication services decreases, our revenue will be adversely affected.

Substantially
all of our customers to date have been providers of wireless communications services. If demand for wireless communication services decreases, our revenue growth will be, and our revenue may be, adversely affected. This could affect our ability to
satisfy our obligations. Demand for both our site leasing and site development services is dependent on demand for communication sites from wireless service providers, which, in turn, is dependent on the demand for wireless services. A slowdown in
the growth of, or reduction in


demand in, a particular wireless communication segment could adversely affect the demand for communication sites. Most types of wireless services currently require ground-based network
facilities, including communication sites for transmission and reception. The extent to which wireless service providers lease these communication sites depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:

•

the level of demand for wireless services;

•

the financial condition and access to capital of wireless service providers;

•

the strategy of wireless service providers with respect to owning or leasing communication sites;

•

government licensing of broadcast rights; and

•

changes in telecommunications regulations and general economic conditions.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers that vary at any given time, particularly in the site development services side of our business. The loss of any significant customer
could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.

Following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of total
revenues derived from such customers:

Revenues from these clients are derived
from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. Each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of 5 years with five 5-year renewable options.
Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. In addition, a customer’s need for site development services can decrease, and we may not
be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. Moreover, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects.

Due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, the tower industry is very sensitive to the creditworthiness of its tenants. Wireless service providers often operate with substantial leverage, and
financial problems for our customers could result in uncollected accounts receivable, in the loss of customers and the associated lease revenues, or in a reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities. During the past two years,
a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our paging customers. Although these bankruptcies have not yet had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues, pending bankruptcies and any future
bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business or revenues.

New technologies may have a material adverse
effect on our growth rate and results of operations.

The emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on
our towers. This could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations. For example, the FCC has granted license applications for several low-earth orbiting satellite systems that are intended to provide mobile voice and
data services. Although these systems are highly capital intensive and have only begun to be tested, mobile satellite


systems could compete with land-based wireless communications systems. In addition, products are currently being developed which may permit multiple wireless carriers to use a single antenna, to
share networks, or to increase the range and capacity of an antenna, which, if successful, could reduce the number of antenna needed by our customers.

We may not be able to materially increase our tower assets without additional financing.

Our ability to materially increase the size of our tower portfolio through cash expenditures depends on the availability of additional financing as we do not expect to generate material amounts of excess cash flow from our operations
for at least the next two years. Based on current capital market conditions, we have announced our intent to significantly scale back our tower acquisitions, build-to-suit program and strategic siting programs. We do not expect to recommence these
programs until such time, if ever, that capital is available to us on terms we find acceptable. If we are not able to increase the size of our tower portfolio it may materially adversely affect our long-term growth rates.

Our quarterly operating results fluctuate and therefore should not be considered indicative of our long-term results.

The number of towers we build or acquire, the number of tenants we add to our towers and the demand for our site development services fluctuate from
quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of long-term results. Numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including:

•

the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures;

•

the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’ fiscal year;

•

the number and significance of active customer engagements during a quarter;

•

delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment;

•

seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter;

•

employee hiring;

•

the use of vendors by our customers; and

•

the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development.

Although the demand for our services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts. The timing of
revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments, budgetary cycles and pressures and general economic conditions. In addition, under lease terms
typical in the tower industry, revenue generated by new tenant leases usually commences upon installation of the tenant’s equipment on the tower rather than upon execution of the lease, which can be 90 days or more after the execution of the
lease.

Our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our
business.

We are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business. Both the FCC and the FAA regulate towers
used for wireless communications and radio and television antennae. In addition, the FCC separately licenses and regulates wireless communication devices and television and radio stations operating from towers. Such regulations control construction,
lighting, painting and marking of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower, require registration of tower facilities. Certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the FAA to ensure that
the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation. Tower owners


may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or install lighting to conform to FAA standards and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. Tower owners may also bear the responsibility
of notifying the FAA of any tower lighting failures. Failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers
against any such failure to comply. In addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth.

Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require tower
owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction. Local regulations can delay or prevent new tower construction or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to
customer demand. In addition, such regulations increase costs associated with new tower construction or upgrade projects at our existing tower sites. We cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect the timing or cost
of new tower construction or upgrades or that additional regulations will not be adopted that increase such delays or result in additional costs to us. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth.

Our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters.

Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. We maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged
towers, but these insurance policies are subject to caps and deductibles. We also maintain third party liability insurance to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. A tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or
damage to a tower or group of towers could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.

Steven E. Bernstein controls the outcome of shareholder votes and therefore disinterested shareholders will not control many corporate governance matters.

Steven E. Bernstein, our Chairman of the Board, controls 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Our Class B common stock has the right
to 10 votes for each share provided that the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent more than 10% of the aggregate amount of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. As of March 15, 2002, the Class B common stock represented 11.2%
of the aggregate amount of common stock outstanding. As of March 15, 2002, Mr. Bernstein controlled approximately 57% of the total voting power of both classes of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Bernstein has the ability to control the outcome of
all matters determined by a majority vote of our common shareholders when voting together as a single class. Consequently, disinterested shareholders will not be able to determine who is elected as a director nor the outcome of other corporate
governance matters subject to approval by the majority of the outstanding shares.

The loss of the services of certain of our
executive officers may negatively affect our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and
active participation of our key senior executives. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key senior executives. Although we have an employment agreement with Jeffrey A. Stoops, our President and Chief
Executive Officer, we do not have employment agreements with many of our other key senior executives. If we were to lose any of the key senior executives we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our results of
operations could be negatively affected.

If we are unable to attract, retain or manage skilled employees it could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

Our business, particularly site development services, involves the delivery of
professional services and is labor-intensive. The loss of a significant number of employees, our inability to hire a sufficient number of


qualified employees or adequately develop and motivate the skilled employees we have hired could have a material adverse effect on our business. We compete with other wireless communications
firms and other enterprises for employees with the skills required to perform our services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly-skilled employees in the future or that we will continue to be
successful in training, retaining and motivating employees.

Our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively
affect our business.

We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our dependence on our subsidiaries
for cash flow may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our only significant asset is, and is expected to be, the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries. We conduct, and expect to conduct, all of our business operations through
our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations is distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow. We currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and
used by them in their operations, including servicing their debt obligations, except as necessary to be distributed to us to cover holding company expenses including interest payments on our 10¼% senior notes and 12% senior discount notes. Even
if our subsidiaries determined to make a distribution to us, applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including dividend covenants contained in our senior credit facility, may restrict or prohibit these dividends or distributions.

We may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect the value of your investment.

The stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for the common stock of
companies. In the past, certain broad market fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a material decline in the market price of
our Class A common stock.

We have adopted anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire us.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law could make it more difficult for a
third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. We recently adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a
transaction that our board of directors opposes. These provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of
a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our Class A common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if such emissions are
demonstrated to cause negative health effects.

The government imposes requirements and other guidelines on our towers
relating to radio emissions. The potential connection between radio emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. To date, the
results of these studies have been inconclusive. However, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth.
In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services.

If a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. If we were subject to numerous
claims relating to radio emissions, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our operations, costs and revenues would be materially and adversely affected.


Future issuances of our stock may cause dilution.

In connection with our financing and tower acquisition programs, we have agreed and in the future may agree to issue material amounts of our Class A
common stock which could cause dilution to our current shareholders. As of December 31, 2001, we had the obligation to issue shares of Class A common stock for an amount up to $5.0 million if the towers that we have acquired meet or exceed certain
earnings or new tower targets identified in the various acquisition agreements. In addition, we may have up to an aggregate of $21.4 million in additional earn-out obligations that may be paid in cash or shares of Class A common stock, at our
option, if the businesses acquired meet or exceed the agreed earnings or new tower targets.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

We are headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, where we currently lease approximately 73,000 square feet of space. We have
entered into long-term leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longer-term. We open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business, and
offices for new tower build projects are generally leased for periods not to exceed 18 months. Our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee interests, leasehold interests created by long-term lease agreements, private easements,
easements and licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. Please refer to “Site Leasing Services” for a listing of the locations of towers.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we are involved in
various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not a party to any legal proceeding, the adverse outcome of which, individually or taken together with all other legal proceedings, is expected to have a
material adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A
VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matter was submitted to the vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.


PART II

ITEM 5.    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

The Class A common stock commenced trading under the symbol “SBAC” on The Nasdaq National Market System (“Nasdaq”) on June 16, 1999. The following table presents
trading information for the Class A common stock for the periods indicated on the Nasdaq:

As of March 15, 2002, there were 223 record holders of our Class A common stock,
and 3 record holders of our Class B common stock. There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.

We have not paid a dividend on any class of common stock and anticipate that we will retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Consequently, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on any of our
common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, we are restricted under our senior credit facility, the 10¼% senior notes and the 12% senior discount notes from paying dividends or making distributions and repurchasing, redeeming or
otherwise acquiring any shares of common stock except under certain circumstances.

ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table sets forth selected historical financial and other data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997. The historical financial data has
been derived from, and is qualified by reference to, our audited financial statements. The information set forth below should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.


(a)

For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative expense includes non-cash compensation expense of $3.3 million in connection with stock option grants,
restricted stock grants and the issuance of Class A common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2000, selling, general and administrative expense included non-cash compensation expense of $0.3 million in connection with stock option and restricted
stock activity. For the year ended December 31, 1999, selling, general and administrative expenses included non-cash compensation expense of $0.3 million incurred in connection with the issuance of stock options and Class A common stock. For the
year ended December 31, 1998, selling, general and administrative expense included non-cash compensation expense of $0.6 million incurred in connection with stock option activity.

(b)

Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1997 included the tax effect of our conversion to a C corporation.

(c)

EBITDA represents earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges (including those referred to in footnote (a) above) and unusual or
non-recurring expenses. EBITDA is commonly used in the telecommunications industry to analyze companies on the basis of operating performance, leverage and liquidity. EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor has
it been presented as an alternative to operating income or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Companies calculate EBITDA differently and, therefore, EBITDA as presented by us may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. See our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in our Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this filing.

(d)

We define “tower cash flow” as site leasing revenue less cost of site leasing revenue (exclusive of depreciation). We believe tower cash flow is useful because it
allows you to compare tower performance before the effect of expenses (selling, general and administrative) that do not relate directly to tower performance. We define ‘‘annualized tower cash flow’’ as tower cash flow for the
last calendar quarter attributable to our site leasing business multiplied by four.

(e)

Includes the value of Class A common stock issued in connection with acquisitions.

(f)

Periods for 1997 to 2000 have been adjusted from amounts previously reported to reflect as one tenant, multiple leases with the same user on a tower regardless of the amount of
equipment, additional equipment, microwave, etc.

ITEM
7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We are
a leading independent owner and operator of over 3,700 wireless communications towers in the United States and Puerto Rico. We generate revenues from our two primary businesses, site leasing and site development. In our site leasing business we
lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own or manage for others. The towers that we own have either been constructed by us at the request of a carrier, built or constructed based on our own
initiative or acquired. In our site development business, we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own networks.

We are continuing to shift our revenue stream from project driven revenues more to recurring revenues through the leasing of antenna space at or on communications facilities. We intend to emphasize our site leasing
business through the leasing and management of tower sites and we believe we have well positioned ourselves to perform many of the other types of services that wireless service providers need in connection with the operation and maintenance of a
wireless telecommunications network. Those services include installation, maintenance and


upgrading of radio transmission equipment, antennas, cabling and other connection equipment, electricity, backhaul, equipment shelters, data collection and network monitoring.

Site Leasing Services

Site leasing
revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies. Revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts. Each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and
is generally for an initial term of 5 years with five 5-year renewable options. Almost all of our leases contain specified rent escalators which average 4% per year, including the option periods. Leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and
revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease agreements. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded in other liabilities (current and long-term).

Cost of site leasing revenue consist of:

•

payments for rental on ground and other underlying property;

•

repairs and maintenance;

•

utilities;

•

insurance; and

•

property taxes.

For any given
tower, such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as additional customers are added.

Our same tower revenue growth and same tower cash flow growth at December 31, 2001, on the 2,390 towers we owned as of December 31, 2000 was 24% and
29%, respectively, based on tenant leases signed and revenues annualized as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Site Development Services

Site development services revenues are also received primarily from wireless communications companies. Our site development
customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. Site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or
a fixed price, or milestone, basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis, we bill the client, and
recognize revenue, based on the completion of agreed upon phases or milestones of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, we recognize the revenue related to that phase. The majority of our site
development services are billed on a fixed basis. Our site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete. Our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by
the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts.
These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The average site development contract for consulting was approximately $233,000 per contract in 2001
and for construction was approximately $45,000 per contract in 2001. Revenue from our site development business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities, which are a function of the timing and amount of our
clients’ capital expenditures, the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period, weather and other factors.

Cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly related to
the projects. All costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred.


We have focused our capital expenditures on building new towers and acquiring existing towers
and related businesses. Our average construction cost of a new tower is currently approximately $275,000 while we believe the industry’s average acquisition cost of a tower over the last two years has been approximately $350,000. As a result of
these favorable economics, we have historically elected to build the majority (59%) of our towers. However, this trend changed somewhat in 2001 as the average acquisition price per tower declined. We acquired more towers than we built in the year
2001.

While we have focused primarily on building new towers for growth, we have also acquired 1,525 towers as of December 31,
2001. Our acquisition strategy has focused on smaller acquisition opportunities from non-carriers and small carrier transactions. We seek to acquire towers where we can increase cash flow to substantially reduce the tower cash flow multiple paid at
acquisition through additional tenant lease up. During the year ended December 31, 2001 we acquired 677 towers. The 677 tower acquisitions were completed at an aggregate purchase price of $222.5 million (exclusive of acquisition costs), an average
price of approximately $329,000 per tower.

In August 2001, we announced that we were adjusting our new tower build construction
plan and operation to produce fewer towers per quarter. In connection with this adjustment, we recorded a $24.4 million charge in the third quarter of 2001. Included in this charge was a write-off of costs previously reflected on our balance sheet
as construction-in-process for certain new tower build sites for which development activity had been abandoned, costs of employee separation for certain employees and costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were
previously utilized primarily in our new asset development activities.

In February 2002, we announced that as a result of
capital market conditions we were further reducing our planned capital expenditures for new tower development activities in 2002 and subsequently suspending any material new investment for additional towers. We have reduced the number of towers
expected to be built or acquired in 2002 to approximately 250 to 350 towers. Under current capital market conditions we do not anticipate building or buying a material number of new towers beyond those we are currently contractually obligated to
build or buy. In connection with this restructuring plan we anticipate incurring charges of between $30.0 million and $65.0 million related to the disposal of new tower build and acquisition construction-in-process, costs of employee separation,
costs associated with the closing of offices and other items. The amount of the charge related to asset disposals will be determined primarily by the fair value of costs of construction-in-process with respect to those new builds we choose to
dispose of. Most of the charge is expected to be incurred in the first quarter of 2002 with the remainder incurred in the second quarter of 2002.

We believe that if the capital markets conditions remain difficult for the telecommunications industry, wireless service providers will choose to conserve capital and may not spend as many dollars as currently
anticipated. We believe our revenues and gross profit from the site development consulting and construction segments of our business may vary in response to the capital markets. Short term, variable capital markets conditions may impact carrier
demand for our tower space. We believe that, over the longer term however, site leasing revenues will continue to increase as carriers continue to deploy new antenna sites to address issues of network capacity and quality, increasing the recurring
revenue stream we enjoy from existing tenants.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As we continue to shift our revenue mix more towards site leasing, operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results. You should be aware of the
dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results. We expect that the acquisitions consummated to date and any future acquisitions, as well as our new tower builds, will
have a material impact on future revenues, expenses and net loss. Revenues, cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest income and interest expense each increased significantly in the year
ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 2000, and some or all of those items may continue to increase significantly in future periods.


Year Ended 2001 Compared to Year Ended 2000

Total revenues increased 44.7% to $242.9 million for 2001 from $167.9 million for 2000. Total site development revenue increased 20.6% to $139.7 million in 2001 from $115.9 million in
2000 due to an increase in site development construction revenue. Site development construction revenue increased 26.0% to $115.5 million for 2001 from $91.6 million for 2000, due primarily to revenues from companies acquired during 2000 and 2001.
Revenues of $34.3 million were contributed by these acquired entities in 2001. Our decision to reduce our level of new tower development activity may have a material adverse effect on our site development revenue in 2002 since, as a result, we do
not expect to perform equipment installation work for as many first tenants as we did in 2001. Site development consulting revenues were $24.3 million for 2001 and 2000. Site leasing revenue increased 98.3% to $103.2 million for 2001 from $52.0
million for 2000, due to tenants added to our towers and the substantially greater number of towers in our portfolio during 2001 as compared to 2000.

Total cost of revenues increased 33.5% to $144.7 million for 2001 from $108.4 million for 2000. Site development cost of revenue increased 21.4% to $107.9 million in 2001 from $88.9 million in 2000 due to higher site
development revenues. Site development consulting cost of revenue increased 9.4% to $17.1 million for 2001 from $15.6 million for 2000, reflecting increased human resources costs. Site development construction cost of revenue increased 24.0% to
$90.8 million for 2001 from $73.3 million for 2000, due to higher site development construction revenues. Site leasing cost of revenue increased 88.3% to $36.7 million for 2001 from $19.5 million for 2000, due primarily to the increased number of
towers owned.

Gross profit increased to $98.2 million for 2001 from $59.5 million for 2000, due to increased site development
and site leasing revenues. Gross profit from site development increased 17.8% to $31.8 million in 2001 from $27.0 million in 2000 due to higher site development revenues. Gross profit margins for site development decreased in 2001 to 22.8% from
23.3% in 2000 due to a greater relative amount of lower margin site development construction business. Gross profit margin on site development consulting decreased to 29.5% for 2001 from 35.6% for 2000. This decrease is attributable to higher costs
and our inability to timely reduce those costs as projects ended. Gross profit margin on site development construction increased slightly to 21.3% for 2001 from 20.1% in 2000. With the expected loss of installation revenues discussed above and
increased competition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain gross profit margins in this range, and we expect site development gross profit margins to settle in the 16% to 19% range as we move through 2002. Gross profit for the site
leasing business increased 104.3% to $66.4 million in 2001 from $32.5 million in 2000. The increased gross profit was due to the substantially greater number of towers owned and the greater average revenue per tower in the 2001 period. The gross
profit margins on site leasing increased to 64.4% for 2001 from 62.5% in 2000. The increase in gross margin was due to additional tenants added to our towers and the resulting increase in average revenue per tower, which was greater than the
increase in average expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, gross profit increased to 40.4% of total revenues in 2001 from 35.4% in 2000 due primarily to increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 48.7% to $41.3 million for 2001 from $27.8 million for 2000. The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses represents the addition of offices, personnel and other infrastructure necessary to support our growth, as well as increased developmental expenses associated with our higher levels of new tower builds and acquisition
activities and an increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2001. Included in selling, general and administrative expense is non-cash compensation expense of $3.3 million for 2001 and $0.3 million for 2000. The increase in 2001 is attributable
primarily to the use of stock and options as payment for certain bonuses. As a percentage of total revenue, excluding non-cash compensation expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 15.7% for 2001 from 16.4% in 2000.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, we recorded a $24.4 million charge relating to a reduction in the scale of
our new tower construction operations. Approximately $24.1 million of this charge related to costs that were previously reflected in our balance sheet as construction-in-process. The remaining $0.3 million related primarily to the costs of employee
separation for 102 employees and the costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were primarily utilized in our new asset development activities.


During 2002 we approved a restructuring plan and anticipate incurring charges of between $30.0
million and $65.0 million relating to a further reduction in our new tower development activities. This charge will be comprised of costs related to the disposal of new tower build and acquisition construction-in-process, costs related to employee
separation, costs associated with the closing of offices, and other items. The amount of the charge related to asset disposals will be determined primarily by the fair value of new tower backlog and construction-in-process with respect to those new
builds we choose to dispose of.

Depreciation and amortization increased to $80.5 million for 2001 as compared to $34.8 million
for 2000. This increase was directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets, primarily towers, we owned in 2001 as compared to 2000. As our fixed assets begin to mature we will be continuing to evaluate the useful lives of the assets and
may decide to change these useful lives based on the circumstances. If the useful lives of assets are reduced, depreciation may be accelerated in future years. Beginning in 2002, as a result of the implementation of SFAS 142, the amortization of
goodwill and certain other intangible assets against earnings will no longer occur. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets during 2001 was $6.9 million.

Operating loss increased to $(48.0) million for the year ended 2001 from $(3.1) million in 2000 as a result of increased depreciation and the restructuring and other charge in 2001.
Other expense, net, increased to $(70.5) million for the year ended 2001 from $(24.6) million for the year ended 2000. This increase is a result of an increase in interest expense due to interest associated with the 10¼% senior notes as
well as increases in other debt balances.

Earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges
and unusual or non-recurring expenses (“EBITDA”) increased 88.0% to $60.2 million for the year ended 2001 from $32.0 million for the year ended 2000. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss available to common
shareholders:

Year Ended 2000 Compared to Year Ended 1999

Total revenues increased 93.0% to $167.9 million for 2000 from $87.0 million for 1999. Total site development revenue increased 91.3% to $115.9 million in 2000 from $60.6 million in
1999 due to an increase in both site development construction revenue and site development consulting revenue. Site development construction revenue increased 115.1% to $91.6 million for 2000 from $42.6 million for 1999, due to the inclusion of
Network Services for an entire year, as well as higher levels of activity. Site development consulting revenue increased 35.0% to $24.3 million for 2000 from $18.0 million for 1999, due to the increased demand for site acquisition and zoning
services from wireless communications carriers. Site leasing revenue increased 96.8% to $52.0 million for 2000 from $26.4 million for 1999, due to tenants added to our towers and the substantially greater number of towers in our portfolio during
2000 as compared to 1999.


Total cost of revenues increased 86.9% to $108.4 million for 2000 from $57.9 million for 1999.
Site development cost of revenue increased 93.9% to $88.9 million in 2000 from $45.8 million in 1999 due to higher site development revenues. Site development consulting cost of revenue increased 25.8% to $15.6 million for 2000 from $12.4 million
for 1999, reflecting higher site development consulting revenues. Site development construction cost of revenue increased 119.2% to $73.2 million for 2000 from $33.4 million for 1999, due to higher site development construction revenues which
resulted primarily from the inclusion of Network Services for an entire year. Site leasing cost of revenue increased 60.7% to $19.5 million for 2000 from $12.1 million for 1999, due primarily to the increased number of towers owned.

Gross profit increased to $59.5 million for 2000 from $29.1 million for 1999, due to increased site development and site leasing revenues.
Gross profit from site development increased 82.9% to $27.0 million in 2000 from $14.8 million in 1999 due to higher site development revenues. Gross profit margins for site development decreased in 2000 to 23.3% from 24.4% in 1999 due to a greater
relative amount of lower margin site development construction business. Gross profit margin on site development consulting increased to 35.6% for 2000 from 30.9% for 1999. This increase is attributable to a change in the mix of our business to
include more multi-purpose projects producing both site development revenue and build-to-suit towers. Gross profit margin on site development construction decreased to 20.1% for 2000 from 21.6% in 1999 due to an increase in the use of subcontractor
labor. Gross profit for the site leasing business increased 127.5% in 2000 from 54.1% in 1999. The increased gross profit was due to the substantially greater number of towers owned and the greater average revenue per tower in the 2000 period. The
increase in gross margin was due to additional tenants added to our towers and the resulting increase in average revenue per tower, which was greater than the increase in average expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, gross profit increased to
35.4% of total revenues in 2000 from 33.4% in 1999 due primarily to increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 40.5% to $27.8 million for 2000 from $19.8 million for 1999. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses represents the addition of offices, personnel and other
infrastructure necessary to support our continued growth, as well as increased developmental expenses associated with our higher levels of new tower builds and acquisition activities. As a percentage of total revenue, selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased to 16.6% for 2000 from 22.7% in 1999.

Depreciation and amortization increased to $34.8
million for 2000 as compared to $16.6 million for 1999. This increase was directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets, primarily towers, we owned in 2000 as compared to 1999.

Operating loss decreased to $(3.1) million for the year ended 2000 from $(7.3) million in 1999 as a result of the increased gross profit in 2000. Other expense, net, decreased to $(24.6)
million for the year ended 2000 from $(26.4) million for the year ended 1999. The decrease is attributable to higher interest income on increased cash balances which more than offset an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense
is due to increased interest associated with the senior credit facility, amortization of deferred financing charges and original issue discount, partially offset by increased interest capitalization as a result of increased construction activity.
The extraordinary item in 1999 of $(1.1) million relates to the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with a prior bank credit agreement. Net loss was $(28.9) million for the year ended 2000 as compared to net loss of $(33.9) million for
the year ended 1999.

Earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and unusual or
non-recurring expenses (“EBITDA”) increased 234.2% to $32.0 million for the year ended 2000 from $9.6 million for the year ended 1999. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss to common shareholders:


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SBA Communications Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries. We conduct
all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, other than financings, is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash
flow generated by these subsidiaries. Even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend. Our
ability to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures related to our senior notes and senior discount notes.

Net cash provided by operations during the year ended December 31, 2001 was $13.0 million as compared to $47.5 million in 2000. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased
interest expense. Net cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2001 was $530.3 million compared to $445.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of tower
acquisitions in 2001 versus 2000. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $516.2 million compared to $409.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in net cash provided by financing
activities in 2001 was attributable to our offering of our 10¼% senior notes closed in February 2001 and borrowings under our senior credit facility.

Our balance sheet reflected negative working capital of $(21.4) million as of December 31, 2001 and negative working capital of $(27.5) million as of December 31, 2000. Our negative working capital balances are
primarily due to the timing of receipts for accounts receivable, payment of accounts payable, accrued expenses and interest payable related to our business operations.

In February 2001, we issued $500.0 million of 10¼% senior notes due 2009, which produced net proceeds of approximately $484.3 million after deducting offering expenses. Interest on
these notes is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2001. The 10¼% senior notes are unsecured and are

pari passu

in right of payment with our other existing and future senior indebtedness. The
10¼% senior notes place certain restrictions on, among other things, the incurrence of debt and liens, issuance of preferred stock, payment of dividends or other distributions, sale of assets, transactions with affiliates, sale and leaseback
transactions, certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other entities.

At December 31, 2001 we had
$500.0 million outstanding on our 10¼% senior notes. The 10¼% senior notes mature February 1, 2009. Additionally, at December 31, 2001, we had $234.9 million outstanding on our 12% senior discount notes, net of unamortized original issue
discount of $34.1 million. The 12% senior discount notes mature on March 1, 2008.

In June 2001, SBA Telecommunications, Inc.,
our principal subsidiary, entered into a $300.0 million senior secured credit facility. The facility provides for a $100.0 million term loan and a $200.0 million revolving loan, the availability of which is based on compliance with certain
covenants. SBA Telecommunications drew the full $100.0 million of the term loan during 2001 as well as $10.0 million of the revolver. The term loan and the


revolving loan mature June 15, 2007 and repayment of the term loan begins in September 2003. Borrowings under the senior credit facility accrue interest at the euro dollar rate plus a margin or a
base rate plus a margin, as defined in the agreement. The senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of SBA Telecommunications and its subsidiaries. The facility also places certain restrictions on, among other things, the
incurrence of debt and liens, the sale of assets, capital expenditures, transactions with affiliates, sale and lease-back transactions and the number of towers that can be built without anchor tenants. As of December 31, 2001 we were in full
compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility and the remaining $190.0 million under the senior credit facility was available to us. At December 31, 2001, we had the $100.0 million term loan outstanding under the senior
credit facility at variable rates of 4.76% to 4.87% and $10.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a 6.5% variable rate.

Our cash capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $530.3 million which was principally used for the construction and acquisition of new towers in our portfolio and the acquisition of two site
development construction companies. We currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during the year ending December 31, 2002 of $85.0 million to $135.0 million. All of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on
hand, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility. The exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support or increase our tower portfolio.

In order to manage our indebtedness we may from time to time sell assets, issue equity, or repurchase, restructure or refinance
some or all of our debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal, or to pay interest on, our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations (including the 10¼% senior notes or the 12% senior discount
notes), or to fund planned capital expenditures, will depend on our future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.

We have on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) shelf registration statements on Form S-4
registering up to a total of 8.0 million shares of Class A common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services at various locations in the United States.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, we issued 1.6 million shares of Class A common stock under these registration statements in connection with six acquisitions and certain earn-outs. As of December 31, 2001, we had 5.7 million shares of Class
A common stock remaining available under these shelf registration statements. Subsequent to December 31, 2001 we issued 587,260 shares under these shelf registration statements in connection with certain earn-outs.

We have on file with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement registering the sale of up to $252.7 million of any combination of the
following securities: Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares or warrants.

INFLATION

The impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. However, we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future
will not adversely affect our operating results.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of
all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management’s judgement in their
application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is
discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on


the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, beginning on page F-7. Note that
our preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight-line
basis over the term of the related lease agreements. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded in other liabilities.

Site development projects in which the Company performs consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are
rendered. For those site development contracts in which the Company performs work on a fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon
the completion of each phase on a per site basis, the Company recognizes the revenue related to that phase. Revenue related to services performed on uncompleted phases of site development projects was not recorded by the Company at the end of the
reporting periods presented as it was not material to the Company’s results of operations. Any estimated losses on a particular phase of completion are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident. Site development projects
generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be
the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “Costs and estimated earnings
in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents
billings in excess of revenues recognized.

Cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all
material costs, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects. All costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as
incurred. Cost of site leasing revenue include rent, maintenance and other tower expenses. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. We continuously monitor collections and payments from
our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and
the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. Our accounts receivable balance was $56.8 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.6 million as of
December 31, 2001.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of
the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease. We perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated
based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset, industry practice and asset maintenance policies. Maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred.


Asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows:

Towers and related components

2 – 15 years

Furniture, equipment and vehicles

2 –   7 years

Buildings and improvements

5 – 26 years

Capitalized costs incurred subsequent to when an asset is originally placed in
service are depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset. Changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively, with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated
over the revised remaining useful life term. We reduced the useful lives on 134 towers. This change in useful lives did not have a material impact in 2001.

Goodwill

We continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of
useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill. The conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant negative trend in our operating results or cash flows, a decrease in
demand for our services, a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors. We measure impairment of unamortized goodwill utilizing the undiscounted cash flow method over the remaining estimated life. Any impairment
loss would be calculated as the amount which the carrying amount of the unamortized balance exceeds its fair value. As of December 31, 2001, we determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill.

We expect to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”) in the first
quarter of 2002. With the adoption of SFAS 142, we will assess the impact based on a two-step approach to assess goodwill based on applicable reporting units and will reassess any intangible assets, including goodwill, recorded in connection with
our previous acquisitions. We had recorded approximately $6.9 million of amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded approximately $10.0 million of amortization during 2002. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform
an initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter. We are currently assessing, but have not yet determined the impact adoption of SFAS 142 will have on our consolidated financial statements, however, we
believe it may be material. As of December 31, 2001, we had unamortized goodwill and covenants not to compete of $86.2 million.

Accounting for Income
Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income
taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent
we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of
operations.

Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets
and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $72.0 million as of December 31, 2001, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred
tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating losses carried forward before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that
actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations. The net deferred tax liability
as of December 31, 2001 was $18.4 million.


Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These instruments arise from transactions entered into
in the normal course of business. During the year ended December 31, 2001 we were subject to interest rate risk on our senior credit facility. At December 31, 2001 our fixed rate debt consisted primarily of the balance on the 10¼% senior notes
and the accreted balance of the 12% senior discount notes. In the future, we may be subject to increased rate risk on our senior credit facility, interest rate swap or any other further financing we may enter into.

The following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates associated with our existing long-term debt
instruments, assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness:

In January 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our
exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. The notional principal amount of the interest rate swap is $100.0
million. The maturity date of the interest rate swap matches the principal maturity date of the 10¼% senior notes, the underlying debt (February 2009). This swap involves the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without
the exchange of the underlying principal amount. The variable rates are based on six-month EURO rate plus 4.47% and are reset on a semi-annual basis.

Our primary market risk exposure relates to (1) the interest rate risk on long-term and short-term borrowings and on our interest rate swap agreement, (2) our ability to refinance our 10¼% senior notes and our
12% senior discount notes at maturity at market rates and (3) the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and exceed financial covenants. We manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding long-term
and short-term debt through our use of fixed and variable rate debt. While we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial
position on an ongoing basis.

Senior Discount Note Disclosure Requirements

The indentures governing our 10¼% senior notes and our 12% senior discount notes require certain financial disclosures for restricted subsidiaries separate from unrestricted
subsidiaries and the disclosure to be made of Tower Cash Flow, as defined in the indentures, for the most recent fiscal quarter and Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow, as defined in the indentures, for the most recently completed four-quarter period.
As of December 31, 2001 we had no unrestricted subsidiaries. Tower Cash Flow, as defined in the indentures, for the quarter ended December 31, 2001 was $15.7 million. Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $73.3
million.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To SBA Communications Corporation:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation (a Florida corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity (deficit) and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of SBA Communications Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    GENERAL

SBA Communications Corporation (the “Company” or “SBA”) was incorporated in the State of Florida in March, 1997. The Company holds all of the outstanding capital
stock of SBA Telecommunications, Inc. (“Telecommunications”). Telecommunications holds all of the capital stock of SBA Network Services, Inc. (“Network Services”), SBA Leasing, Inc., (“Leasing”), SBA Towers, Inc., SBA
Properties, Inc., SBA Sites, Inc., and certain other tower companies (collectively “Tower Companies”). Network Services holds all of the capital stock of other companies engaged in similar businesses.

Network Services provides comprehensive turn-key services for the telecommunications industry in the areas of site development services for wireless
carriers and the construction and repair of transmission towers. Site development services provided by Network Services include network pre-design, site audits, site identification and acquisition, contract and title administration, zoning and land
use permitting, construction management, microwave relocation and the construction and repair of transmission towers, including the hanging of antennae, cabling and associated tower components. In addition to providing turn-key services to the
telecommunications industry, Network Services constructs many of the newly-built towers that the Company owns.

The Tower
Companies own and operate transmission towers in various parts of the United States and Puerto Rico. Space on these towers is leased primarily to wireless communications carriers.

Leasing leases antenna tower sites from owners and then subleases such sites to wireless telecommunications providers.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the
significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as follows:

a.

Basis of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

b.

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The more significant estimates made by management include the allowance for
doubtful accounts receivable, the costs and revenue relating to the Company’s site development and construction contracts, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and the economic useful lives of towers. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

c.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company classifies as cash and cash equivalents all interest-bearing deposits or investments with original maturities of three months or less, and highly liquid short-term commercial paper.

d.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the
improvement or the term of the lease. We perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over
which services are expected to be rendered by the asset, industry practice and asset maintenance policies. Maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred.

F-7

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows:

Towers and related components

2 –15 years

Furniture, equipment and vehicles

2 –  7 years

Buildings and improvements

5 –26 years

Capitalized costs incurred subsequent to when an asset is originally placed in
service are depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset. Changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively, with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated
over the revised remaining useful life. There has been no material impact for changes in estimated useful lives for any years presented.

Interest is capitalized in connection with the self construction of Company owned towers. The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life.
Approximately $3.5 million of interest cost was capitalized in both 2001 and 2000.

e.

Intangible Assets

Intangible
assets are comprised of costs paid in excess of the fair value of assets acquired (“Goodwill”) and amounts paid related to covenants not to compete, deferred financing fees and deferred lease costs. Goodwill is being amortized over periods
that range from 7 to 40 years. The covenants not to compete are being amortized over the terms of the contracts, which range from 5 to 10 years. Amortization expense was $6.9 million, $3.6 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, unamortized goodwill and covenants not to compete were $86.2 million and $66.2 million, respectively, and are included in intangible assets. Accumulated amortization totaled
$11.2 million and $5.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

f.

Deferred Financing Fees

Financing fees related to the issuance of the senior credit facility, the 10¼% senior notes, the 12% senior discount notes, and the related original issue discount on the 12% senior discount notes, have been deferred and are being
amortized using a method that approximates the effective interest rate method over the length of indebtedness to which they relate. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, unamortized deferred financing fees were $27.8 million and $15.4 million,
respectively, and are included in intangible assets.

g.

Deferred Lease Costs

The
Company defers certain initial direct costs associated with lease originations and amendments and amortizes these costs over the initial lease term, generally five years. Total costs deferred were approximately $1.9 and $1.1 million in 2001 and
2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, unamortized deferred lease costs were $3.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and are included in intangible assets. Accumulated amortization totaled $0.9 million and $0.4 million at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

h.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (“SFAS 121”),

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of,

requires that long-lived assets, including certain
identifiable intangibles, and the goodwill related to those assets, be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset in question may not be recoverable. Management has reviewed the
Company’s long-lived assets and has determined that there are no events requiring impairment loss recognition as of December 31, 2001.

F-8

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred
that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of intangible assets or whether the remaining balance of intangible assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over
the remaining life of the intangible assets in assessing whether an impairment occurred. The Company measures impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.

i.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, which includes cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable, approximates fair value
due to the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s 12% senior discount notes are publicly traded and were trading based on a 14.4% yield at December 31, 2001, indicating a fair value of the notes of approximately $209.8 million. The
carrying value of the discount notes is approximately $234.9 million at December 31, 2001. The Company’s 10¼% senior notes are publicly traded and were trading based on a 13.1% yield at December 31, 2001, indicating a fair value of
the notes of approximately $435.0 million. The carrying value of the notes is $500.0 million at December 31, 2001.

j.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue
from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease agreements. Rental amounts received in advance are deferred and recorded in other liabilities (current and long-term). Deferred revenues of $13.2
million and $7.3 million are included in other current liabilities as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Deferred revenues of $0.4 million and $0.2 million are included in other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

Site development projects in which the Company performs consulting services include contracts on a time
and materials basis or a fixed price, or milestone basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which the Company performs work on a fixed price
basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases or milestones of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, the Company recognizes the revenue
related to that phase. Revenue related to services performed on uncompleted phases of site development projects was not recorded by the Company at the end of the reporting periods presented as it was not material to the Company’s results of
operations. Any estimated losses on a particular phase of completion are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident. Site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to
date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates,
and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues
recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.

In December, 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (“SAB 101”),

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.

SAB 101
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. The Company’s revenue recognition policy is in accordance with the provisions of SAB 101. Adoption of the provisions of SAB 101 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position.

F-9

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all
material costs, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects. All costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as
incurred. Cost of site leasing revenue include rent, maintenance and other tower expenses. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

k.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses represent those costs incurred which are related to the administration or management of the Company. Also included in this category are corporate development expenses
incurred in the normal course of business that represent costs incurred in connection with proposed acquisitions which have not be consummated, and new build activities where a capital asset is not produced, and expansion of the customer base. The
above costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenses of $4.2 million, $2.6 million, and $1.0 million were incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

l.

Restructuring and Other Charge

During 2001, the Company implemented a plan to restructure and reduce its new build construction plan. The plan included the abandonment of certain acquisition and new tower build sites resulting in a noncash pre-tax charge of approximately
$24.1 million.The plan also eliminated 102 operational positions and closed and/or consolidated selected offices. Payments made related to employee separation and office closings were approximately $0.3 million. All amounts related to the plan for
the termination of employees and office closings were paid during 2001.

m.

Income Taxes

The Company
accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109 requires the Company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the
consolidated financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the likelihood of utilization of existing
deferred tax assets, management has considered historical results of operations and the current operating environment.

n.

Reclassifications

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the 2000 and 1999 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2001 presentation.

o.

Loss Per Share

Basic and
diluted loss per share are calculated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,

Earnings per

Share

. The Company has potential common stock equivalents related to its outstanding stock options. These
potential common stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share and the weighted average number of shares used in the computations
are the same for all periods presented. There were

F-10

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3.8 million, 3.1 million and 3.2 million options outstanding at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The computation of basic and fully diluted loss per share is as follows:

p.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company did not have any changes in its equity resulting from non-owner sources and accordingly, comprehensive income (loss) was equal to the net loss amounts presented for the
respective periods in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

3.    CURRENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 138,

Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an Amendment of SFAS 133.

SFAS 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. SFAS 138 addresses a limited number of issues causing implementation difficulties for numerous entities that apply SFAS 133 and amends the accounting and reporting
standards of SFAS 133 for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities. The Company adopted SFAS 138 on January 1, 2001 and there was not a significant impact from the adoption.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,

Business

Combinations

(“SFAS 141”)

. SFAS 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business
combinations and supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 16,

Business Combinations

and SFAS 38

Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased

Enterprises

. All business combinations in the
scope of SFAS 141 are to be accounted for under the purchase method. SFAS 141 became effective June 30, 2001. The adoption of SFAS 141 did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“

SFAS 142

”).

This standard eliminates the
amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets against earnings. Instead, goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will be
written-down against earnings only in the periods in which the recorded value of the asset is more than its fair value. Goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 continued to be amortized through December 31, 2001. Goodwill acquired subsequent to June
30, 2001 was not amortized during the year ended December 31, 2001. The Company will adopt SFAS 142 in the first quarter of 2002. With the adoption of SFAS 142, management will assess the impact based on a two-step approach to assess goodwill
based on applicable reporting units and will reassess any intangible assets, including goodwill, recorded in connection with its previous acquisitions. The Company had recorded approximately $6.9 million of amortization on goodwill and covenants not
to compete during 2001. Management is currently assessing, but has not yet determined the impact

F-11

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

adoption of SFAS 142 will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, however, management believes it may be material. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had unamortized
goodwill and covenants not to compete of $86.2 million.

In June 2001, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued an exposure draft of a proposed Statement of Position (“SOP”) entitled

Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and Equipment

. The proposed SOP
may limit the ability of companies to capitalize certain costs as part of property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”). The proposed SOP would also require that each significant separately identifiable part of PP&E with a useful life
different from the useful life of the PP&E to which it relates be accounted for separately and depreciated over the individual component’s expected useful life. The proposed SOP would be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2002. Management has not determined the effect this SOP, if issued as proposed, would have on the consolidated financial statements, but believes it may be material.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (“SFAS 144”).

SFAS 144 supercedes SFAS 121,

Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed of.

SFAS 144 applies to all long-lived assets (including discontinued operations) and consequently amends APB No. 30,

Reporting Results of
Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business.

SFAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Management has not determined the effect, if any, this
standard will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

4.    ACQUISITIONS

During the year, the Company purchased two site development construction companies. On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired all of the issued and
outstanding stock of Atlantic Telecom Services, Inc. (“Atlantic Telecom”). The Company paid $2.4 million in cash and issued 213,524 shares of its Class A common stock to the shareholders of Atlantic Telecom. In addition, as of December 31,
2001, the former shareholders of Atlantic Telecom were entitled to receive up to $5.0 million as a result of certain 2001 and 2002 earnings targets being met. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired,
or approximately $9.7 million was recorded as goodwill, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.

On June 1, 2001, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Total Tower Service, Inc. (“Total Tower”). The Company paid $12.1 million in cash and issued 200,107 shares of its Class A common stock to the
shareholders of Total Tower. This consideration includes the purchase of real property where the construction company is located, as well as an adjacent tract of land. In addition, the former shareholders of Total Tower may receive additional shares
of Class A common stock valued between $2.5 million and $7.0 million per year based upon varying net income targets being met during the first and second year after the closing date. At the Company’s option, this amount may be paid in cash or
Class A common stock. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, or approximately $10.1 million was recorded as goodwill, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.

Additionally, during 2001, the Company acquired 677 towers and related assets from various sellers. The aggregate purchase
price paid to sellers for these acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $214.4 million in cash and 370,502 shares of its Class A common stock. In addition, the Company issued 790,495 shares of its Class A Common Stock as a result of
towers or businesses it acquired having met or exceeded certain earnings or new tower targets identified in the various acquisition agreements.

The Company accounted for all the above acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired assets and companies are included with those of the Company from the dates of the
respective acquisitions. None of the individual acquisitions consummated during the year was deemed significant

F-12

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

to the Company and accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented for 2001. The acquisitions were paid for from the issuance of Class A common stock, proceeds from debt
offerings, cash provided from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the senior credit facility.

During 2000, the
Company acquired 448 towers and related assets from various sellers, all of which were individually insignificant to the Company. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $174.5 million, which was
paid from proceeds from borrowings, equity offerings, cash provided from operations and cash on hand. The historical results of operations of the assets acquired are not material in relation to the Company’s consolidated financial statements;
accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented for 2000.

During 1999, the Company completed 40
acquisitions consisting of 231 towers and related assets from various sellers, all of which were individually insignificant to the Company. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $80.9 million,
which was paid from cash on hand.

On April 30, 1999, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Network
Services and issued 780,000 shares of its Class A common stock to the former shareholders of Network Services. The former shareholders of Network Services received $2.5 million in cash and 320,000 additional shares of the Company’s Class A
common stock in 1999 and an additional 400,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in 2000, as certain targets were met. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill
and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.

5.    CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company’s credit risks consist primarily of accounts receivable with national and local wireless communications providers and
federal and state government agencies. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and provides allowances for doubtful accounts as required based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific
customers, historical trends and other information. Following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of total revenue derived from such customers:

The Company’s site development consulting, site development construction and
site leasing segments derive revenue from these customers.

6.    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment, consists of the following:

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

10¼% Senior Notes

In February 2001, the Company issued $500.0 million of its 10¼% senior notes due 2009, which produced net proceeds of approximately $484.2 million after deducting offering
expenses. Interest accrues on the notes and will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing August 1, 2001. Proceeds from the senior notes were used to acquire and construct telecommunications towers, repay
borrowings under the senior credit facility, and for general working capital purposes. Approximately $105.0 million of the proceeds was used to repay all borrowing under the senior credit facility, and the senior credit agreement in existence at
that time was terminated. The Company wrote off the deferred financing fees relating to the senior credit facility and recorded a $5.1 million extraordinary loss in the first quarter of 2001 in connection with the termination of this facility.

The 10¼% senior notes contain numerous restrictive covenants, including but not limited to covenants that restrict the
Company’s ability to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions. The ability of the Company to comply with the covenants and other terms of the 10¼% senior notes and to
satisfy its respective debt obligations will depend on the future operating performance of the Company. In the event the Company fails to comply with the various covenants contained in the 10¼% senior notes it would be in default thereunder,
and in any such case, the maturity of a portion or all of its long-term indebtedness could be accelerated.

12% Senior
Discount Notes

In March, 1998, the Company issued $269.0 million of its 12% senior discount notes due March 1, 2008. The
issuance of the senior discount notes netted approximately $150.2 million in proceeds to the Company. The senior discount notes accrete in value until March 1, 2003 at which time they will have an aggregate principal amount of $269.0 million.
Thereafter, interest will accrue on the senior discount notes and will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, commencing September 1, 2003. Proceeds from the senior discount notes were used to acquire and construct
telecommunications towers as well as for general working capital purposes.

The 12% senior discount notes contain numerous
restrictive covenants, including but not limited to covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions. The ability of the Company to
comply with the covenants and other terms of the 12% senior discount notes and to satisfy its respective debt obligations will depend on the future operating performance of the Company. In the event the Company fails to comply with the various
covenants contained in the 12% senior discount notes it would be in default thereunder, and in any such case, the maturity of a portion or all of its long-term indebtedness could be accelerated.

Senior Credit Facility

In June 2001,
Telecommunications entered into a $300.0 million senior secured credit facility. The facility provides for a $100.0 million term loan and a $200.0 million revolving loan, the availability of which is based on compliance with certain convenants. As
of December 31, 2001 the Company had $100.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $10.0 million under the revolving loan. The term loan and the revolving loan mature June 15, 2007 and amortization of the term loan begins in September 2003.
Borrowings under the senior secured credit facility accrue interest at the euro dollar rate plus a margin or a base rate plus a margin, as defined in the agreement. The senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of
Telecommunications and its subsidiaries. The facility also places certain restrictions on, among other things, the incurrance of debt and liens, the sale of assets, capital expenditures, transactions with affiliates, sale and lease-back transactions
and the number of towers that can be built without anchor tenants.

9.    SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

a.

Offerings of Common Stock

On
June 21, 1999, the Company completed an initial public offering of 10.0 million shares of its Class A common stock. The Company raised gross proceeds of $90.0 million that produced net proceeds, after deduction of the underwriting discount and
offering expenses, of $82.8 million. The Company used approximately $32.8 million of these net proceeds to pay all outstanding dividends on all outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A preferred stock and to redeem all shares of the
Company’s Series B preferred stock. The Company also used $46.0 million to repay all revolving credit loans under the senior credit facility. Remaining proceeds were used for the construction and acquisition of towers and for general working
capital purposes. On July 19, 1999, the managing underwriters of the Company’s initial public offering exercised and closed on their over-allotment option to purchase 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock. The Company received net proceeds
of approximately $10.9 million from the sales of shares, which were sold at the initial public offering price of $9.00 per share. These net proceeds were also used for the construction and acquisition of towers and for general working capital
purposes.

In February 2000, the Company completed an equity offering of 9.0 million shares of its Class A common stock. The
Company raised gross proceeds of $243.0 million, which produced net proceeds of approximately $229.5 million, after deduction of the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Company used $70.5 million of these net proceeds to repay all
revolving credit loans under the senior credit facility. Remaining proceeds were used for the construction and acquisition of towers and for general working capital purposes. In February 2000, the managing underwriters of the equity offering
exercised and closed on their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1.4 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. Certain shareholders along with the Company had granted this option to the underwriters in connection with
the equity offering. These certain shareholders satisfied from their shareholdings the exercise of the over-allotment option in full, resulting in no proceeds to the Company as a result of this exercise.

In July 2000, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the sale of
up to $500.0 million of any combination of the following securities: Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, or warrants. In August 2000, the Company drew down $247.3 million under this universal shelf in
connection with an offering of 5.8 million shares of its Class A common stock, including 750,000 shares issued upon the exercise of the managing

underwriter’s over-allotment option. From this offering, the Company raised gross proceeds of $247.3 million, which produced net proceeds of approximately $236.0 million, after deduction of
the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Company used $25.0 million of these net proceeds to repay a portion of the term loans under the senior credit facility. Remaining proceeds were used for the construction and acquisition of towers
and general working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2001, the Company may issue under this universal shelf registration statement, any combination of the registered securities, with an aggregate offering price of up to $252.7 million.

b.

Registration of Additional Shares

During 2001, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering an aggregate 5.0 million shares of its Class A common stock. These 5.0 million shares are in addition to 3.0
million shares registered during 2000. These shares may be issued in connection with acquisitions of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company issued 1.6 million
shares of its Class A common stock pursuant to these registration statements in connection with six acquisitions and certain earn-outs. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company issued 1.0 million shares pursuant to these registration
statements in connection with ten acquisitions. Subsequent to December 31, 2001, the Company issued 587,260 shares under these registration statements for certain earn-outs.

c.

Issuance of Restricted Stock

In September 2000, the Company granted 20,000 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Company’s 1999 Equity Participation Plan. These restricted shares have a three year vesting period. Deferred compensation representing the
fair value of the shares on the date of grant was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital and compensation expense is being recognized over the vesting period.

On September 30, 2000, the Company issued 400,000 restricted shares of Class A common stock to the former shareholders of Network Services in accordance with the terms of the
acquisition.

d.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 1999 Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”). A total of 500,000 shares of Class A common stock are reserved for purchase under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan
permits eligible employee participants to purchase Class A common stock at a price per share which is equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the Class A common stock on the first or the last day of an offering period. As of December
31, 2001, employees had purchased 110,491 shares under the Purchase Plan.

e.

Redeemable Preferred Stock

In 1997, the Company sold 8,050,000 shares of 4% Series A preferred stock, convertible initially into one share of the Company’s Class A common stock and one share of the Company’s 4% Series B redeemable preferred stock, to a
syndicate of institutional investors. The Series A preferred stock had a conversion price of $3.73 and net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the shares was approximately $27.0 million (net of approximately $2.4 million of issuance
costs charged to retained earnings). Each holder of Series A preferred stock had the right to convert these shares at any time into one share of Class A common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution protection provisions, and one share of Series B
preferred stock. The Series A preferred stock automatically converted into Class A common stock and Series B preferred stock upon initial public offering.

F-17

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The holders of outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock were entitled, in
preference to the holders of any and all other classes of capital stock of the Company, to receive, out of funds legally available therefore, cumulative dividends on the Series A preferred stock in cash, at a rate per annum of 4% of the Series A
subject to pro-ration for partial years. The liquidation amount equals the sum of $3.73 and any accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A preferred stock. Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series A preferred stock were paid upon the
conversion of the Series A preferred stock into Class A common dividends on the Series A preferred stock were paid upon the conversion of the Series A preferred stock into Class A common stock and Series B preferred stock. On June 21, 1999, the date
of the conversion, accrued dividends of approximately $2.8 million were paid to the holders of the Series A preferred stock. The Company had accrued the preferred stock dividends on the effective interest method over the period from issuance until
the scheduled redemption. As a result, in 1999 the Company recorded a reduction in the amount of dividends payable of $0.7 million as a result of the early conversion and redemption prior to the originally scheduled redemption date.

f.

Exercise of Warrants

In
February 2000, the holders of warrants exercised, pursuant to a cashless option, warrants issued in 1997 to purchase 402,500 shares of SBA’s Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.73 per share. Pursuant to the cashless exercise option,
the Company issued 357,387 shares of Class A common stock and the holders surrendered warrants to purchase 45,113 additional shares as consideration.

10.    STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

In 1996, certain of the Company’s senior executives
terminated existing employment, incentive and option agreements in exchange for new employment agreements and immediately exercisable options to purchase 1,425,000 shares of Class A common stock. All of the options are exercisable at $.05 per share.
As of December 31, 2001, 84,764 of the initial options remain outstanding.

The Company has three stock option plans (the 1996
Stock Option Plan, the 1999 Equity Participation Plan and the 2001 Equity Participation Plan), whereby options (both non-qualified and incentive stock options), stock appreciation rights and restricted stock may be granted to directors, employees
and consultants. Upon adoption of the 2001 Equity Participation Plan, all unissued options under the 1996 Stock Option Plan and the 1999 Equity Participation Plan were cancelled. A total of 5,000,000 shares of Class A common stock were reserved for
issuance under the 2001 Equity Participation Plan. A summary of shares reserved for future issuance under these plans is as follows:

These options generally vest between three and six year periods from the date of
grant. The Company accounts for these plans under APB Opinion No. 25

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

under which compensation cost is not recognized on those issuances where the exercise price equals or exceeds the market price of
the underlying stock on the grant date. From time to time options to purchase Class A common stock have been granted under the 1999 Equity Participation Plan and the 2001 Equity Participation Plan which the Company believed were below market value
at the time of grant. The Company recorded non-cash compensation expense of $3.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Had compensation cost for the stock option plan been determined based on fair

for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The effect of applying SFAS 123 in this pro-forma disclosure is not necessarily indicative of future results.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The components of the net deferred income tax asset (liability) accounts are as
follows:

In connection with the acquisition of certain towers during 2001, the Company
recorded deferred tax liabilities of $4.6 million related to book/tax basis difference in the acquired towers. In connection with the acquisition of certain towers during 2000, the Company recorded deferred tax liabilities and goodwill of $10.5
million related to the book/tax basis differences in the acquired towers.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets as management believes that it is not “more likely than not” that the Company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to recognize the assets.

The Company has available at December 31, 2001, a net operating tax loss carry-forward of approximately $150.2 million. Approximately $12.0 million,
$35.8 million and $102.4 million of the net operating tax loss carry-forwards will expire in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

12.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

a.    Operating Leases

The Company is obligated under various non-cancelable operating leases for land, office space, vehicles and equipment, and
site leases that expire at various times through September 2093. The annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2001 are as follows:

their base salary and continuation of certain benefits in the event of a termination (as defined by the agreement of such employees).

d.    Litigation

The Company is involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business. While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such matters and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs that may be incurred, management believes the resolution of
such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

14.    QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (unaudited)

During the third quarter of 2001, the Company incurred a restructuring and other
charge of $24.4 million.

15.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

a.

Interest Rate Swap

In
January 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure to interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of its debt from fixed to variable rates. The notional principal amount of the interest rate
swap is $100.0 million. The maturity date of the interest rate swap matches that of the underlying debt. This agreement, which matures in seven years, involves the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without the exchange of
the underlying principal amount. The variable rates are based on six-month EURO plus 4.47% and are reset on a semi-annual basis. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in
accordance with the agreements and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense.

b.

Shareholder Rights Plan

During January 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock. Each of these rights,
which are currently not exercisable, will entitle the holder to purchase one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of the Company’s newly designated Series E Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event that any person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock or commences or announces an intention to commence a tender offer that would result in such person or group owning 15% or more of the Company’s
common stock, each holder of a right (other than the acquirer) will be entitled to receive, upon payment of the exercise price, a number of shares of common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. In order to
retain flexibility and the ability to maximize stockholder value in the event of transactions that may arise in the future, the Board retains the power to redeem the Rights for a set amount. The Rights were distributed on January 25, 2002 and expire
on January 10, 2012, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged or terminated in accordance with the Rights Agreement.

c.

Reduction in Tower Development Activities

In February 2002, the Company announced that it was further reducing its capital expenditures for new tower development activities in 2002 and suspending any material new investment for additional towers. The Company
anticipates reducing the number of towers expected to be built or acquired in 2002 from 400 to 600 to approximately 250 to 300. Under current capital markets conditions, the Company does not anticipate building or buying a material number of new
towers beyond those it is currently contractually obligated to build or buy. The Company expects approximately 90 to 110 new towers to be built or acquired in the first quarter of 2002, and the remainder of its obligations to build or buy towers to
be satisfied later in 2002. A portion of its workforce will be reduced, and certain offices will be closed, substantially all of which were primarily dedicated to new tower development activities. The Company anticipates incurring charges related to
this restructuring plan of $30.0 million and $65.0 million for costs related to the disposal of new tower build and acquisition construction-in-process, costs of employee separation, cost associated with the closing of offices and other items.
The amount of the charge related to asset disposals will be determined primarily by the fair value of new tower backlog and construction-in-process with respect to those locations the Company chooses to dispose of. Most of this charge is expected to
be incurred in the first quarter of 2002 with the remainder incurred in the second quarter of 2002.
