ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in 47 of the 48 contiguous United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. Our principal business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 97.6% of our segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2008. In our site leasing business, we lease antenna space to wireless service
providers on towers and other structures that we own, manage or lease from others. The towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider, constructed based on our own initiative or acquired. As of
December 31, 2008, we owned 7,854 towers, the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to wireless service providers. We also manage or
lease approximately 4,200 actual or potential communications sites, of which approximately 600 are revenue producing. Our second business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and
maintaining their own wireless service networks.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts.
Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. Wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us, each of which relates to
the lease or use of space at an individual tower site. Tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which
average 3%– 4% per year, including the renewal option periods.

As of December 31, 2008, we owned 7,854 towers, up from
6,220 as of December 31, 2007. Due to the recent instability in the credit markets and the challenging macroeconomic environment in the U.S., we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio modestly in 2009. We intend to obtain this
modest growth primarily through new tower builds. Pursuant to our historical growth initiatives, we built 85 towers and acquired 1,560 towers during 2008, compared to the year ended 2007 where we built 61 towers and acquired 612 towers.

In addition, in late 2008 as part of our acquisition of Light Tower Wireless, LLC (“Light Tower”) we acquired five distributed
antenna system (“DAS”) networks. The DAS networks constitute our first experience offering this type of wireless service. DAS is a low visibility network that uses hub and spoke architecture to connect base station equipment to a low
power, fiber-optic-fed network. DAS is a complement to traditional tower leasing in areas with challenging zoning regulations or physical obstructions that significantly degrade or restrict coverage. DAS networks can be deployed by attaching the
discrete radio-frequency equipment to existing structures, such as utility poles and street lights.

In our new build program, we construct
towers in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under build-to-suit arrangements. Under build-to-suit arrangements, we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified. We retain ownership of the tower
and the exclusive right to co-locate additional tenants on the tower. When we construct towers in locations chosen by us, we utilize our knowledge of our customer’s network requirements to identify locations where, we believe, multiple wireless
service providers need, or will need, to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands. We seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete pre-construction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing
efforts. We intend to have at least one signed tenant lease on each new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants. We intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2009.

In our tower acquisition program, we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns. For each
acquisition, we prepare various analyses that include projections of



a five-year unlevered internal rate of return, review of available capacity, future lease up projections and a summary of current and future
tenant/technology mix. Due to the current economic environment, we currently intend to limit our acquisition strategy to acquisitions for stock consideration that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both short and long-term and which
meet our investment returns and criteria. We intend to resume acquisitions for cash at such time as we see sufficient improvement in the credit markets.

The table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower portfolio over the past three years.

(1)

2008 includes 528 towers acquired in the Optasite acquisition, 423 towers acquired in the Tower Co. acquisition and 340 towers acquired in the Light Tower acquisition.

(2)

Reclassifications reflect the combination for reporting purposes of multiple tower structures on a single parcel of real estate, which we market and customers view as a single
location, into a single owned tower site. Dispositions reflect the decommissioning, sale, conveyance or other legal transfer of owned tower sites.

As of December 31, 2008, we had 19,344 tenants on the 7,854 tower sites we owned as of that date, or an average of 2.5 tenants per tower.

Our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. As indicated in the tables below, our site leasing business
generated 83.3% of our total revenues during the past year and has represented 95% or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years.

(1)

Site leasing segment operating profit and total segment operating profit are non-GAAP financial measures. We reconcile these measures and other Regulation G disclosures in this
annual report in the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures.



Site Development Services

Our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business, and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing
revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations. Our site development business consists of two segments, site development
consulting and site development construction, through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of end-to-end services. We principally perform services for third parties in our core, historical areas of wireless expertise,
specifically site acquisition, zoning, technical services and construction.

In the consulting segment of our site development business, we
offer clients the following range of services: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; and (5) assistance
in obtaining zoning approvals and permits. In the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services, including, but not limited to the following: (1) tower and related site construction; (2) antenna
installation; and (3) radio equipment installation, commissioning and maintenance. Personnel in our site development business also support our leasing and new tower build functions through an integrated plan across the divisions.

We provide our site development consulting and construction services on a local basis, through regional offices, territory offices and project offices.
The regional offices are responsible for all site development operations, including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices, and a substantial portion of the sales in such area.

For financial information about our operating segments, please see Note 22 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

Industry Overview

We believe that
growing wireless traffic, the successful recent spectrum auctions and technology developments will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number
of communication sites that they use. First, consumers continue to increase minutes of use, whether through wireline to wireless migration, increasing use of broadband services, new data products or simply talking more. Consumers are demanding
quality wireless networks, and list network coverage and quality as two of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when terminating or changing service. To decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth, wireless carriers have
made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage. Second, we expect that the roll-out of 3G and 4G wireless services by existing carriers will require our customers to add a large number of
additional cell sites and increase the amount of their equipment at current cell sites. The Federal Communications Commission’s (the “FCC”) successful advanced wireless service spectrum auction 66 for advanced broadband services and
the more recent FCC spectrum auction 73, relating to the auction of the 700 MHz band, have provided existing carriers the opportunity to deploy spectrum for 3G and 4G wireless service which will further drive the demand for communication sites.
Finally, the third area of growth in the U.S. market comes from new market launches for emerging carriers in traditional wireless services or new technologies like WiMAX. For example, Leap Wireless and Metro PCS acquired spectrum in auction 66 in
new coverage areas that have led and continue to lead to the launch of brand new networks while Clearwire is in the process of building out new markets as well. Despite the current recessionary conditions affecting the global marketplace, based on
these factors, we believe that the U.S. wireless industry will continue to grow and is well-capitalized, highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services. Therefore, we expect that we will see a multi-year trend of strong additional
cell site demand from our customers, which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us.



Business Strategy

Our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers. Key elements of our strategy include:

Focusing on our Site Leasing Business with Stable, Recurring Revenues.

We intend to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due
to its attractive characteristics such as long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins and low customer churn. The long-term nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site
development business, which is more cyclical. By focusing on our site leasing business, we believe that we can maintain a stable, recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending.

Maximizing Use of Tower Capacity.

We generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of
our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers. Most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost. We actively market space
on our towers through our internal sales force.

Disciplined Growth of our Tower Portfolio

.

During 2009, we intend to
modestly grow our tower portfolio principally through new builds. We have historically used our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity, including borrowings, to build and acquire new towers at prices which allow us to
maintain our long-term target leverage ratios. However, given the recent instability in the credit markets, we have begun to focus some of our available cash resources on reducing our leverage levels. In addition, we may pursue some tower
acquisitions for stock in situations that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both short and long-term and which meet our investment returns and criteria. We intend to resume acquisitions for cash at such time as we see sufficient
improvement in the credit markets. We believe that our tower operations are highly scalable. Consequently, we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Controlling our Underlying Land Positions

. We have purchased and intend to continue to purchase and/or enter into
long-term leases for the land that underlies our towers, to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices. We believe that these purchases and/or long-term leases will increase our margins, improve our cash flow from operations and minimize
our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future. As of December 31, 2008, we own or control, for a minimum period of fifty years, land under 26% of our communication sites.

Using our Local Presence to Build Strong Relationships with Major Wireless Service Providers.

Given the nature of towers as location specific
communications facilities, we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally. Consequently, we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience, expertise and relationships in each of our
local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships. Due to our presence in local markets, we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and
participate in site development projects across our markets.

Capitalizing on our Management Experience.

Our management team has
extensive experience in site leasing and site development. Management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site
development services.



Customers

Since commencing operations, we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large wireless service providers. In both our site development and site leasing businesses, we work with large national providers and
smaller regional, local or private operators.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site
development revenues. The following customers represented at least 10% of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years:

During the past two years, we provided services for a number of customers, including:

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing goals are to:

•

use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with respect to our
owned or managed towers, enabling us to grow our site leasing business; and

•

successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins and/or provide a financial or strategic benefit to
our site leasing business.

We approach sales on a company-wide basis, involving many of our employees. We have a
dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team. Our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office. We also rely on our regional vice presidents, general managers and other
operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers. Our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers. Most wireless service providers have national corporate
headquarters with regional and local offices. We believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters. Our sales
representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate. Our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentive-based goals and measurements.



Our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in Boca
Raton, Florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices. We have a full-time staff dedicated to our marketing and sales efforts. The marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies,
prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals. In addition to our marketing and sales staff, we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and local office levels to identify sales opportunities within
existing customer accounts.

Competition

Site Leasing

– Our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are (1) the large independent tower companies, American Tower Corporation, Crown Castle International and Global Tower Partners, (2) a large number
of smaller independent tower owners, (3) wireless service providers who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers and (4) alternative facilities such as rooftops, broadcast towers and utility
poles. There has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past four years. Specifically, American Tower completed its merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in 2005, we completed our acquisition of AAT Communications
Corporation in 2006 and Crown Castle completed its merger with Global Signal, Inc. in 2007. As a result of these consolidations, American Tower and Crown Castle have substantially more towers and greater financial resources than we do. Wireless
service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do. We believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service to our tenants, and, to a lesser
extent, price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business.

Site
Development

– The site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive. We believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively, while some firms
appear to offer their services nationally, including Bechtel Corporation, Black & Veatch Corporation, Goodman Networks, General Dynamics Corporation, Nsoro, and Wireless Facilities, Inc. The market includes participants from a variety of
market segments offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site development consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower
owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors, which provide end-to-end site development services through multiple subcontractors, and wireless service providers’ internal staff. We believe that
providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria, including a company’s experience, track record, local reputation, geographic reach, price and time for completion of a project.

Employees

Our executive, corporate development,
accounting, finance, human resources, legal and regulatory, information technology and site administration personnel, and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida. Certain sales, new tower build support
and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our Boca Raton office. Our remaining employees are based in our regional and local offices.

As of December 31, 2008, we had 627 employees, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Regulatory and Environmental Matters

Federal Regulations.

Both the Federal Communications
Commission (the “FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas. Many FAA requirements are implemented in FCC
regulations. These regulations govern the construction, lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures, require prior approval and registration of towers
or structures before they may be constructed, altered or used.



Wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent
customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used. In addition, any applicant for an FCC antenna tower or structure registration must certify that, consistent with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, neither the
applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of Federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the FCC, in conjunction with the FAA, has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures.
These standards mandate that the FCC and the FAA consider the height of the proposed tower or structure, the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or man-made obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways
and airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. The FAA may condition its issuance of a no-hazard
determination upon compliance with specified lighting and/or painting requirements. Antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the FCC. A tower or structure that requires FAA clearance will not be
registered by the FCC until it is cleared by the FAA. Upon registration, the FCC may also require special lighting and/or painting. Owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and
lighting or other marking in conformance with FAA and FCC regulations. Antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the FAA
of any lighting outage or malfunction.

Owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to, and therefore must comply
with, environmental laws. Any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, among other statutes, which requires federal agencies to evaluate
the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances. The FCC has issued regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. These regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental
effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operation of wireless
communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure. In the event the FCC determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the FCC has developed, the FCC would
be required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which will be subject to public comment. This process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure.

We generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction, modification, or
placement of antenna towers or structures. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties.

The
Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction, modification and placement of towers. The law, however, limits local zoning authority by
prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of radio communication towers. Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires
the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities. This may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available
for tower facilities.

Our DAS network provides service providers with facilities to offer various wireless communications services. We
therefore offer facilities supporting other communications services, providing service within a state as a competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”). CLEC status enables us to negotiate access to utility poles and conduits on fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, consistent with the Communications Act and applicable state law. In a number of states, we must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authority to provide CLEC service.
Additionally, as a CLEC, federal regulation requires us to comply with regulatory and filing requirements of a ministerial nature.



As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose
strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination and related personal or property damage. We are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement, including pre-construction
environmental studies. Operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency (“RF”) emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements. Certain proposals to operate
wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to RF emissions. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can
produce negative health effects. The potential connection between low-level RF energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We
believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws. These costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material
adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

State and Local Regulations.

Most states regulate
certain aspects of real estate acquisition, leasing activities and construction activities. Where required, we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents, who may
be our employees or hired as independent contractors, and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors, who may be our employees or independent contractors. Local regulations include city and other
local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local
officials or community standards organizations, or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures. In addition, many local zoning authorities
require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations. Local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of
the height and visibility of the towers or structures, and have, in some instances, instituted moratoria.

Backlog

Backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments, which have been signed, but have not yet commenced. As of
December 31, 2008, we had 338 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases contractually provided for approximately $8.3 million of annual revenue. By comparison, at
December 31, 2007 we had 265 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases contractually provided for approximately $5.9 million of annual revenue.

Our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts. As of December 31,
2008, we had approximately $17.4 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately $40.6 million as of December 31, 2007.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Business

We have a substantial level of indebtedness, a large portion of which we will need to refinance in the next three years. In the event we are not able to refinance
or repay such indebtedness, we may not be able to access the cash flow from all of our towers and we may need to take certain actions to service our debt obligations.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness (approximately $2.55 billion as of December 31, 2008), and we anticipate refinancing a significant
amount of this indebtedness within the next three years. As of February 24, 2009, we had $2.0 billion of indebtedness outstanding that has an initial or anticipated maturity date within the next three years, including $391.8 million of our 2005
Commercial Mortgage-Backed Pass-Through Certificates (which have an anticipated repayment date of November 2010), $1.1 billion of our 2006 Commercial Mortgage-Backed Pass-Through Certificates (which have an anticipated repayment date of November
2011), $104.2 million of 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due November 2010, $230.6 million of borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and $149.0 million under our credit facility assumed in the Optasite acquisition (the
“Optasite Credit Facility”) (each facility matures in 2010).

If our CMBS Certificates are not fully repaid by their anticipated
repayment dates, November 2010 for the 2005 CMBS Certificates and November 2011 for the 2006 CMBS Certificates, then the interest rates on each of the CMBS Certificates, on such date, will increase by the greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the
amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such
component. Such additional interest will accrue and be payable once the principal of all CMBS Certificates are repaid. Furthermore, if our 2005 CMBS Certificates are not fully repaid by November 2010, then substantially all of the cash flows
from the 4,969 towers owned by the borrowers under the CMBS Certificates will be trapped by the Trustee and applied first to repay the original cash coupons on the CMBS Certificates, then to fund reserves and administrative costs and then to repay
principal of the 2005 and the 2006 CMBS Certificates in the order of their investment grade (i.e. the 2005-1A and 2006-1A subclasses would have their respective principal repaid equally prior to repayment of the other subclasses of the CMBS
Certificates). If we are unable to repay our 2005 CMBS Certificates on November 2010, then we would only have access to the cash flow generated by the remaining approximately 2,900 towers to repay our other indebtedness and pay all our other
corporate expenses.

During 2007 a crisis began in the subprime mortgage sector of the U.S. economy as a result of credit quality
deterioration and rising delinquencies, and that crisis has continued and strengthened throughout 2008 and into 2009 which has led to continued deterioration of the credit markets, a closing up of the debt markets and widening credit spreads. Also
stemming from this crisis, the U.S. economy is undergoing a period of recession, slowdown and high volatility. This crisis has adversely impacted our access to capital, and there can be no assurance that this crisis will not worsen or impact the
availability or cost of debt financing in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effect the anticipated refinancing described above on terms as favorable as our current debt, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.

If we are unable to refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will generate enough cash flow from operations or that we will be able
to obtain enough capital to service our debt obligations and fund our planned capital expenditures. In such event, we might need to sell certain assets or lines of business, issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock to fulfill
our debt obligations. If implemented, these actions could negatively impact our business or dilute our existing shareholders.



We have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability
to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.

As indicated below, we have and will continue to have a
significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. The following table sets forth our total debt and shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2007 and 2008.

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate
cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest or other amounts when due. Subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be
secured debt. This may have the effect of increasing our total leverage.

As a consequence of our indebtedness, (1) demands on our
cash resources may increase, (2) we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (3) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations
including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. For example, as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the U.S. economy:

•

we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that
would be in our best long-term interests;

•

we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available
cash flow to fund other investments, including capital expenditures;

•

we have already reduced our annual tower acquisition goals and may, in the future, be required to reduce our annual tower new build goals;

•

we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;

•

we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and

•

we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations.

These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing,
new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities.

In addition, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase
interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under our senior secured revolving credit facility and our Optasite Credit Facility assumed in the Optasite acquisition and may make it difficult to refinance our
existing indebtedness, including our CMBS Certificates at a commercially reasonable rate or at all. There is no guarantee future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal
to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness.



Any slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could adversely affect our future
growth and revenues.

Demand for antenna space on our towers and for our site development services depends on demand for wireless
services. From 2001 through 2003, economic downturns in the U.S. economy, including the wireless telecommunications industry, negatively influenced demand for tower space and site development services. The current economic downturn in the U.S.
economy and similar slowdowns in the future may adversely affect:

•

consumer demand for wireless services;

•

the financial condition of wireless service providers;

•

the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures;

•

the availability and cost of capital, including interest rates;

•

volatility in the equity and debt markets; and

•

the willingness of our tenants to renew their leases for additional terms.

As a result of these factors wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3G, 4G or other
wireless services or, worse, elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses.

We may not secure as many site
leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline.

If tenant demand for tower space or our lease
rates on new leases decrease, we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected. This may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual
obligations. Our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers.

If our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness
could be adversely affected.

Demand for our services may decline if there is additional significant consolidation among our
wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate or fail to renew existing leases for tower space because many of their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap. As a result of regulatory
changes in January 2003 which removed prior restrictions on wireless service providers from owning more than 45 MHz of spectrum in any given geographical area, there have been significant consolidations of the large wireless service providers.
Specifically, Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless in October 2004 and Sprint PCS and Nextel merged to form Sprint Nextel Corporation in August 2005. As a result of the Cingular/AT&T Wireless merger, as of December 31, 2008, AT&T had
terminated 307 tenant leases with us, which had $7.7 million of annualized rental revenue, on towers where both Cingular and AT&T Wireless had previously had antennas. In addition, AT&T did not renew certain tenant leases for other
communication sites in close proximity to the extent that it believed it did not need the additional capacity. Although we have not currently experienced any significant amount of churn as a result of the Sprint/Nextel merger, due primarily to the
different technologies utilized and their decision to operate two networks, we may in the future experience terminations and/or non-renewals due to this merger. Furthermore, to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the
future, they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as much space on our towers in the future. This would adversely affect our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness.



Similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or
resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space. Wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate
customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services. Wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communication sites owned or controlled by us or others.
The proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.

Delays or changes in the deployment or adoption
of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate.

There can be no
assurances that 3G, 4G or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. The deployment of 3G has already experienced significant
delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries. The announcement of 4G is relatively new and its deployment has been limited to date. Additionally, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for
these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may
not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue, therefore if
any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. The loss of any one of our significant customers, as a result of bankruptcy, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise could
materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth.

The following is a list of significant customers (representing
at least 10% of revenue in any of the last three years) and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers:



We also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments:

Revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site
development contracts. Each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. However, if any of our
significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth
and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a
customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. In addition, a customer’s need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. Furthermore,
our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects.

Increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us.

Our industry is highly competitive. Competitive pressures for tenants could adversely affect our lease rates. In addition, the
loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues, margins and financial condition.

In the site leasing business, we compete with:

•

wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers;

•

other large independent tower companies;



•

smaller local independent tower companies; and

•

alternative facilities such as rooftops, broadcast towers and utility poles.

There has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past three years. Specifically, American Tower Corporation
completed its merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in 2005, we completed our acquisition of AAT Communication Corporation in 2006 and Crown Castle International completed its merger with Global Signal, Inc. in 2007. As a result of these consolidations,
American Tower and Crown Castle are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us. This could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability
to acquire available towers.

Wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially
larger and may have greater financial resources than we do. We believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price historically have been and will continue to be the most
significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business.

The site development segment of our industry is also extremely
competitive. There are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business. As a result of this competition, margins in this segment continue to be under pressure. Many of our
competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable. If margins in this segment were to further decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating
profit could be adversely affected.

The market price of our Class A common stock could be affected by significant volatility, which could
adversely impact our ability to use equity to fund our growth plan.

The market price of our Class A common stock has
historically experienced significant fluctuations. Since the fall of 2008, the U.S. stock market has been undergoing a period of very high volatility where changes in the market prices of equity securities have often been abrupt and profound over
short periods of time. The market price of our Class A common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed
elsewhere in “Risk Factors” and in “Forward-Looking Statements.” Volatility or depressed market prices of our Class A common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of Class A common stock,
when they want or at attractive prices. Consequently, volatility of the market price of our Class A common stock may make it less likely that sellers will accept our equity as consideration in connection with our tower acquisitions and may make
it more difficult for us to use our equity to fund our future growth plans. If we were unable to use equity to fund growth of our tower portfolio, we may be required to either use debt to increase our tower portfolio or reduce our anticipated
growth.

Counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to fulfill their obligations and such failure could subject us to
significant costs to replace any such portion of our convertible note hedge transactions or subject us to potential dilution or additional cost, if settled in cash, upon conversion of our convertible notes.

Concurrently with the pricing of our 0.375% Notes and our 1.875% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of
the initial purchasers of both convertible note offerings. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 0.375% Notes is $33.56 per share of our Class A common stock (the same as the initial conversion
price of the 0.375% Notes) and cover 10,429,720 shares of our Class A common stock. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1.875% Notes is $41.46 per share of our Class A common stock (the same
as the initial conversion price of our 1.875% convertible notes) and cover 13,265,780 shares of our Class A common stock.



Since the fall of 2008, global economic conditions and the financial markets have been and continue to be
volatile. Certain financial institutions have filed for bankruptcy, have sold some or all of their assets, or may be looking to enter into a merger or other transaction with another financial institution. As a result of these conditions, some of the
counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to perform their obligations under such instruments. One of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with our 1.875% Notes was with Lehman Brothers OTC
Derivatives Inc. (“Lehman Derivatives”) which covers 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of our Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion. In October 2008, Lehman Derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code which constituted an “event of default” under the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. As a result, on November 7, 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge
transaction with Lehman Derivatives. Based on information available to us, we have no indication, as of the date of filing this Form 10-K, that any party other than Lehman Derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the
convertible note hedge transactions.

If we were to elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives or any
other counterparty, we would incur significant costs to replace such hedge transactions. Additionally, if we do not elect to replace our convertible note hedge transactions that were previously with Lehman Derivatives or any other counterparty fails
to perform its obligations under our outstanding convertible note hedge transactions, we would be subject to potential dilution or additional cost, if settled in cash, upon conversion of the applicable 0.375% Notes and 1.875% Notes.

Increasing competition to acquire existing towers may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio long-term.

Although our current plans only contemplate modest growth of our tower portfolio in 2009, primarily through new tower builds, our ability to achieve
material long-term tower portfolio growth will depend on our ability to acquire towers from third parties. Traditionally, our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies, independent tower developers and
wireless service providers. However, as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these mid-sized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers. Increased competition for acquisitions
may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, higher acquisition prices, reduced willingness of sellers to accept equity as consideration for their towers and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such
towers. Furthermore, to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us. If we are not able to successfully
resolve these issues, we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the long-term.

We may not be able to build as many towers as
we anticipate.

We currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2009. However, our ability to build these new towers is
dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits.

Due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated, the costs of constructing or acquiring these
towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2009. If we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals.

Our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility.

Our senior secured revolving credit facility and the Optasite Credit Facility contain certain restrictive covenants. Among other things, these covenants
limit our ability to:

•

incur additional indebtedness;



•

sell assets;

•

make certain investments;

•

engage in certain restricted payments from SBA Senior Finance to us;

•

engage in mergers or consolidations;

•

incur liens; and

•

enter into affiliate transactions.

These covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. Further, these covenants could have an adverse
effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisitions or other opportunities. If we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under the senior
secured revolving credit facility. In addition, if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness, including under our CMBS Certificates and our Notes, then such default could cause a cross-default under our senior secured revolving credit
facility.

The mortgage loan relating to our CMBS Certificates also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan
borrowers maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum debt service coverage ratio. To the extent that the debt service coverage, as of the end of any calendar quarter, (1) is less than 1.30 times, all cash flow generated by the pledged
towers must be deposited into a reserve account and (2) is less than 1.15 times, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time
as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter. As lease payments from 4,969 towers of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan, if this cash flow was not available to us it would
adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness, other than the mortgage loan, and to operate our business.

New technologies and their use by
carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations.

The emergence of new technologies could
reduce the demand for space on our towers. For example, the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different
transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space. Additionally, the use of technologies that enhance spectral
capacity, such as beam forming or “smart antennae,” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and
therefore reduce demand for our tower space. The development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video, voice and data services by satellites or other
technologies, could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space.

Our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our
business.

We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our only significant asset is and is expected to be the
outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. We conduct, and expect to conduct, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other
distributions from our subsidiaries to us. Additionally, the borrowers on the mortgage loan supporting the CMBS Certificates must repay the components of the mortgage loan. If such



borrowers’ cash flow is insufficient to cover such repayments, we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our
interests in the 4,969 tower sites that secure, along with their operating cash flows, the mortgage loan. Other than the cash required to repay amounts due under the CMBS Certificates, we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash
flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their debt obligations. Our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to repay
our Notes, the components of the mortgage loan pursuant to the CMBS Certificates (other than those entities obligated under the CMBS Certificates), or make any funds available to us for payment. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay
dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility and the CMBS Certificates.

Our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with
regard to such fluctuations.

The demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be
considered indicative of long-term results. Numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including:

•

the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures;

•

the size and scope of our projects;

•

the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’ fiscal year;

•

delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment;

•

seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter;

•

the use of third party providers by our customers;

•

the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development; and

•

general economic conditions.

Although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts. In addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to
forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. Therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services.

We are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses.

We are not profitable. The following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated:

Our losses are principally due to depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, interest
expense (including non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees), and losses from the write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt as well as impairment charges on our towers and auction rate securities in
the periods presented above. We expect to continue to incur significant losses, which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness.



The loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively
affect our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel.
We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. We have employment agreements with Jeffrey A. Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kurt L. Bagwell, our Senior Vice President and Chief
Operating Officer and Thomas P. Hunt, our Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel. We do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. If we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to
find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency
(“RF”) energy.

The government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to RF energy. Exposure to
high levels of RF energy can cause negative health effects. The potential connection between exposure to low levels of RF energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the
scientific community in recent years. According to the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive. However, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular
and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for
wireless communications services. Moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of RF energy and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. If we were subject to claims
relating to exposure to RF energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

Our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business.

We are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business. In particular, both the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and FCC regulate the construction, modification and maintenance of antenna towers and
structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas. In addition, the FCC separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures.
FAA and FCC regulations govern construction, lighting, painting and marking of towers and structures and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure, require registration of the tower or structure. Certain proposals to construct
new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the FAA to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation.

Antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to FAA and
FCC regulations and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. Antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any lighting outages. Certain proposals to operate wireless
communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements. Failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead
to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. In addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our
revenues and cause delays in our growth.

Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive
covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to



obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification. Local regulations can
delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. In addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to
us. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations.

Our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters.

Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. We maintain
insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. We also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and deductibles, to protect us in
the event of an accident involving a tower. A tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on
our operations or financial condition.

We could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are
subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and
exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. As owner, lessee or operator of numerous tower sites, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without
regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The current cost of
complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. However, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. It is possible that
these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have adopted anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
would be beneficial to our shareholders. We adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes. These
provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of
our Class A common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

Our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future.

The issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. We may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control, caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. Depending on our market value at the time of such future
ownership change, an ownership change under Section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income. Currently, we have recorded a full valuation
allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized.



Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause
dilution or adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equity-related offerings.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the Notes, could depress
the market price of our Class A common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our Class A common stock or other equity-related
securities would have on the market price of our Class A common stock.

PROPERTIES

We are headquartered in Boca Raton,
Florida, where we currently lease approximately 73,000 square feet of space. We have entered into long-term leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longer-term. We open and close project
offices from time to time in connection with our site development business. We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably
available in the markets within which we operate.

Our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee interests, leasehold interests
created by long-term lease agreements, perpetual easements, easements and licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. Of the 7,854 towers in our portfolio, approximately 26% are located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to
perpetual easements, and parcels of land that have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 50 years. In rural areas, a wireless communications site typically consists of up to a 10,000 square foot tract, which supports towers, equipment shelters
and related equipment. Less than 2,500 square feet is required for a monopole or self-supporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communication tower sites. Land leases generally have an initial term of
five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years, for a total of thirty years or more.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our
actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in 47 of the 48 contiguous United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our principal business line is our site leasing
business, which contributes approximately 98% of our total segment operating profit. In our site leasing business, we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own, manage or lease from others. The
towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider, built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired. As of December 31, 2008, we owned 7,854 towers. We also manage or lease approximately
4,200 actual or potential communications sites, of which approximately 600 are revenue producing. Our second business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own
wireless service networks.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts. Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless
service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. Wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site. Each
tenant lease is generally for an initial term of five years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3%—4% per year, including the renewal
option periods. Tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded in
deferred revenue.

Cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:

•

Rental payments on ground and other underlying property leases;

•

Straight line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the
minimum lease term (which may include renewal terms) of the underlying property lease;

•

Property taxes;

•

Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);

•

Utilities; and

•

Property insurance.

For any given
tower, such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of other direct
costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower but typically do not make up a large percentage of total operating costs. The ongoing maintenance requirements
are typically minimal and include



replacing lighting systems, painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing. Lastly, ground leases are generally for an initial term of
five years or more with multiple renewable options of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 3% - 4% annually or provide for term escalators of approximately 15%.

Our site leasing business generates substantially all of our segment operating profit. The table below details the percentage of total company revenues
and total segment operating profit contributed by the site leasing business.

Site leasing segment operating profit and total segment operating profit are non-GAAP financial measures. We reconcile these measures and other Regulation G disclosures in this
annual report in the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

We believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues
will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use, network expansion and network coverage requirements. We believe our site leasing business is characterized by
stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal.
Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications.
Furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not re-locate, we have historically experienced low customer churn as a percentage of revenue.

Site Development Services

Our site development business is complimentary to our site leasing
business, and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as
antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations. Our site development business consists of two segments, site development consulting and site development construction, through which we provide wireless service providers a full
range of end-to-end services. We principally perform services for third parties in our core, historical areas of wireless expertise, specifically site acquisition, technical services and construction.

Site development services revenues are received primarily from wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management
services to wireless service providers. Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. Site development projects, both consulting and
construction, include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. The majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis. Time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is
recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered. Our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete. For those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis, we
bill the client, and recognize revenue, based on the completion of agreed upon phases of this project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase, we recognize the revenue related to that phase.

Our revenue from site development construction contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage
of cost incurred to date, compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on
estimates, and the uncertainty



inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. Revenue from our site development construction business may
fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities, which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures, the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period, weather and
other factors.

Cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue includes all costs of materials, salaries and labor
costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects. All costs related to site development consulting contracts and construction contracts are recognized as incurred.

The table below provides the percentage of total company revenues contributed by site development services over the last three years.
Information regarding the total assets used in our site development services business is included in Note 22 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of
operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for
management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks related to these
policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed
discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, included herein. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such
differences could be significant.

Construction Revenue

Revenue from construction projects is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for
each contract. This method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each
contract nears completion. The asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “billings in excess of
costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and
maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our
allowance is a matter of judgment.



Asset Impairment

We evaluate the potential impairment of individual long-lived assets, principally the tower sites. We record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or intangible assets has been impaired, such
that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site. We consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment, including but not limited to: general
market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for purposes of calculating the
amount of an impairment charge. Changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value which is different from management’s estimates. Future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to
recover the carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. In addition, if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect, a future impairment charge may be required.

Property Tax Expense

We
typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business. As a result, we recognize property tax expense, which is reflected as a
component of site leasing cost of revenue, based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period. We consider several factors in establishing this estimate, including our historical level of incurred property
taxes, the location of the property, our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information. If our estimates regarding anticipated property tax expenses are incorrect, a future increase or
decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended 2008 Compared to Year Ended 2007

Revenues:

Site leasing revenue increased $73.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due to an
increase in the number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our historical towers and from revenue generated by the towers that we acquired or constructed subsequent to December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, we had 19,344
tenants as compared to 15,429 tenants at December 31, 2007. Additionally, we have experienced, on average, higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants, higher annual rents upon renewal by existing tenants and higher rents from
additional equipment added by existing tenants.

Site development consulting and construction revenue for the year ended December 31,
2008 compared to the same period of 2007 decreased $7.0 million as a result of a lower volume of work and a wind down of certain of our prior contracts with Sprint offset by additional contracts with T-Mobile and Metro PCS.



Operating Expenses:

Site leasing cost of revenues increased $8.2 million primarily as a result of the growth in the
number of towers owned by us, which was 7,854 at December 31, 2008 up from 6,220 at December 31, 2007 offset by the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program.

Site development cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $3.4 million compared to the same period of 2007 as a result of a
decline in the volume of work performed for Sprint offset by additional contracts with T-Mobile and Metro PCS.

Selling, general, and
administrative expenses increased $3.3 million primarily as a result of a $0.9 million one-time severance expense related to the departure of our former Chief Financial Officer, a $0.6 million one-time settlement expense associated with the
termination of the pension plan the Company acquired as part of its acquisition of AAT Communications Corporation in 2006 and an increase in salaries, benefits and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of
employees, and increased non-cash compensation expense that we recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007.

Asset impairment of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 is the result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations for eight towers that have not achieved expected lease up results as
determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book value of the tower asset and related intangibles.

Depreciation, accretion and amortization expense increased $42.2 million to $211.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to an increase in the number of towers
and associated intangible assets we owned for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007.

Operating Income:

Operating income was $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $30.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007. The increase of $15.6 million is primarily the result of higher site leasing segment operating profit, offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation, accretion and amortization
expense.



Segment Operating Profit:

The increase in site leasing segment operating profit of $65.6 million is primarily related to
additional revenue generated by the number of towers acquired and constructed for the year ended December 31, 2008, as well as additional revenue from the increased number of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites for the year ended
December 31, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 without a commensurate increase in site leasing cost of revenue. We reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures and provide the Regulation G disclosures in this annual report in the section
titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Other Income (Expense):

Interest income decreased $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to
the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease is primarily the result of lower interest rates coupled with a decrease in the average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $11.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase is primarily
due to the higher weighted average amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, which is partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average cash
interest rate for the same periods. Specifically, we issued $550.0 million of 1.875% convertible senior notes in May 2008, borrowed $465.6 million and paid fees and interest on borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility, which we
entered into in January 2008, and assumed as part of the Optasite acquisition its $150 million fully-drawn credit facility in September 2008.

Non-cash interest for the year ended December 31, 2008 is due to the accretion of interest for the discount on the credit facility which was assumed as part of the Optasite acquisition in September 2008. There was no non-cash interest
for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Amortization of deferred financing fees increased by $3.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily a result of the amortization of fees relating to the senior secured revolving credit facility entered into during the first quarter of 2008 and
the $550.0 million principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes issued in May 2008.



The net gain from extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing fees was $31.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008. The net gain includes $55.6 million associated with the extinguishment of $138.1 million in principal amount of our 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes and $65.5 million of our CMBS Certificates for $147.8 million
in cash. The net gain was offset by a loss of $19.5 million related to the exchange of 3,407,914 shares of our Class A common stock for $73.8 million in principal amount of 0.375% Notes and the write-off of $4.5 million of deferred financing
fees related to the portion of the debt extinguished and the reduction in the aggregate commitment of the lenders under the senior secured revolving credit facility as a result of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc.’s default of its funding
obligations. See discussion in Note 12 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The loss from write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2007 associated with the termination of the senior revolving credit facility in April 2007.

Other expense of $13.5 million and $15.8
million includes an other-than-temporary impairment loss on investments for the year ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, associated with our investments in auction rate securities. See discussion in “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 as well as Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this other-than-temporary impairment charge.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA was $269.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $209.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase of $59.8 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment. We
reconcile this measure and other Regulation G disclosures in this annual report in the section entitled Non-GAAP financial measures.

Net Loss:

Net loss was $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $77.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2007. The decrease of $31.1 million is primarily the result of the net gains from the early extinguishment of debt and an increase in site leasing segment operating profit partially offset by an increase in depreciation, accretion and amortization
expense, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing fees and other expense.

Year Ended 2007 Compared to Year Ended 2006

Revenues:

Site leasing revenue increased $65.6 million due to an increase in the number of tenants and the
amount of equipment added to our historical towers and from revenue generated by the towers that we acquired in our April 2006 acquisition of AAT Communications Corporation (“AAT”) and the other towers we acquired or constructed subsequent
to December 31, 2005. The 1,850 AAT towers were only owned for eight months for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the entire year ended December 31, 2007. The AAT towers contributed



approximately $98.6 million of the total revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 compared to approximately $63.2 million for the same
period of 2006, an increase of approximately $35.4 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had 15,429 tenants as compared to 13,602 tenants at December 31, 2006. Additionally, we have experienced, on average, higher rents per tenant due to
higher rents from new tenants, higher annual rents upon renewal by existing tenants and increased rental rates associated with additional equipment added by existing tenants.

Site development consulting revenue increased $7.7 million as a result of a higher volume of work for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the
same period of 2006. The higher volume of work was primarily due to services provided in connection with Sprint’s development of its network.

Site development construction revenue decreased $16.2 million due to the wind down or completion of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless service providers, as well as a significant decline in the volume of
work performed for AT&T during 2007 as compared to the same period in the prior year.

Operating Expenses:

Site leasing cost of revenues increased $17.3 million primarily as a result of the AAT towers and
the growth in the number of towers owned by us, which was 6,220 at December 31, 2007 up from 5,551 at December 31, 2006. The AAT towers contributed approximately $27.8 million to the total site leasing cost of revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2007 compared to approximately $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $8.2 million.

Site development consulting cost of revenues increased $5.2 million as a result of higher volume of work for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the same period of 2006, largely due to services provided
during 2007 in connection with Sprint’s development of its network. Site development construction cost of revenue decreased $15.8 million due to the wind down or completion of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless
service providers, as well as a significant decline in the volume of work performed for AT&T for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in the prior year.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $3.3 million primarily as a result of an increase in salaries, benefits, and other back office
expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees, a significant portion of which is attributable to the AAT Acquisition. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were also impacted by $6.3 million of stock option and employee
stock purchase plan expense that we recognized for the year ended December 31, 2007 in accordance with SFAS 123R as compared to $5.3 million in the comparable period in 2006, an increase of $1.0 million.

Depreciation, accretion and amortization expense increased $36.1 million to $169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $133.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $71.2 million was associated with the AAT towers for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus approximately $46.4 million for the comparable period in 2006, an increase of approximately
$24.8 million.



Operating Income:

Operating income was $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase of $10.5 million is primarily the result of higher
revenues without a commensurate increase in cost of revenues in the site leasing and site development consulting segments, offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation, accretion and amortization expense.

Segment Operating Profit:

The increase in site leasing segment operating profit of $48.3 million is primarily related to
additional revenue generated by the increased number of towers acquired in the AAT Acquisition. The AAT towers contributed approximately $70.8 million of the total site leasing segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 as
compared to approximately $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $27.2 million. The remaining increase in our site leasing segment operating profit is due to increased revenue from the increased number
of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the same period in 2006 without a commensurate increase in site leasing cost of revenue. We reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures and provide the
Regulation G disclosures in this annual report in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Other Income (Expense):

Interest income increased $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 when compared to
the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily the result of investment earnings on the net proceeds of the Convertible Senior Notes (the “Notes”) offering completed at the end of the first quarter of 2007.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $11.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase is primarily
due to the higher weighted average amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, which is partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average cash
interest rate for the same periods. Specifically, (1) our $1.1 billion bridge loan for the AAT Acquisition was only outstanding for seven months of the year ended December 31, 2006 and was not outstanding during any portion of the year
ended December 31, 2007, while the



$1.1 billion CMBS Certificates issued in 2006, which were used to refinance the bridge loan, were outstanding for a little over one month for the year ended
December 31, 2006 and were outstanding for the full year ended December 31, 2007, and (2) we had $350.0 million of additional debt outstanding for nine months in 2007 consisting of our 0.375% Notes compared to none in the year ended
December 31, 2006.

There was no non-cash interest for the year ended
December 31, 2007 compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was a result of the repurchase of all of the outstanding 9


/


% senior discount notes in April 2006.

Amortization of deferred financing
fees decreased by $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This decrease was primarily a result of fully amortizing fees relating to the $1.6 billion of CMBS Certificates over a
period of five years, with one year of amortization during the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to fully amortizing fees on the $1.1 billion bridge loan over nine months, with seven months of amortization during the year ended
December 31, 2006.

The loss from write-off of deferred financing fees and
extinguishment of debt was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 associated with the termination of the senior revolving credit facility in April 2007. This amount was $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
associated with the loss from write-off of $10.2 million of deferred financing fees and $47.0 million of losses on extinguishment of debt resulting from the prepayment of the $1.1 billion bridge loan in November 2006 and the repurchase of the

% senior notes and 9


/


% senior discount notes in April 2006.

Other expense of $15.8 million includes an
other-than-temporary impairment loss on short-term investments of $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 associated with our investments in auction rate securities. See discussion in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this other-than-temporary impairment charge.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA was $209.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $161.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
increase of $47.6 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment largely driven from the AAT Acquisition. We reconcile this measure and other Regulation G disclosures in this annual report in the
section entitled Non-GAAP financial measures.

Net Loss:

Net loss was $77.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $133.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease of $55.5 million is primarily the result of the decrease in
loss from write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SBA Communications Corporation (“SBA”) is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Our only significant asset is the
outstanding capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, Inc. (“Telecommunications”) which is also a holding company that owns the outstanding capital stock of SBA Infrastructure Holdings I, Inc. (“Infrastructure,” formerly known as
Optasite) and SBA Senior Finance, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SBA (“SBA Senior Finance”). SBA Senior Finance directly or indirectly, owns the equity interest in substantially all of our non-Infrastructure subsidiaries. We
conduct all of our business operations through our SBA Senior Finance subsidiaries, the primary borrowers under the mortgage loan underlying the CMBS Certificates, SBA Senior Finance II LLC and Infrastructure. Accordingly, our only source of cash to
pay our obligations, other than financings, is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries.



A summary of our cash flows is as follows:

Sources of Liquidity

We fund our growth, including our tower portfolio growth, through cash flows from operations, long-term indebtedness and equity issuances.

Cash provided by operating activities was $173.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $122.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily the result of
segment operating profit from the site leasing segment, net of interest expense and selling, general and administrative expenses.

In
January 2008, SBA Senior Finance entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility. The aggregate commitment of the senior secured revolving credit facility is currently $285 million. The facility may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject
to compliance with certain covenants. Proceeds available under the facility may only be used for the construction or acquisition of towers and for ground lease buyouts. Amounts borrowed under the facility will accrue interest at the Eurodollar rate
plus a margin that ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 50 basis points to 200 basis points, in each case based on consolidated total debt to SBA Senior Finance’s annualized EBITDA
ratio (calculated excluding the impact from the borrowers under the mortgage loan underlying the CMBS Certificates and funds borrowed under the Optasite Credit Facility). The material terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility are
described below under “Debt Instruments – Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.” As of December 31, 2008, $230.6 million was outstanding and $54.4 million was the remaining availability under the facility.

On May 16, 2008, we issued $550.0 million of our 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2013, which we refer to as the 1.875% Notes. Semi-annual
interest payments on the 1.875% Notes are due each May 1 and November 1, beginning November 1, 2008. The maturity date of the 1.875% Notes is May 1, 2013. The 1.875% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares
of our Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 24.1196 shares per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $41.46 per
share or a 20% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $34.55 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2008. The net proceeds from the 1.875% Note offering were approximately
$536.8 million after deducting discounts, commissions and expenses. A portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 1.875% Notes was used to repurchase and retire approximately 3.47 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price
of $34.55 per share, or approximately $120.0 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the sales of the 1.875% Notes and the warrants (see Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) was used to pay for the cost of the convertible note
hedge transactions, repay approximately $235.0 million drawn under the senior secured revolving credit facility, to finance future acquisitions of complementary businesses, to finance future acquisition or construction of towers and the purchase or
extension of leases of land underlying our towers, future stock repurchases and for general corporate purposes. The remainder of the net proceeds from the sale of the 1.875% Notes and the warrant transactions is invested in cash equivalents.



On September 16, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Optasite, we assumed Optasite’s
fully drawn $150 million senior credit facility with Morgan Stanley Asset Funding, Inc. which we recorded at its fair value of $147.0 million. The Optasite Credit Facility is secured by all of the property and interest in property of Optasite
Towers, LLC, a subsidiary of Optasite. Interest on the Optasite Credit Facility accrues at one month Eurodollar Rate plus 165 basis points and interest is paid monthly. Commencing November 1, 2008, we began paying an amount equal to the monthly
percentage share of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Optasite Credit Facility based on a twenty-five year amortization and the facility cannot be re-drawn. The Optasite Credit Facility matures on November 1, 2010, when the
remaining principal will be due in full. The material terms of the Optasite Credit Facility are described below under “Debt Instruments – Optasite Credit Facility.” As of December 31, 2008, there was $149.0 million outstanding
under the Optasite Credit Facility which was recorded at its accreted carrying value of $146.4 million.

In order to manage our leverage
position and to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants, we may decide to pursue a variety of actions. These actions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness to stay at target leverage levels, selling certain assets or
lines of business, issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, or pursuing other financing alternatives, including securitization transactions. If implemented, these actions could increase our interest expense and/or
dilute our existing shareholders. We cannot assure you that we will implement any of these strategies or that, if implemented, these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to our company and its shareholders.

Equity Issuances

We have on file with the Commission
a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 registering shares of Class A common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers, companies who own towers or companies that provide related services.
During 2008, we issued approximately 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock under this registration statement in connection with the acquisition of towers. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 2.6 million shares of
Class A common stock remaining under this shelf registration statement.

On April 14, 2006, we filed with the Commission an
automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers on Form S-3ASR. This registration statement enables us to issue shares of our Class A common stock, shares of preferred stock, which may be represented by depositary shares,
unsecured senior, senior subordinated or subordinated debt securities, and warrants to purchase any of these securities in any amounts approved by our board of directors, subject to the requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the securities and
other laws applicable to us. Under the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements, we will file a prospectus supplement and advise the Commission of the amount and type of securities each time we issue securities under this registration
statement. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we did not issue any securities under this automatic shelf registration statement.

Uses of
Liquidity

Our principal use of liquidity is cash capital expenditures associated with the growth of our tower portfolio. Our cash
capital expenditures, including cash used for acquisitions, for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $620.7 million. The $620.7 million included cash capital expenditures of $564.9 million that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of
1,560 completed towers and earnouts associated with previous acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2008, net of related prorated rental receipts and payments. The $620.7 million also includes $23.5 million related to new tower
construction, $5.1 million for maintenance tower capital expenditures, $6.3 million for augmentations and tower upgrades, $1.3 million for general corporate expenditures, and $19.6 million for ground lease purchases. The $23.5 million of new tower
construction included costs associated with the completion of 85 new towers for the year ended December 31, 2008 and costs incurred on sites currently in process.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we consummated privately negotiated exchanges of stock for outstanding 0.375% Notes in reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pursuant to these



exchanges we issued 3,407,914 shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for $73.8 million in principal amount of 0.375% Notes. We also repurchased
in privately negotiated transactions $138.1 million in principal amount of 0.375% Notes and $65.5 of our CMBS Certificates for $147.8 million in cash. The 0.375% Notes repurchased and exchanged represent 60.5% of the original $350 million principal
amount of 0.375% Notes issued.

From time to time, in order to optimize our liquidity and leverage and take advantage of certain market
opportunities, we have and may in the future repurchase, for cash or equity, our outstanding indebtedness, including our 0.375% Convertible Notes due 2010, our 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 and our 2005 and 2006 collateralized mortgage
backed securities, in privately-negotiated transactions or in open market transactions.

In order to manage our leverage position and/or to
ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants, we may decide to pursue a variety of other financial transactions. These transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness, the repurchase of outstanding indebtedness for cash
or equity, selling certain assets or lines of business, issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, or pursuing other financing alternatives, including securitization transactions. If either our debt repurchases or
exchanges or any of the other financial transactions are implemented, these actions could materially impact the amount and composition of indebtedness outstanding, increase our interest expense and/or dilute our existing shareholders. We cannot
assure you that we will not implement any of these strategies or that, if implemented, these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to us and our shareholders.

Based on the current state of the credit markets, during 2009 we expect to limit our cash capital expenditures to (1) non-discretionary cash capital
expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures, which we expect to be in the range of $6.0 million to $9.0 million in 2009, and (2) discretionary cash capital expenditures primarily associated with the 80 to
100 towers we intend to build in 2009, tower augmentations and ground lease purchases, which we expect to be in the range of $30.0 million to $50.0 million in 2009. If we refinance some of our debt in 2009, we may increase our cash capital
expenditures. In the interim, we may pursue limited tower acquisitions for stock when we can do so on an immediately accretive basis and the acquisition otherwise meets our investment returns and criteria.

We estimate we will incur approximately $1,000 per tower per year for capital improvements or modifications to our towers. All of these planned cash
capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash flow from operations and borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility. The exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors
including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio, our new tower build and tower acquisition program, and our ground lease purchase program.

Debt Service Requirements

At December 31, 2008, we had $398.8 million outstanding of Initial CMBS Certificates. The
Initial CMBS Certificates have an anticipated repayment date of November 2010. Interest on the Initial CMBS Certificates is payable monthly at a blended annual rate of 5.6%. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2008, debt
service for the next twelve months on the Initial CMBS Certificates is $22.3 million.

At December 31, 2008, we had $1.1 billion
outstanding of Additional CMBS Certificates. The Additional CMBS Certificates have an anticipated repayment date of November 2011. Interest on the Additional CMBS Certificates is payable monthly at a blended annual rate of 6.0%. Based on the amounts
outstanding at December 31, 2008, debt service for the next twelve months on the Additional CMBS Certificates is $65.4 million.

At
December 31, 2008, we had $138.1 million outstanding of 0.375% Notes. The 0.375% Notes have a maturity date of December 1, 2010. Interest on the 0.375% Notes is payable semi-annually each June 1 and December 1 at an annual rate
of 0.375%. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2008, debt service for the next twelve months on the 0.375% Notes is $0.5 million.



At December 31, 2008, we had $550.0 million outstanding of 1.875% Notes. The 1.875% Notes have a
maturity date of May 1, 2013. Interest on the 1.875% Notes is payable semi-annually each May 1 and November 1 at an annual rate of 1.875%. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2008, debt service for the next twelve
months on the 1.875% Notes will be $10.3 million.

At December 31, 2008, we had $230.6 million outstanding under our senior secured
revolving credit facility. Amounts borrowed under the facility accrue interest at the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a Base Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) plus a margin
that ranges from 50 basis points to 200 basis points. The facility will terminate and we will repay all amounts outstanding on the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of January 18, 2008 and (ii) the date which is three months prior
to (x) the final maturity date of the 0.375% Notes (or any instrument that refinances the 0.375% Notes) or (y) the anticipated repayment date (November 2010) of the Initial CMBS Certificates (or any other refinancing of these instruments).
However, we may request that each lender, in its sole discretion, extend the termination date of the facility for one additional year. In addition, we had approximately $0.1 million of letters of credit posted against the availability of this
facility at December 31, 2008. Based on the outstanding amount and rates in effect at December 31, 2008, we estimate our debt service for the next twelve months will be approximately $9.9 million.

At December 31, 2008, we had $149.0 million outstanding under our Optasite Credit Facility that was recorded at its accreted carrying value of
$146.4 million. Interest on the Optasite Credit Facility accrues at the one month Eurodollar Rate plus 165 basis points and interest is paid monthly. Commencing November 1, 2008, we began paying an amount equal to the monthly percentage share
of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Optasite Credit Facility based on a twenty-five year amortization and the facility cannot be re-drawn. The Optasite Credit Facility matures on November 1, 2010, when the remaining principal
will be due in full. Based on the outstanding amount and rates in effect at December 31, 2008, we estimate our debt service for the next twelve months will be approximately $4.2 million.

At December 31, 2008, we believe that our cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt
during the next twelve months.

Debt Instruments

CMBS Certificates

On November 18, 2005, SBA CMBS-1 Depositor LLC (the “Depositor”), an indirect subsidiary
of ours, sold in a private transaction $405.0 million of Initial CMBS Certificates issued by the SBA CMBS Trust (the “Trust”).



The Initial CMBS Certificates consist of five classes, all of which are rated investment grade with a
principal balance and pass-through interest rate as indicated in the table below:

The weighted average annual fixed coupon interest rate of the Initial CMBS Certificates as of
December 31, 2008 is 5.6%, payable monthly, and the effective weighted average annual fixed interest rate is 4.8% after giving effect to a settlement of two interest rate swap agreements entered into in contemplation of the transaction. The
Initial CMBS Certificates have an anticipated repayment date of November 2010 with a final repayment date in 2035. The proceeds of the Initial CMBS Certificates were primarily used to purchase the prior senior credit facility of SBA Senior Finance
and to fund reserves and pay expenses associated with the offering.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, SBA repurchased, for cash, $6.2
million in principal amount of Initial CMBS Certificates subclass 1D in privately negotiated transactions. In accordance with APB 26 “Early Extinguishment of Debt,” SBA recorded in its Consolidated Statement of Operations a $0.6 million
gain on the early extinguishment of debt net of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.

On November 6, 2006, the
Depositor sold, in a private transaction, $1.15 billion of Additional CMBS Certificates issued by the Trust. The Additional CMBS Certificates consist of nine classes with a principal balance and pass-through interest rate for each class as indicated
in the table below:

The weighted average annual fixed interest rate of the Additional CMBS Certificates as of
December 31, 2008 is 6.0%, payable monthly, and the effective weighted average annual fixed interest rate is 6.3% after giving effect to the settlement of the nine interest rate swap agreements entered into in contemplation of the transaction.
The Additional CMBS Certificates have an anticipated repayment date of November 2011 with a final repayment date in 2036. The proceeds of the Additional CMBS Certificates were primarily used to repay the bridge loan incurred in connection with the
acquisition of AAT and to fund required reserves and expenses associated with the Additional CMBS Transaction.



During the fourth quarter of 2008, SBA repurchased, for cash, $59.3 million in principal amount of
Additional CMBS Certificates in privately negotiated transactions. In accordance with APB 26 “Early Extinguishment of Debt,” SBA recorded in its Consolidated Statement of Operations an $18.6 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt
net of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.

The assets of the Trust, which issued both the Initial CMBS Certificates and
the Additional CMBS Certificates, consist of a non-recourse mortgage loan initially made in favor of SBA Properties as the initial borrower. In connection with the Additional CMBS Certificates, each of SBA Sites, Inc., SBA Structures, Inc., SBA
Towers, Inc., SBA Puerto Rico, Inc. and SBA Towers USVI, Inc. (the “Additional Borrowers” and collectively with SBA Properties, Inc., the “Borrowers”) were added as additional borrowers under the mortgage loan and the principal
amount of the mortgage loan was increased by $1.15 billion to an aggregate of $1.56 billion. The mortgage loan consists of multiple tranches, or components, each of which has terms that are identical to the subclass of CMBS Certificates to which it
relates. The Borrowers are special purpose vehicles which exist solely to hold the towers which are subject to the securitization.

The
mortgage loan is to be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 4,969 towers owned by the Borrowers (the “CMBS Towers”). Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be
made for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the Initial CMBS Certificates prior to the monthly payment date in November 2010, which is the anticipated repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the
Initial CMBS Certificates, and no payments of principal will be required to be made for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the Additional CMBS Certificates prior to the monthly payment date in November 2011, which is the
anticipated repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the Additional CMBS Certificates.

The Borrowers may
prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part at any time prior to November 2010 for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the Initial CMBS Certificates and November 2011 for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the
Additional CMBS Certificates upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. The prepayment consideration is determined per class and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value on the date of prepayment
of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date that is nine months prior to the anticipated repayment date, assuming the entire unpaid principal amount of such
class is required to be paid, over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment. If the prepayment occurs (i) within nine months of the anticipated repayment date, (ii) with proceeds
received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of the Borrowers’ sites or (iii) during an amortization period, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan components corresponding to
the Initial CMBS Certificates will be due in November 2035 and those corresponding to the Additional CMBS Certificates will be due in November 2036. However, to the extent that the full amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the
Initial CMBS Certificates or the amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the Additional CMBS Certificates are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each component would increase by the
greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the
original interest rate for such component. In addition, if our 2005 CMBS Certificates are not fully repaid by November 2010, then excess cash flow (as defined below) will be trapped by the Trustee and applied first to repay the original cash coupons
on the CMBS Certificates, to fund all reserve accounts, fund operating expenses associated with the towers, pay the management fees and then to repay principal of the 2005 and the 2006 CMBS Certificates in order of their investment grade (i.e. the
2005-1A and 2006-1A subclasses would have their respective principal repaid equally prior to repayment of the other subclasses of the CMBS Certificates). The mortgage loan may be defeased in whole at any time prior to the anticipated repayment
date.



The mortgage loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on
substantially all of the tower sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (3) the Borrowers’ rights under the management agreement they
entered into with SBA Network Management, Inc. (“SBA Network Management”) relating to the management of the Borrowers’ tower sites by SBA Network Management pursuant to which SBA Network Management arranges for the payment of all
operating expenses and the funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on the Borrowers’ behalf, (4) the Borrowers’ right under certain site management agreements,
(5) the Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases, (6) the pledge by SBA CMBS-1 Guarantor LLC and SBA CMBS-1 Holdings, LLC of equity interest of the initial borrower and SBA CMBS-1 Guarantor LLC, (7) the various deposit
accounts and collection accounts of the Borrowers and (8) all proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar month, SBA Network Management is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 7.5% of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for the
immediately preceding calendar month.

In connection with the issuance of the CMBS
Certificates, we established a deposit account into which all rents and other sums due on the CMBS Towers are directly deposited by the lessees and are held by the trustee. The funds in this deposit account are used to fund a restricted cash amount,
which represents the cash held in escrow pursuant to the mortgage loan governing the CMBS Certificates to fund certain reserve accounts for the payment of debt service costs, ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums
related to tower sites, trustee and service expenses, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the 4,969 tower sites. Based on the terms of the CMBS Certificates, all rental cash receipts each month are restricted and held by the
indenture trustee. The monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The monies held by the indenture trustee in excess of required reserve balances are subsequently released to the
Borrowers on or before the 15

th

calendar day following month end. However, if the debt service coverage ratio, defined as the Net Cash Flow (as
defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter,
falls to 1.30 times or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan
documents, referred to as “excess cash flow”, will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the debt service coverage
ratio exceeds 1.30 times for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15 times as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the
reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter.

As of December 31, 2008, we met the required debt service coverage ratio as defined by the mortgage loan agreement.

0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2010

On March 26, 2007, we issued $350.0 million of our 0.375% Convertible Senior
Notes due 2010. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. The maturity date of the Notes is December 1, 2010. The Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of our Class A, common stock, at an initial
conversion rate of 29.7992 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $33.56 per share or a 19% conversion premium based on the last
reported sale price of $28.20 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 20, 2007, the purchase agreement date. The Notes are only convertible under the following circumstances:

•

during any calendar quarter commencing at any time after June 30, 2007 and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our
Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of Class A common
stock on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter;



•

during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of a 0.375% Note for each day in the measurement period
was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate;

•

if specified distributions to holders of our Class A common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur; and

•

at any time on or after October 12, 2010.

Upon conversion, we have the right to settle the conversion of each $1,000 principal amount of 0.375% Notes with either of the three following alternatives, at our option, delivery of (1) 29.7992 shares of our
Class A common stock, (2) cash equal to the value of 29.7992 shares of our Class A common stock calculated at the market price per share of our Class A common stock at the time of conversion or (3) a combination of cash and
shares of our Class A common stock.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 0.375% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge
transactions whereby we purchased from affiliates of two of the initial purchasers of the 0.375% Notes, an option covering 10,429,720 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial price of $33.56 per share. Separately and concurrently with
the pricing of the 0.375% Notes, we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold to affiliates of two of the initial purchasers of the 0.375% Notes warrants to acquire 10,429,720 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial exercise
price of $55.00 per share. The convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, taken as a whole, effectively increase the conversion price of the 0.375% Notes from $33.56 per share to $55.00 per share. As we cannot determine when,
or whether, the 0.375% Notes will be converted, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, taken as a whole, minimize the dilution risk associated with early conversion of the 0.375% Notes until such time that our
Class A common stock is trading at a price above $55.00 per share (the upper strike of the warrants).

During the fourth quarter of
2008, we consummated privately negotiated exchanges of stock for outstanding 0.375% Notes in reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pursuant to these exchanges, we issued 3,407,914 shares of SBA’s
Class A common stock in exchange for $73.8 million in principal amount of 0.375% Notes. In addition, we also repurchased $138.1 million in principal amount of 0.375% Notes for $102.5 million in cash. The notes repurchased represent 60.5% of the
original $350 million principal amount of 0.375% Notes issued. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013

On May 16, 2008 we issued $550.0 million of our 1.875% Convertible Senior
Notes due 2013. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1, beginning November 1, 2008. The maturity date of the 1.875% Notes is May 1, 2013. The 1.875% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into
shares of our Class A common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 24.1196 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial
conversion price of approximately $41.46 per share or a 20% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $34.55 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2008, the purchase agreement
date. The 1.875% Notes are only convertible under the following circumstances:

•

during any calendar quarter commencing at any time after June 30, 2008 and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our
Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of Class A common
stock on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter;

•

during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes for each day
in the measurement period was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate;

•

if specified distributions to holders of our Class A common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur; and



•

at any time on or after February 19, 2013.

Upon conversion, we have the right to settle the conversion of each $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes with any of the three following alternatives, at our option: delivery of (1) 24.1196 shares of our
Class A common stock, (2) cash equal to the value of 24.1196 shares of our Class A common stock calculated at the market price per share of our Class A common stock at the time of conversion or (3) a combination of cash and
shares of our Class A common stock.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 1.875% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge
transactions originally covering 13,265,780 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial price of $41.46 per share. Separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 1.875% Notes, we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold
warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire 13,265,780 shares of our Class A common stock at an initial exercise price of $67.37 per share. The convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, taken as a whole,
effectively increase the conversion price of the 1.875% Notes from $41.46 per share to $67.37 per share. As we cannot determine when, or whether, the 1.875% Notes will be converted, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant
transactions, taken as a whole, minimize the dilution risk associated with early conversion of the 1.875% Notes until such time that our Class A common stock is trading at a price above $67.37 per share (the upper strike of the warrants).

One of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the 1.875% Notes was with Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives
Inc. (“Lehman Derivatives”). The convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives covers 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of Company Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes. In October 2008,
Lehman Derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The filing by Lehman Derivatives of a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition constituted an “event of default” under the
convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. As a result, on November 7, 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. Based on information available to us, we have no indication, as of the
date of filing this Form 10-K, that any party other than Lehman Derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the convertible note hedge transactions.

The net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives was recorded as an adjustment to Additional Paid in Capital and did not
have any impact on our consolidated balance sheet. However, we could incur significant costs to replace this hedge transaction if we elect to do so. If we do not elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction, then we will be subject to
potential dilution upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes, if on the date of conversion the per share market price of SBA’s Class A common stock exceeds the conversion price of $41.46.

Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility

On
January 18, 2008, SBA Senior Finance, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SBA, entered into a $285.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. On March 5, 2008, SBA Senior Finance entered into a new lender supplement in
connection with the senior secured revolving credit facility, which increased the commitment from $285.0 million to $335.0 million. In September 2008, we made a drawing request under the senior secured revolving credit facility and Lehman Commercial
Paper Inc. (“LCPI”), who was a lender under the senior secured revolving credit facility, did not fund its share of such request. As a result of such failure to fund, we delivered a letter to LCPI declaring that LCPI was in default of its
obligations under the senior secured revolving credit facility agreement. On October 5, 2008, LCPI filed a motion for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. LCPI, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc.,
originally had committed $50.0 million of the original aggregate of $335.0 million in commitments under the senior secured revolving credit facility. As a result, the aggregate commitment of the senior secured revolving credit facility is currently
$285.0 million. No lender within the facility is committed to fund more than $50.0 million.

The senior secured revolving credit facility
may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with the financial and other covenants in the Senior Credit Agreement. Amounts borrowed under the facility



accrue interest at the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a Base Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit
Agreement) plus a margin that ranges from 50 basis points to 200 basis points, in each case based on the Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement and discussed below). The facility will
terminate and we will repay all amounts outstanding on the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of January 18, 2008 and (ii) the date which is three months prior to (x) the final maturity date of the 0.375% Notes (or any
instrument that refinances the 0.375% Notes) or (y) the anticipated repayment date (November 2010) of the Initial CMBS Certificates (or any other refinancing of these instruments). However, we may request that each lender, in its sole
discretion, extend the termination date of the facility for one additional year. The proceeds available under the facility may only be used for the construction or acquisition of towers and for ground lease buyouts.

The Senior Credit Agreement requires SBA Senior Finance and SBA to maintain specific financial ratios, including, at the SBA Senior Finance level, a
Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) that does not exceed 6.9x for any fiscal quarter and an Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense ratio (as defined in the
Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0x for any fiscal quarter. In addition, SBA’s ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for any fiscal quarter cannot exceed
9.9x. The Senior Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit SBA Senior Finance’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale
leaseback transactions or merge or consolidate, or engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As of December 31, 2008, we were in full compliance with the financial covenants contained in
this agreement.

Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to SBA or certain of our subsidiaries, the
revolving credit loans automatically terminate and all amounts due under the Senior Credit Agreement and other loan documents become immediately due and payable. If certain other events of default occur, including failure to pay the principal and
interest when due, a breach of our negative covenants, or failure to perform any other requirement in the Senior Credit Agreement, the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (as described below) and/or certain other debt instruments, including the CMBS
Certificates, then with the permission of a majority of the lenders, the revolving credit commitments will terminate and all amounts due under the Senior Credit Agreement and other loan documents become immediately due and payable.

In connection with the senior secured revolving credit facility, we entered into a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, pursuant to which SBA,
Telecommunications and substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of SBA Senior Finance which are not Borrowers under the CMBS Certificates guarantee amounts owed under the senior secured revolving credit facility. Amounts borrowed under the
senior secured revolving credit facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of SBA Senior Finance’s assets not previously pledged under the CMBS Certificates and substantially all of the assets, other than leasehold, easement or
fee interest in real property, of the guarantors, including SBA and Telecommunications.

On July 18, 2008, SBA Senior Finance entered
into the First Amendment to the senior secured revolving credit facility to effect the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 18, 2008, among us, Optasite, and the other parties thereto, which was effective upon the acquisition
of Optasite. The First Amendment (i) deletes from the definition of Annualized Borrower EBITDA, any EBITDA generated by Optasite and its subsidiaries to the extent that such entities are not guarantors under the Guarantee and Collateral
Agreement, and, to the extent not permitted under the Optasite Credit Facility, (ii) excludes Optasite and its subsidiaries from an obligation to become guarantors under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement and (iii) permits us to not
pledge any stock or rights that we own in Optasite or any of its subsidiaries as collateral under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $230.6 million outstanding under this facility and had approximately $0.1 million of letters of credit posted against the availability of the credit facility outstanding. In addition, as of
December 31, 2008, availability under the credit facility was approximately $54.4 million.



Optasite Credit Facility

On September 16, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Optasite, we assumed Optasite’s fully drawn $150 million senior credit facility. At the time of the acquisition, the Optasite Credit Facility
consisted of a fully drawn $150 million loan which is secured by all of the property and interest in property of Optasite Towers, LLC (subsequently renamed SBA Infrastructure, Inc. (“Infrastructure”)). Interest on the Optasite Credit
Facility accrues at one month Eurodollar Rate plus 165 basis points and interest payments are due monthly. Commencing November 1, 2008, we began paying an amount equal to the monthly percentage share of the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Optasite Credit Facility based on a twenty-five year amortization and the facility cannot be re-drawn. The Optasite Credit Facility matures on November 1, 2010, when the remaining principal will be due in full.

The Optasite Credit Facility agreement requires Infrastructure to maintain specific financial ratios, including that Infrastructure’s consolidated
debt to Aggregate Tower Cash Flow (as defined in the Optasite Credit Facility agreement) be less than 7.0x, that its Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Optasite Credit Facility agreement) be more than 1.5x, and that the aggregate amount
of Annualized Rents generated from Tenant Leases in respect of rooftop towers does not exceed 5% of Aggregate Annualized Rent. The Optasite Credit Facility agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other
things, limit Infrastructure’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant certain liens, assume certain guarantee obligations, enter into certain mergers or consolidations, including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets, or
engage in certain asset dispositions. As of December 31, 2008, we were in full compliance with the financial covenants and the terms of the credit agreement.

Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to Infrastructure or SBA or any of SBA’s subsidiaries, all amounts due under the Optasite Credit Facility agreement become immediately
due and payable. If certain other events of default occur, such as the failure to pay any principal of any loan when due, or are continuing, such as failure to pay interest on any loan when due, failure to comply with the financial ratios, a change
of control of SBA or failure to perform under any other Infrastructure loan document, all amounts due under the Optasite Credit Facility agreement may be immediately due and payable.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $149.0 million outstanding under the Optasite Credit Facility, which was recorded at its accreted carrying value of
$146.4 million.

Inflation

The impact
of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. However, we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing
revenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2008, Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Emerging
Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 07-5, “

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock

” (“EITF 07-5”). EITF 07-5 supercedes EITF Issue No. 01-6,
“

The Meaning of Indexed to a Company’s Own Stock

” and addresses the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock. EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years and management does not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2008, FASB issued EITF Issue 08-4, “

Transition Guidance for Conforming Changes to Issue No. 98-5

(“EITF 08-4”)”.
The objective of EITF No.08-4 is to provide transition guidance for conforming changes made



to EITF No. 98-5, “

Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion
Ratios

”, that result from EITF 00-27 “

Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments

”, and SFAS No. 150, “

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity

”. This Issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Early application is permitted. EITF 08-4 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

“The Hierarchy of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles”

(“SFAS 162”). The statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are
prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles. Unlike Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 69,

“The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With GAAP,”

SFAS 162 is directed to the entity
rather than the auditor. The statement is effective November 15, 2008 and did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) 14-1, “

Accounting for Convertible
Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)

(“FSP APB 14-1”)

.

” FSP APB 14-1 requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash
(including partial cash settlement) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. FSP APB
14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. Upon adoption, FSP APB 14-1 requires companies to retrospectively apply the requirements of the
pronouncements to all periods presented. SBA’s 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2010 and 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 will be subject to FSP APB 14-1. Consequently, we are currently evaluating the impact of FSP APB 14-1 on our
consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We will be required to reduce the carrying value of our convertible debt and accrete the reduced value back to its full principal balance over
the term of the Notes. We will record this accretion as non-cash interest expense related to its outstanding convertible debt instruments.

In April 2008, FASB issued FSP FAS No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”

(FSP FAS 142-3”). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or
extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

.” FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 will have on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2008, FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment to FASB
Statement No. 133

” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 establishes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133. SFAS 161 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS 141(R)”) which
requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition-date fair values and changes other practices under SFAS No. 141 “

Business
Combinations”

, some of which could have a material impact on how we account for business combinations. These changes include, among other things, expensing acquisition costs as incurred as a component of operating expense. We presently
capitalize these acquisition costs as part of the purchase price and then amortize these costs using the straight line method over the life of the associated acquired assets. SFAS 141(R) also requires additional disclosure of information surrounding
a business combination, such that users of the entity’s financial statements can fully understand the nature and financial impact of a business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 141 (R) will have on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements”

(“SFAS 160”) which requires entities to report non-controlling (minority) interest in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

(“SFAS
159”)

,

which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at their fair values. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in
reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 became effective for us on January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material
impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS 157”) which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007. However, in February 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-1 and FSP SFAS No. 157-2. FSP SFAS No. 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13 “

Accounting for Leases

” and
other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under SFAS No. 13. FSP SFAS No. 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). This FSP partially defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2008, or in fiscal 2009 for us, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3 which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in an inactive market
by providing an illustrative example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for the financial asset is inactive. Effective January 1, 2008, the guidelines of SFAS 157 were applied in recording our
investments at their fair market value, which is further discussed in Note 4. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Commitments and Contractual Obligations

The
following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands):

(1)

Represents interest payments based on the CMBS Certificates with a weighted average coupon fixed interest rate of 5.9% and 6.0%, the Convertible Senior Notes interest rate of 0.375%
and 1.875%, the senior revolving credit facility interest rates ranging from 2.47% to 3.44% and the Optasite credit facility interest rate of 2.85%



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business.

The following table presents the future principal payment obligations and fair value associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual
level of long-term indebtedness as of December 31, 2008:

(1)

The anticipated repayment date is November 2010 for the Initial
CMBS Certificates and November 2011 for the Additional CMBS Certificates.

Our current primary market risk exposure is
interest rate risk relating to (1) the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to refinance the CMBS Certificates on their expected repayment dates or at maturity at market rates, (2) our ability to meet financial covenants and
(3) the interest rate associated with our floating rate loans that are outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the Optasite Credit Facility. We manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our use of
fixed rate debt. While we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis.

•

the continued use of towers and dependence on outsourced site development services by the wireless communications industry; and

•

our ability to successfully estimate certain accounting and tax matters, including the effect on our company of adopting certain accounting pronouncements and the
availability of sufficient net operating losses to offset taxable income.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This report contains certain non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Operating Profit information. We have provided below a description
of such non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures, their respective limitations and how management compensates for such
limitations.

Adjusted EBITDA

We
define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding the impact of net interest expenses (including amortization of deferred financing fees), provision for taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset impairment and other charges, non-cash
compensation, loss from write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses (including in 2008 the $13.3 million other-than-temporary



impairment charge on our auction rate securities), non-recurring acquisition related integration costs associated with the Optasite and Light Tower
acquisitions, non-cash leasing revenue and non-cash ground lease expense. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition related costs which are currently capitalized but, commencing January 1, 2009, is required to be expensed and included
within operating expenses pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 141(R). We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating
results. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The non-GAAP measurement of Adjusted EBITDA has certain material limitations, including:

•

it does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and
ability to generate profits and cash flows. Therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations,

•

it does not include depreciation, accretion and amortization expense. Because we use capital assets, depreciation, accretion and amortization expense is a necessary
element of our costs and ability to generate profits. Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation, accretion and amortization expense has material limitations,

•

it does not include provision for taxes. Because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our costs, particularly in the future, any measure that excludes tax
expense has material limitations, and

•

it does not include non-cash expenses such as asset impairment and other charges, non-cash compensation, other expenses/income, non-cash leasing revenue and
non-cash ground lease expense. Because these non-cash items are a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate profits, any measure that excludes these non-cash items has material limitations.

We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the
evaluation of our profitability and operating results.

The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

(1)

Includes $1,334, $1,125, and $858 of franchise taxes reflected on the Statement of Operations in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.



Segment Operating Profit

Each respective Segment Operating Profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues (excluding depreciation, accretion and amortization). Total Segment Operating Profit is the total of the operating
profits of the three segments. Segment Operating Profit is, in our opinion, an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating
results and margin of each segment, while excluding the impact of depreciation, accretion and amortization, which is largely fixed. Segment Operating Profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as
determined in accordance with GAAP.

The non-GAAP measurement of Segment Operating Profit has certain material limitations. Specifically
this measurement does not include depreciation, accretion and amortization expense. As we use capital assets in our business, depreciation, accretion and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profit.
Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation, accretion and amortization expense has material limitations. We compensate for these limitations by using Segment Operating Profit as only one of several comparative tools, together with GAAP
measurements, to assist in the evaluation of the operating performance of our segments.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

- We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief
Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures.

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2008, an
evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on
such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting -

Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of SBA;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of SBA are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of SBA; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of SBA's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of SBA’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 based upon criteria in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management
determined that SBA’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008 based on the criteria in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on SBA’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Certified Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries

We have audited SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, SBA
Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of SBA
Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008
of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 26, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of SBA Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), SBA Communications Corporation
and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

carriers and the construction and repair of transmission towers. Site development consulting services include (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support
in buying or leasing of the location; and (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits. Site construction services of the Company’s site development business provides a number of services, including, but not limited to the
following: (1) tower and related site construction; (2) antenna installation; and (3) radio equipment installation, commissioning and maintenance.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as follows:

a.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

b.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. The significant estimates made by management relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the costs and revenue relating to the Company’s construction contracts, stock-based compensation, valuation allowance related to
deferred tax assets, fair value of long-lived assets, the useful lives of towers and intangible assets, anticipated property tax assessments, fair value of investments and asset retirement obligations. Management develops estimates based on
historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available. These estimates ultimately may differ from actual results and such differences could be material.

c.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash in banks, money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. These
investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

d.

Investments

Investment securities with original maturities of more than three months but less than one year at time of purchase are considered short-term investments.
Investment securities with maturities of more than a year are considered long-term investments. Long-term investments at December 31, 2008 consist of auction rate securities which the Company believes that it will not be able to liquidate
within the next twelve months due to insufficient demand in the marketplace and as such are classified in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value (See Note 4). Fair value is determined in accordance with the
framework established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 157

“Fair Value Measurements”

which uses quoted market prices for those securities when available. When quoted market prices are not
available, the Company has

F-8


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

estimated fair value based upon the best available market information at the Balance Sheet date. Temporary unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded,
net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company follows the guidance in
Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,”

when determining whether impairment is other than
temporary. The Company reviews several factors to determine whether a loss is other-than-temporary. These factors include but are not limited to: (1) the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position, (2) the extent to which
fair value is less than cost, (3) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and (4) the Company’s ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.

e.

Restricted Cash

The Company classifies all cash pledged as collateral to secure certain obligations and all cash whose use is limited as restricted cash. This includes cash held in escrow to fund certain reserve accounts relating to
the CMBS Certificates, for payment and performance bonds, and surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company in the ordinary course of business.

In connection with the issuance of the CMBS Certificates (as defined in Note 12), the Company is
required to fund a restricted cash amount, which represents the cash held in escrow pursuant to the mortgage loan agreement governing the CMBS Certificates. This restricted cash amount is used to fund certain reserve accounts for the payment of debt
service costs, ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums related to tower sites, trustee and service expenses, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants. Pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan
agreement, all rents and other sums due on the towers that secure the CMBS Certificates are directly deposited into a controlled deposit account by the lessees and are held by the indenture trustee. The restricted cash held by the indenture trustee
in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 12) on or before the 15

th

calendar day
following month end providing that the Company is in compliance with its debt service coverage ratio and that no Event of Default has occurred. All monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash in
current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

f.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost or at estimated fair value (in case of acquired properties), adjusted for asset impairment and
estimated asset retirement obligations. Costs associated with the acquisition, development and construction of towers are capitalized as a cost of the towers. Costs for self-constructed towers include direct materials and labor, indirect costs and
capitalized interest. Approximately $0.2 million of interest cost was capitalized in both 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Depreciation on
towers and related components is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, not to exceed the minimum lease term of the underlying ground lease. The Company defines the minimum lease term as the shorter of the period
from lease inception through the end of the term of all tenant lease obligations in existence at ground lease inception, including renewal periods, or the ground lease term, including renewal periods. If no tenant lease obligation exists at the date
of ground lease inception, the initial term of the ground lease is considered the minimum lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the minimum lease term of
the lease. All rental obligations due to be paid out over the minimum lease term, including fixed escalations, are straight-lined evenly over the minimum lease term. For all other property and equipment, depreciation is provided using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.

F-9


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company performs ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment
for depreciation purposes. The estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset. If the useful lives of assets are reduced, depreciation may be
accelerated in future years. Property and equipment under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or the remaining estimated life of the leased property, whichever is shorter, and the related amortization is
included in depreciation expense. Expenditures for maintenance and repair are expensed as incurred.

Asset classes and related estimated
useful lives are as follows:

Towers and related components

3 - 15 years

Furniture, equipment and vehicles

2 - 7 years

Buildings and improvements

5 -10 years

Betterments, improvements and extraordinary repairs, which increase the value or extend the life
of an asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset. Changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively, with the book value of the asset at the time of the
change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life. There has been no material impact for changes in estimated useful lives for any years presented.

g.

Deferred Financing Fees

Financing fees related to the issuance
of debt have been deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the expected length of related indebtedness.

h.

Deferred Lease Costs

The Company defers certain initial direct costs associated with
the origination of tenant leases and lease amendments and amortizes these costs over the initial lease term, generally five years, or over the lease term remaining if related to a lease amendment. Such deferred costs were approximately $3.8 million,
$3.6 million, and $2.8 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Amortization expense was $2.7 million, $2.5 million, and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in cost of site
leasing on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, unamortized deferred lease costs were $7.6 million and $6.6 million, respectively, and are included in other assets on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

i.

Intangible Assets

The Company classifies as intangible assets the fair value of current leases in place at the acquisition date of towers and related assets (referred to as
the “current contract intangibles”), and the fair value of future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the acquired towers (referred to as the “network location intangibles”). These intangibles are estimated to have an
economic useful life consistent with the economic useful life of the related tower assets, which is typically 15 years. For all intangible assets, amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as the benefit
associated with these intangible assets is anticipated to be derived evenly over the life of the asset.

j.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates individual long-lived assets, including the intangibles with
finite lives, and the tower sites, for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-

Lived Assets.

F-10


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company records an impairment charge when the Company believes an investment in towers or the intangible assets has been impaired, such that
future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site and related intangible. Estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not limited to, general
market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. In addition, the Company makes certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of
calculating the amount of an impairment charge. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 (See Note 16).

k.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments, which primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted
cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments. Long-term investments consist of auction rate securities that the Company believes it will not be able to liquidate within the
next twelve months. Due to insufficient demand in the marketplace for auction rate securities, the Company relies in part on the report of a third party valuation firm to value the auction rate securities. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of
fair value of the auction rate securities investment.

The following table reflects fair values as determined by quoted market prices and
carrying values of the Company’s debt instruments:

l.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease
agreements, which are generally five years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Site development projects in which the Company performs consulting services include contracts on a time
and materials basis or a fixed price basis. Time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered. For those site development contracts in which the Company performs work on a fixed price basis, site
development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. Upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, the Company recognizes the revenue related to that phase. Site
development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete.

Revenue from construction projects is recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best
available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates

F-11


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. The asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted
contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues
recognized. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.

Cost of site leasing revenue includes ground lease rent, property taxes, maintenance (exclusive of employee related costs) and other tower operating expenses. Liabilities recorded related to the straight lining of ground leases are
reflected in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of site development revenue includes the cost of materials, salaries and labor costs, including payroll taxes, subcontract labor, vehicle expense and other costs
directly and indirectly related to the projects. All costs related to site development projects are recognized as incurred.

The Company
performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers. The Company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues
identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those
customers. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectability is determined to be probable.

The following is a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006:

m.

Income Taxes

The Company had taxable losses during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, and as a result, net operating loss carry-forwards have been
generated. These net operating loss carry-forwards are fully reserved as management believes it is not “more-likely-than-not” that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to recognize the losses.

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation Number 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

,” (“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken in a tax return. The Company must determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the
technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. FIN No. 48
applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes”

(“SFAS No. 109”)

.

The interpretation does not relate to non income tax positions
accounted for under FASB Statement No. 5,

“Accounting for Contingencies”

(“SFAS No. 5”)

.

FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Any cumulative effect of
applying the provisions of FIN No. 48 was required to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of

F-12


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

retained earnings on January 1, 2007. Upon adopting the provisions of FIN No. 48 beginning in the first quarter of 2007, the Company determined
that no such adjustment to its opening balance was required. During 2007 and 2008, the Company did not identify any exposures under FIN No. 48 that required an adjustment. In the future, to the extent that the Company records unrecognized tax
exposures in accordance with FIN No. 48, any related interest and penalties will be recognized as interest expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.

n.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R “

Share-Based Payments

” (“SFAS 123R”) which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes the Company’s previous accounting methodology using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 “

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

” (“APB 25”). The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 96-18, “

Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services

.”

The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized during the
year ended December 31, 2006 included: (a) compensation expense for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all share-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the
modified prospective transition method, the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS 123R.

On November 10, 2005, FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 123R-3, “

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

.” The Company has elected to adopt
the alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance
of the additional paid-in capital pool (“APIC Pool”) related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC Pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of
employee and director share-based awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123R.

o.

Asset Retirement
Obligations

In accordance with SFAS 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”

(“SFAS
143”)

,

the Company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and accretes such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement
date. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets, and over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the
estimated useful life of the tower.

The Company has entered into ground leases for the land underlying the majority of the Company’s
towers. A majority of these leases require the Company to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of the ground lease. SFAS 143 requires that the net present value of future restoration obligations be recorded as a liability
as of the date the legal obligation arises and this amount be capitalized to the related operating asset. The asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was $4.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, and is
included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

F-13


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Upon settlement of the obligations, any difference between the cost to retire an asset and the recorded liability is recorded in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations as a gain or loss. In determining the impact of SFAS 143, the Company considered the nature and scope of the contractual restoration obligations contained in the Company’s third party ground leases, the historical retirement
experience as an indicator of future restoration probabilities, intent in renewing existing ground leases through lease termination dates, current and future value and timing of estimated restoration costs and the credit adjusted risk-free rate used
to discount future obligations.

The following summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation liability:

p.

Loss Per Share

Basic and diluted loss per share is calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “

Earnings per Share”.

The Company has potential
common stock equivalents related to its outstanding stock options and Convertible Notes. These potential common stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive in calculating the full
year earnings per share. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share and the weighted average number of shares used in the computations are the same for all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

q.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, and is comprised of net
income (loss) and “other comprehensive income (loss).” Comprehensive loss is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity.

3. CURRENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2008, FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 07-5, “

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock

” (“EITF 07-5”). EITF 07-5 supercedes EITF Issue No. 01-6, “

The Meaning of Indexed to a
Company’s Own Stock

” and addresses the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock. EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Management does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2008, FASB issued EITF Issue 08-4, “

Transition Guidance for Conforming Changes to EITF Issue No. 98-5”

(“EITF
08-4”). The objective of EITF No. 08-4 is to provide transition guidance for conforming changes made to EITF No. 98-5, “

Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable
Conversion Ratios

”, that result from EITF 00-27 “

Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments

”, and SFAS No. 150, “

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with

F-14


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

”. This Issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2008. Early application is permitted. EITF 08-4 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

“The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”

(“SFAS
162”). The statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are prepared in conformance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Unlike Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 69,

“The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,”

SFAS 162 is directed to the entity rather than
the auditor. The statement became effective on November 15, 2008 and did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) 14-1, “

Accounting for Convertible
Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)

(“FSP APB 14-1”)

.

” FSP APB 14-1 requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash
(including partial cash settlement) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. FSP APB
14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. Upon adoption, FSP APB 14-1 requires companies to retrospectively apply the requirements of the
pronouncements to all periods presented. The Company’s 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2010 and 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 will be subject to FSP APB 14-1. Consequently, the Company is currently evaluating the impact of FSP
APB 14-1 on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and prior period. The Company will be required to reduce the carrying value of its convertible debt and accrete the reduced
carrying value back to its full principal balance over the term of the Notes. The Company will record this accretion as non-cash interest expense related to its outstanding convertible debt instruments on the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations.

In April 2008, FASB issued FSP FAS No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”

(FSP FAS 142-3”). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FSP
FAS 142-3 will have on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2008,
FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 133

” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 establishes the disclosure requirements for derivative
instruments and hedging activities and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133. SFAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company does not
expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS 141(R)”) which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition-date fair values and changes other practices under SFAS No. 141 “

Business Combinations,”

some of which could have a material impact on how the Company accounts for business
combinations. These changes include, among other things, expensing acquisition costs as incurred as a component of operating expense. The Company presently capitalizes these acquisition costs as part of the purchase price and then amortizes these
costs using the straight line method over the life of the associated acquired assets. SFAS 141(R) also requires additional disclosure of information surrounding a business

F-15


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

combination, such that users of the entity’s financial statements can fully understand the nature and financial impact of a business combination. SFAS
141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 141(R) will have on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”

(“SFAS 160”) which requires entities to report non-controlling (minority) interest in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

(“SFAS 159”)

,

which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at their fair values. The objective is to improve financial reporting by
providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 became effective for the Company
on January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS 157”) which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, in February 2008, FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-1 and FSP SFAS No. 157-2. FSP SFAS No. 157-1 amends
SFAS 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13 “

Accounting for Leases

” and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under SFAS No. 13. FSP SFAS
No. 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually).
This FSP partially defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, or in fiscal 2009 for the Company, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. In October
2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3 which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in an inactive market by providing an illustrative example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for the financial asset
is inactive. Effective January 1, 2008, the guidelines of SFAS 157 were applied in recording the Company’s investments at their fair market value, which is further discussed in Note 4. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

4. INVESTMENTS

Auction rate securities are debt instruments with long-term scheduled maturities that have interest rates that are typically reset at pre-determined
intervals, usually every 7, 28, 35 or 90 days, at which time the securities would historically be purchased or sold, creating a liquid market. Historically, an active secondary market existed for such investments and the rate reset for each
instrument was an opportunity to roll over the holdings or obtain immediate liquidity by selling the securities at par. However, in the third quarter of 2008, due to insufficient demand in the marketplace driven by the state of the credit markets,
the Company no longer believed it would be able to liquidate the remaining auction rate securities within a twelve month period and thus reclassified the auction rate securities to long-term investments. As of December 31, 2008, the Company
held investments in three securities with a par value of $29.8 million and a fair value of $1.0 million which are included in other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

These securities were issued by trusts which held investments in investment-grade commercial paper. Two of these trusts were a party to put agreements
with Ambac Assurance Corporation (“Ambac”), and the third trust was

F-16


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

a party to a put agreement with Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (“FGIC”). These put agreements provided Ambac or FGIC, respectively, the right
to compel the trust to purchase either Ambac or FGIC preferred stock by liquidating the investments held by the trust.

In October 2008,
FGIC exercised their put right (associated with $9.8 million of par value auction rate securities held by the Company) resulting in the issuing trust purchasing and holding FGIC Series C Perpetual Preferred Stock (“FGIC Preferred Stock”).
If FGIC fails to pay dividends on the FGIC Preferred Stock, the trust must liquidate and dissolve, and 98 shares of FGIC Preferred Stock must be distributed to the Company. On November 19, 2008, the Company was notified by the trustee that FGIC
does not have sufficient funds legally available to make dividend payments on the FGIC Preferred Stock. As such, the Company expects the trust to be liquidated and dissolved, and expects shares of FGIC Preferred Stock to be distributed to the
Company. As of December 31, 2008 the trust had not been liquidated.

In December 2008, Ambac exercised its put rights (associated with
$20.0 million of par value auction rate securities held by the Company) resulting in the issuing trusts purchasing Ambac Auction Market Preferred Shares (“Ambac Preferred Stock”). In January 2009, pursuant to the exercise of the put right,
the Ambac Preferred Stock was issued to the trust, which then distributed the shares of Ambac Preferred Stock to the security holders and liquidated. The Company received 800 shares of Ambac Preferred Stock.

The Company held auction rate securities with a par value of $70.7 million as of December 31, 2007. Gross purchases and sales of these investments
are presented within “Cash flows from investing activities” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2007, the Company classified the auction rate securities as short-term based on its intent to
continue to liquidate these investments within a twelve month period.

SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value. Traditionally, the fair value of auction rate securities approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction rate process. However, as a result of
insufficient demand in the marketplace, the auction rate process has resulted in numerous “failed auctions” over the past twelve months and the Company, like other holders of auction rate securities, has not been able to liquidate the
three remaining auction rate securities held in the Company’s portfolio. Consequently, the Company has estimated the fair value of these auction rate securities based on values provided by a third party valuation firm utilizing a Level 3
valuation methodology. SFAS 157 defines Level 3 valuations as those which rely on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Management validated
the assumptions used in the valuation including the ultimate time horizon over which dividends are anticipated to be paid on the preferred stock, the coupon rate for these securities, and the appropriate discount margins. The Company continues to
monitor market and other conditions in assessing whether further changes in the fair value of these securities are warranted. Due to the lack of a market for Ambac Preferred Stock and FGIC Preferred Stock, the established fair value of these
securities is a matter of judgment. These estimated fair values could change based on future market conditions and as such, the Company may be required to record additional unrealized losses for impairment if the Company determines there are further
declines in their fair value.

F-17


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following table presents the Company’s auction rate securities measured at fair value:

The Company recorded $13.3 million and $15.6 million of other–than–temporary impairment
charges in other income (expense) on its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company determined the other-than-temporary impairment charges based on a variety of factors,
including the significant decline in fair value indicated for the individual investments, the adverse market conditions impacting auction rate securities and the exercise of the put rights that resulted in the Company indirectly owning shares of
FGIC Preferred Stock and directly owning shares of Ambac Preferred Stock.

5. RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash consists of the following:

In connection with the issuance of the CMBS
Certificates (as defined in Note 12), the Company is required to fund a restricted cash amount, which represents the cash held in escrow pursuant to the mortgage loan agreement governing the CMBS Certificates. This restricted cash amount is used to
fund certain reserve accounts for the payment of debt service costs, ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums related to tower sites, and trustee and servicing expenses, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from
tenants. Pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan agreement, all rents and other sums due on the towers that secure the CMBS Certificates are directly deposited into a controlled deposit account by the lessees and are held by the indenture
trustee. The restricted cash held by the indenture trustee in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 12) on or before the 15

th

calendar day following month end provided that the Company is in compliance with its debt service coverage ratio and that no Event of Default has occurred. All monies held by the
indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Payment and
performance bonds relate primarily to collateral requirements relating to tower construction currently in process by the Company. Cash is pledged as collateral related to surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company or its affiliates in the
ordinary course of business and primarily related to the Company’s tower removal obligations. In addition, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had pledged $2.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, as collateral related to its
workers compensation policy. These amounts are included in other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of December
31, 2008, the Company had $1.3 million in removal bonds for which it is not required to post collateral.

6. ACQUISITIONS

On September 16, 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company merged with Optasite Holding Company Inc. (“Optasite”) and Optasite became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As of the closing,
Optasite owned 528 tower sites, located in 31 states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and had approximately 38 managed site locations. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company issued 7.25 million shares of SBA
Class A common stock to the Optasite securityholders, assumed Optasite’s fully-drawn $150 million senior credit facility (see Note 12) and assumed approximately $26.9 million of additional liabilities. The aggregate consideration paid for
Optasite was approximately $433.3 million. The results of operations of Optasite are included with those of the Company from the date of the acquisition.

On October 20, 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired Light Tower Wireless, LLC (“Light Tower”), the wireless infrastructure subsidiary of Light Tower LLC. Light Tower became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As of the closing, Light Tower owned 340 wireless communications towers, five managed sites and five distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks. The aggregate purchase price paid for these towers
and related assets was approximately $224.0 million which was paid in cash. The results of operations of Light Tower are included with those of the Company from the date of the acquisition.

In addition to the Optasite and Light Tower acquisitions, during 2008, the Company acquired 587 completed towers (including 423 towers from the TowerCo
LLC acquisition) and related assets and liabilities from various sellers as well as the equity interest of six entities, whose holdings consisted of 114 towers and related assets and liabilities. The aggregate consideration paid for these towers and
related assets was $479.6 million, consisting of $441.1 million in cash (excluding $9.2 million of working capital adjustments, due diligence and other acquisition related costs) and approximately 1.2 million shares of Class A common stock
valued at $38.6 million (excluding $0.7 million of negative working capital adjustments). The Company accounted for all of the above tower acquisitions at fair market value at the date of each acquisition. The results of operations of the acquired
assets are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. These acquisitions were not significant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accordingly, pro forma financial information has not
been presented. Also, during 2008, the Company paid in cash $19.9 million for land and easement purchases in addition to $3.3 million spent for long-term lease extensions related to the land underneath the Company’s towers.

During 2007, the Company acquired 529 completed towers, related assets and liabilities from various sellers as well as the equity interest of three
entities, whose assets consisted of approximately 83 towers and related assets and liabilities. The aggregate net consideration paid for these additional assets was $330.0 million, consisting of $166.3 million in cash (excluding $3.2 million of cash
payments for working capital adjustments, and due diligence and other acquisition related costs) and approximately 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock valued at $163.7 million (excluding an offset of $8.2 million associated with
negative working capital adjustments). The Company accounted for all of the above tower acquisitions at fair market value at the date of each acquisition. The results of operations of the acquired assets are included with those of the Company from
the dates of their respective acquisitions. None of the individual acquisitions or aggregate acquisitions consummated was significant to the Company’s consolidated financials statements and accordingly, pro forma financial information has not
been presented. Also, during 2007, the Company paid in cash $23.4 million for land and easement purchases in addition to $10.9 million spent for long-term lease extensions related to the land underneath the Company’s towers.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

, the Company continues to evaluate all acquisitions within one year
after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether

F-19


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet
caption, as well as the separate recognition of intangible assets from goodwill if certain criteria are met. These intangible assets represent the value associated with current leases in place (“Current Contract Intangibles”) at the
acquisition date and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the acquired towers (“Network Location Intangible”) and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows. The intangible assets
are estimated to have an economic useful life consistent with the economic useful life of the related tower assets, which is typically 15 years.

From time to time, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration for such acquisitions if the towers or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets in the 1-3 years after they have been acquired. As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had an obligation to pay up to an additional $9.4 million in consideration if the performance targets contained in various acquisition agreements are met. These obligations are associated with new build and tower
acquisition programs within the Company’s site leasing segment. In certain acquisitions, the additional consideration may be paid in cash or shares of Class A common stock at the Company’s option. The Company records such obligations
as additional consideration when it becomes probable that the targets will be met.

For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
certain earnings targets associated with the acquired towers were achieved, and therefore, the Company paid in cash $3.5 million and $5.5 million, respectively. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company issued approximately
67,000 shares of Class A common stock in settlement of contingent price amounts payable as a result of acquired towers exceeding certain performance targets. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company did not issue any shares of
Class A Common stock in settlement of contingent price amounts.

7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET

The following table provides the gross and net carrying amounts for each major class of intangible assets:

All intangibles noted above are contained in the Company’s site leasing segment. The Company
amortizes its intangibles using the straight line method over fifteen years. Amortization expense relating to the intangible assets above was $77.5 million, $54.3 million and $33.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. These amounts are subject to changes in estimates until the preliminary allocation of the purchase price is finalized for each acquisition.

10. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The
Company’s credit risks consist primarily of accounts receivable with national, regional and local wireless service providers and federal and state government agencies. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’
financial condition and provides allowances for doubtful accounts, as required, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. The Company generally does not require collateral. The

The CMBS Certificates

Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-1

On November 18, 2005, SBA CMBS-1 Depositor LLC (the
“Depositor”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, sold in a private transaction, $405.0 million of Initial CMBS Certificates, Series 2005-1 (the “Initial CMBS Certificates”) issued by SBA CMBS Trust (the “Trust”), a
trust established by the Depositor (the “Initial CMBS Transaction”).

The Initial CMBS Certificates consist of five classes, all
of which are rated investment grade with a principal balance and annual pass-through interest rate, as indicated in the table below:

The weighted average annual fixed coupon interest rate of the Initial CMBS Certificates as of
December 31, 2008 is 5.6%, payable monthly, and the effective weighted average fixed interest rate is 4.8%, after giving effect to the settlement of two interest rate swap agreements entered into in contemplation of the transaction (see Note
13). The Initial CMBS Certificates have an anticipated repayment date in November 2010 with a final repayment date in 2035. The Company incurred deferred financing fees of $12.2 million associated with the closing of this transaction.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company repurchased, for cash, $6.2 million in principal amount of Initial CMBS Certificates subclass 1D in
privately negotiated transactions. In accordance with APB 26 “

Early Extinguishment of Debt

December 31, 2008 is 6.0%, payable monthly, and the effective weighted average fixed interest rate is 6.3% after giving effect to the settlement of the nine interest rate swap agreements entered into in contemplation of the transaction (see
Note 13). The Additional CMBS Certificates have an anticipated repayment date in November 2011 with a final repayment date in 2036. The Company incurred deferred financing fees of $24.1 million associated with the closing of this transaction.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company repurchased, for cash, $59.3 million in principal amount of Additional CMBS Certificates in
privately negotiated transactions. In accordance with APB 26 “Early Extinguishment of Debt,” the Company recorded an $18.6 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt net of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees in its
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The assets of the Trust, which issued both the Initial CMBS Certificates and the Additional CMBS
Certificates, consist of a non-recourse mortgage loan initially made in favor of SBA Properties as the initial borrower. In connection with the issuance of the Additional CMBS Certificates, each of SBA Sites, Inc., SBA Structures, Inc., SBA Towers,
Inc., SBA Puerto Rico, Inc. and SBA Towers USVI, Inc. (the “Additional Borrowers” and collectively with SBA Properties, Inc., the “Borrowers”) were added as additional borrowers under the mortgage loan and the principal amount of
the mortgage loan was increased by $1.15 billion to an aggregate of $1.56 billion. The mortgage loan consists of multiple tranches, or components, each of which has terms that are identical to the subclass of CMBS Certificates to which it relates.
The Borrowers are special purpose vehicles which exist solely to hold the towers which are subject to the securitization. The Borrowers are jointly and severally liable under the mortgage loan.

The mortgage loan is to be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 4,969 towers owned by the Borrowers (the “CMBS Towers”).
Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made in relation to the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the Initial CMBS Certificates prior to the monthly payment date in
November 2010, which is the anticipated repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the Initial CMBS Certificates, and no payments of principal will be required to be made in relation to the components of the mortgage
loan corresponding to the Additional CMBS Certificates prior to the monthly payment date in November 2011, which is the anticipated repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the Additional CMBS Certificates.

The Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part at any time prior to November 2010 for
the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the Initial CMBS Certificates and November 2011 for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the Additional CMBS Certificates upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration.
The prepayment consideration is determined per class and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the
date of prepayment to and including the first due date that is nine months prior to the anticipated repayment date, assuming the entire unpaid principal amount of such class is required to be paid, over (2) that portion of the principal balance
of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment. If the prepayment occurs (i) within nine months of the anticipated repayment date, (ii) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of the Borrowers’ sites
or (iii) during an amortization period, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan components corresponding to the Initial CMBS Certificates will be due in November 2035 and those corresponding
to the Additional CMBS Certificates will be due in November 2036. However, to the extent that the full amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the Initial CMBS Certificates or the amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to
the Additional CMBS Certificates are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each component would increase by the greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the
ten-year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component. In addition, if the 2005 CMBS Certificates
are not fully repaid by November 2010, then excess cash flow (as defined below) will be trapped by the Trustee and applied first to repay the original cash coupons on the CMBS Certificates, to fund all reserve accounts, fund operating expenses
associated with the towers, pay the management fees and then to repay principal of the 2005 and the 2006 CMBS Certificates in order of their investment grade (i.e. the 2005-1A and 2006-1A subclasses would have their respective principal repaid
equally prior to repayment of the other subclasses of the CMBS Certificates). The mortgage loan may be defeased in whole at any time prior to the anticipated repayment date.

The mortgage loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the CMBS tower sites and their
operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (3) the Borrowers’ rights under the management agreement they entered into with SBA Network Management, Inc.
(“SBA Network Management”), relating to the management of the Borrowers’ tower sites by SBA Network Management pursuant to which SBA Network Management arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the funding of all capital
expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on the Borrowers’ behalf, (4) the Borrowers’ rights under certain site management agreements, (5) the Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant
leases, (6) the pledge by SBA CMBS-1 Guarantor LLC and SBA CMBS-1 Holdings, LLC of equity interests of the initial borrower and SBA CMBS-1 Guarantor LLC, (7) the various deposit accounts and collection accounts of the Borrowers and
(8) all proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar month, SBA Network Management is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 7.5% of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.

In connection with the issuance of the CMBS Certificates, the Company established a deposit account into which all rents and other sums due on the CMBS
Towers are directly deposited by the lessees and are held by the indenture trustee. The funds in this deposit account are used to fund a restricted cash amount, which represents the cash held in escrow pursuant to the mortgage loan governing the
CMBS Certificates to fund certain reserve accounts for the payment of debt service costs, ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums related to tower sites, trustee and service expenses, and to reserve a portion of
advance rents from tenants on the 4,969 tower sites. The monies held by the indenture trustee in excess of required reserve balances are subsequently released to the Borrowers on or before the 15th calendar day following month end. The monies held
by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 5). However, if the debt service coverage ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the Mortgage
Loan Agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any

calendar quarter, falls to 1.30 times or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to
pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The
funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30 times for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15 times as of the end of any
calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a
calendar quarter. As of December 31, 2008, we met the required debt service coverage ratio as defined by the mortgage loan agreement.

0.375%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2010

On March 26, 2007, the Company issued $350.0 million of its 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes (the
“0.375% Notes”). Interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. The 0.375% Notes have a maturity date of December 1, 2010. The Company incurred deferred financing fees of $8.6 million with the issuance of the
0.375% Notes.

The 0.375% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock,
at an initial conversion rate of 29.7992 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 0.375% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $33.56 per share
or a 19% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $28.20 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 20, 2007, the purchase agreement date. The 0.375% Notes are convertible only under
the following certain circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing at any time after June 30, 2007 and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock for at
least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of Class A common stock on the last day of such
preceding calendar quarter, (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of a 0.375% Note for each day in the measurement period was less than 95% of the product of the last
reported sale price of Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate, (3) if specified distributions to holders of Class A common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur, and (4) at any time on or after
October 12, 2010.

Upon conversion, the Company has the right to settle the conversion of each $1,000 principal amount of 0.375% Notes
with any of the three following alternatives, at its option, delivery of (1) 29.7992 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, (2) cash equal to the value of 29.7992 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock
calculated at the market price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock at the time of conversion or (3) a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock.

The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $341.4 million after deducting discounts, commissions and expenses. A portion of the net proceeds
from the sale of the 0.375% Notes was used to repurchase approximately 3.24 million shares of Class A common stock, valued at approximately $91.2 million based on the closing stock price of $28.20 on March 20, 2007. These repurchased
shares were immediately retired by the Company. The repurchased shares were recorded as a reduction to Class A common stock for the par value of the Class A common stock as well as an increase to accumulated deficit on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Concurrently with the sale of the 0.375% Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions
with affiliates of two of the initial purchasers of the 0.375% Notes. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions is $33.56 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock (the same as the initial conversion price
of the 0.375% Notes) and is similarly subject to certain customary adjustments. The

convertible note hedge transactions cover 10,429,720 shares of Class A common stock. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $77.2
million. A portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 0.375% Notes and the warrants discussed below were used to pay for the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was recorded as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Separately and concurrently with entering into
the convertible note hedge transactions, the Company entered into warrant transactions whereby the Company sold warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire 10,429,720 shares of Class A common stock at an initial exercise price of
$55.00 per share. The aggregate proceeds from the issuance of the warrants were $27.3 million. The proceeds for the issuance of the warrants were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company consummated privately negotiated exchanges of stock for outstanding 0.375% Notes in
reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pursuant to these exchanges, the Company issued 3,407,914 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in exchange for $73.8 million in principal amount of 0.375%
Notes. In accordance with SFAS No. 84, “

Induced Conversion of Convertible Debt

” the Company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $19.5 million and an adjustment of $93.4 million to additional paid-in capital
related to these transactions. In addition, the Company also repurchased in privately negotiated transactions $138.1 million in principal amount of 0.375% Notes for $102.5 million in cash. In accordance with APB 26 “

Early Extinguishment of
Debt

,” the Company recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $35.6 million related to these transactions. The notes acquired represent 60.5% of the original $350 million principal amount of 0.375% Notes issued. The company has
written off unamortized deferred financing fees of $3.0 million in its Consolidated Statement of Operations.

1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013

On May 16, 2008, the Company issued $550.0 million of its 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “1.875% Notes”). Interest
is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1, beginning November 1, 2008. The 1.875% Notes have a maturity date of May 1, 2013. The Company incurred deferred financing fees of $12.9 million with the issuance of the 1.875%
Notes.

The 1.875% Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, at an
initial conversion rate of 24.1196 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes (subject to certain customary adjustments), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $41.46 per share or a
20% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $34.55 per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2008, the purchase agreement date. The 1.875% Notes are convertible only under the
following certain circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing at any time after June 30, 2008 and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock for at least
20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock on the last
trading day of such preceding calendar quarter, (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes for each day in the measurement period
was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate, (3) if specified distributions to holders of the Company’s Class A common stock are
made or specified corporate transactions occur, and (4) at any time on or after February 19, 2013.

Upon conversion, the Company
has the right to settle the conversion of each $1,000 principal amount of 1.875% Notes with any of the three following alternatives, at its option: delivery of (1) 24.1196 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, (2) cash
equal to the value of 24.1196 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock calculated at the market price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock at the time of conversion or (3) a combination of cash and shares of
the Company’s Class A common stock.

The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $536.8 million after deducting discounts,
commissions and expenses. A portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 1.875% Notes was used to repurchase and retire approximately 3.47 million shares of Class A common stock, valued at $120.0 million based on the closing stock
price of $34.55 on May 12, 2008. The repurchased shares were recorded as a reduction to Class A common stock for the par value of the Class A common stock as well as an increase to accumulated deficit on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concurrently with the pricing of the 1.875% Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge
transactions with affiliates of four of the initial purchasers of the 1.875% Notes. The initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions is $41.46 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock (the same as the initial
conversion price of the 1.875% Notes) and is similarly subject to certain customary adjustments. The convertible note hedge transactions originally covered 13,265,780 shares of Class A common stock. The cost of the convertible note hedge
transactions was $137.7 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the 1.875% Notes and the warrant transactions discussed below were used to pay for the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions. The cost of the convertible note
hedge transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Separately
and concurrently with entering into the convertible note hedge transactions, the Company entered into warrant transactions whereby the Company sold warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire an aggregate of 13,265,780 shares of
Class A common stock at an initial exercise price of $67.37 per share. The aggregate proceeds from the warrant transactions were $56.2 million. The proceeds from issuance of the warrants were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in
capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

One of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with
the 1.875% Notes was with Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (“Lehman Derivatives”). The convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives covers 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of Company Class A common stock potentially
issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes. In October 2008, Lehman Derivatives filed a motion for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The filing by Lehman Derivatives of a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition
constituted an “event of default” under the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. As a result, on November 7, 2008 the Company terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives. Based on
information available to the Company, there is no indication, as of the date of filing this Form 10-K, that any party other than Lehman Derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations under the convertible note hedge transactions.

The net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction with Lehman Derivatives was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital
and therefore the “event of default” did not have any impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. However, the Company could incur significant costs to replace this hedge transaction if it elects to do so. If
the Company does not elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction, then the Company would be subject to potential dilution or additional cost (depending on if the note is settled with shares or cash) upon conversion of the 1.875% Notes,
if on the date of conversion the per share market price of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeded the conversion price of $41.46.

Senior
Revolving Credit Facility

On December 21, 2005, SBA Senior Finance II LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, closed on a senior
revolving credit facility in the amount of $160.0 million. Amounts borrowed under this facility were secured by a first lien on substantially all of SBA Senior Finance II’s assets and were guaranteed by the Company and certain of its other
subsidiaries. This facility replaced the prior facility which was assigned and became the mortgage loan underlying the Initial CMBS Certificates issuance. The Company incurred deferred financing fees of $1.2 million associated with the closing of
this transaction.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 29, 2007, the Company provided the lenders with a termination notice with respect to
the senior revolving credit facility. In accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, the senior revolving credit facility terminated April 3, 2007. The Company had no borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility at the time of
its termination. No early termination penalties were incurred by the Company as a result of the termination. The Company recorded a $0.4 million loss from write-off of deferred financing fees in connection with the termination of the senior
revolving credit facility.

Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility

On January 18, 2008, SBA Senior Finance, Inc. (“SBASF”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $285.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with several banks and
other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the credit agreement (the “Lenders”): Wachovia Bank, National Association, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (“LCPI”), Citicorp North America, Inc., JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. and Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC (the “Senior Credit Agreement”). On March 5, 2008, SBASF entered into a new lender supplement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group in connection with the
senior secured revolving credit facility, which increased the aggregate commitment of the lenders to $335.0 million. In September 2008, the Company made a drawing request under the senior secured credit facility and LCPI, who was a lender under the
senior secured revolving credit facility, did not fund its share of such request. As a result of such failure to fund, SBA delivered a letter to LCPI declaring that LCPI was in default of its obligations under the senior secured revolving credit
facility agreement. In October 2008, LCPI filed a voluntary petition for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. LCPI, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. had committed $50.0 million of the original aggregate of
$335.0 million in commitments under the senior secured revolving credit facility. As a result, the aggregate commitment of the senior secured revolving credit facility is currently $285.0 million. No lender within the facility is committed to fund
more than $50.0 million.

The senior secured revolving credit facility may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with
the financial and other covenants in the Senior Credit Agreement. Amounts borrowed under the facility accrue interest at the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a Base Rate (as defined in the
Senior Credit Agreement) plus a margin that ranges from 50 basis points to 200 basis points, in each case based on the Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement and discussed below). A
0.5% per annum fee is charged on the amount of unused commitment. The facility will terminate and SBASF will repay all amounts outstanding on the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of January 18, 2008 and (ii) the date which is
three months prior to the (x) final maturity date of the 0.375% Notes (or any instrument that refinances the 0.375% Notes) or (y) the anticipated repayment date (November 9, 2010) of the Initial CMBS Certificates (or any other refinancing
of these instruments). At the termination date, each lender under the facility may, in its sole discretion and upon the request of SBASF, extend the maturity date of the facility for one additional year. The proceeds available under the facility may
only be used for the construction or acquisition of towers and for ground lease buyouts. The Company incurred deferred financing fees of $2.8 million associated with the closing of this transaction. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of LCPI, the
Company has written off unamortized deferred financing fees of $0.4 million in its Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The Senior Credit
Agreement requires SBASF and SBA Communications to maintain specific financial ratios, including, at the SBASF level, a Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) that does not exceed 6.9x
for any fiscal quarter and an Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0x for any fiscal quarter. In addition, the Company’s ratio of Consolidated Total
Net Debt to

F-31


SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for any fiscal quarter cannot exceed 9.9x. The Senior Credit Agreement also contains
customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit SBASF’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions or merge or consolidate, or engage in
certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As of December 31, 2008, SBASF was in full compliance with the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility.

Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to the Company or certain of our subsidiaries, the revolving credit loans
automatically terminate and all amounts due under the Senior Credit Agreement and other loan documents become immediately due and payable. If certain other events of default occur, including failure to pay the principal and interest when due, a
breach of the Company’s negative covenants, or failure to perform any other requirement in the Senior Credit Agreement, the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (as described below) and/or certain other debt instruments, including the Notes and
the CMBS Certificates, then, with the permission of a majority of the lenders, the revolving credit commitments will terminate and all amounts due under the Senior Credit Agreement and other loan documents become immediately due and payable.

In connection with the senior secured revolving credit facility, the Company entered into a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, pursuant
to which SBA Communications, Telecommunications and substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of SBASF which are not Borrowers under the CMBS Certificates, guarantee amounts owed under the senior secured revolving credit facility. Amounts
borrowed under the senior secured revolving credit facility will be secured by a first lien on substantially all of SBASF’s assets not previously pledged under the CMBS Certificates and substantially all of the assets, other than leasehold,
easement or fee interests in real property, of the guarantors, including SBA Communications and SBA Telecommunications.

On July 18,
2008, SBASF entered into the First Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement to effect the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger among the Company, Optasite and the other parties thereto, which was effective upon the acquisition of Optasite. The
First Amendment deletes from the definition of Annualized Borrower EBITDA, any EBITDA generated by Optasite and its subsidiaries to the extent that such entities are not guarantors under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, and, to the extent not
permitted under the Optasite Credit Facility, (i) excludes Optasite and its subsidiaries from an obligation to become guarantors under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement and (ii) permits the Company to not pledge any stock or rights
that it owns in Optasite or any of its subsidiaries as collateral under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement.

During 2008, SBASF
borrowed $465.6 million and repaid $235.0 million under this facility, which is presented within “Cash flows from financing activities” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company used or designated such
proceeds for construction and acquisition of towers (including those acquired from TowerCo LLC and Light Tower Wireless) and for ground lease buyouts. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $230.6 million outstanding under this facility and
had approximately $0.1 million of letters of credit posted against the availability of the facility outstanding. The weighted average effective interest rate for amounts borrowed under the senior secured revolving credit facility for the year ended
December 31, 2008 was 4.3%. As of December 31, 2008, availability under the senior secured revolving credit facility was approximately $54.4 million.

Optasite Credit Facility

On September 16, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Optasite, the Company assumed
Optasite’s fully drawn $150 million senior credit facility (the “Optasite Credit Facility”) ”) pursuant to a credit agreement by and among Optasite Towers LLC, (a subsidiary of Optasite) as borrower (“Optasite Towers”),
Morgan Stanley Asset Funding Inc. (“Morgan Stanley”), as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders (the “Lenders”) from time to time party thereto (the “Optasite Credit Facility Agreement”). The
Optasite Credit

Facility is secured by all of the property and interest in property of Optasite Towers. The Company recorded the Optasite Credit Facility at its fair value
of $147.0 million on the date of acquisition. Interest on the Optasite Credit Facility accrues at the one month Eurodollar Rate plus 165 basis points and interest payments are due monthly. Commencing November 1, 2008, the Company began paying
an amount equal to the monthly percentage share of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Optasite Credit Facility based on a twenty-five year amortization and the facility cannot be re-drawn. The Optasite Credit Facility matures on
November 1, 2010, when the remaining principal will be due in full. Principal outstanding under the Optasite Credit Facility may be partially prepaid at the option of Optasite Towers, and must be prepaid, in certain circumstances, from the
proceeds of new indebtedness, asset sales or insurance claims.

The Optasite Credit Facility Agreement requires Optasite Towers to maintain
specific financial ratios, including that Optasite Towers’ consolidated debt to Aggregate Tower Cash Flow (as defined in the Optasite Credit Facility Agreement) be less than 7.0x, that its Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Optasite
Credit Facility Agreement) be more than 1.5x, and that the aggregate amount of Annualized Rents generated from Tenant Leases in respect of rooftop towers does not exceed 5% of Aggregate Annualized Rent. The Optasite Credit Facility Agreement also
contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Optasite Tower’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant certain liens, assume certain guarantee obligations, enter into certain mergers or
consolidations, including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets, or engage in certain asset dispositions. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was in full compliance with the terms of the Optasite Credit Facility.

Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to Optasite Towers or the Company or any of the Company’s subsidiaries,
all amounts due under the Optasite Credit Facility become immediately due and payable. If certain other events of default occur, such as the failure to pay any principal of any loan when due, or are continuing, such as failure to pay interest on any
loan when due, failure to comply with the financial ratios, a change of control of the Company or failure to perform under any other Optasite loan document, all amounts due under the Optasite Credit Facility may be immediately due and payable.

In connection with its assumption of the Optasite Credit Facility, the Company entered into Guarantee Agreements dated as of July 18,
2008 by and among the Company and Morgan Stanley pursuant to which the Company guaranteed Optasite Towers’ obligations under the Optasite Credit Facility, including but not limited to, principal and interest owed under the Optasite Credit
Facility, as well as the lenders’ actual losses arising out of (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation of Optasite Towers, (ii) intentional actions by Optasite Towers, (iii) failure of Optasite Towers to comply with
environmental laws or (iv) bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings of Optasite Towers.

As of December 31, 2008, the
outstanding balance under the Optasite Credit Facility was $149.0 million and the accreted carrying value was $146.4 million. The interest rate for amounts borrowed under the Optasite Credit Facility as of December 31, 2008 was 2.9%.

Optasite

Additional CMBS Certificate Swaps

At various dates during 2006, in anticipation of the Additional CMBS Transaction (see Note 12), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered
into nine forward-starting interest rate swap agreements (the “Additional CMBS Certificate Swaps”), with an aggregate notional principal amount of $1.0 billion, to hedge the variability of future interest rates in anticipation of the
issuance of debt, which the Company originally expected to be issued on or before December 21, 2007. Under the Additional CMBS Certificate Swaps, the subsidiary had agreed to pay a fixed interest rate ranging from 5.019% to 5.47% on the total
notional amount of $1.0 billion, beginning on the originally expected debt issuance dates for a period of five years, in exchange for receiving floating payments based on the three month LIBOR on the same $1.0 billion notional amount for the same
five year period.

On October 30, 2006, an indirect subsidiary of the Company entered into a purchase agreement with JP Morgan
Securities, Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. regarding the purchase and sale of $1.15 billion of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates issued by the Trust, a trust established by the Depositor. In connection with
this agreement, the Company terminated the Additional CMBS Certificate Swaps, resulting in a $14.5 million settlement payment by the Company which was recorded in the Statements of Cash Flows as a financing activity. The Company determined a portion
of the swaps to be ineffective, and as a result, the Company recorded $1.7 million as interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2006. The additional deferred loss of $12.8 million of the Additional CMBS Certificate Swaps
was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as it was determined to be an effective cash flow hedge. The deferred loss is being amortized utilizing the
effective interest method over the anticipated five year life of the Additional CMBS Certificates and increases the effective interest rate on these certificates by 0.3% over the weighted average fixed interest rate of 6.0%. The unamortized value of
the net deferred loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. For 2008, 2007 and 2006, amortization of $2.4 million, $2.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, was recorded as
interest expense.

Initial CMBS Certificates Swaps

On June 22, 2005, in anticipation of the Initial CMBS Transaction (see Note 12), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into two forward-starting interest rate swap agreements (the
“Initial CMBS Certificate Swaps”), each with a notional principal amount of $200.0 million to hedge the variability of future interest rates on the Initial CMBS Transaction. Under the swap agreements, the subsidiary agreed to pay the
counterparties a fixed interest rate of 4.199% on the total notional amount of $400.0 million, beginning on December 22, 2005 through December 22, 2010 in exchange for receiving floating payments based on the three-month LIBOR on the same
notional amount for the same five-year period.

On November 4, 2005, an indirect subsidiary of the Company entered into a purchase
agreement with Lehman Brothers Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. regarding the purchase and sale of $405.0 million of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates issued by the Trust, a trust established by the Depositor. In connection with
this agreement, the Company terminated the Initial CMBS Certificate Swaps, resulting in a $14.8 million settlement payment to the Company which was recorded in the Statements of Cash Flows as a financing activity. The Company determined the Initial
CMBS Certificate Swaps to be effective cash flow hedges and recorded the deferred gain of the Initial CMBS Certificate Swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The deferred gain is being amortized utilizing the effective interest method over the anticipated five year life of the Initial CMBS Certificates and reduces the effective interest rate on the Certificates by 0.8%. For 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
Company recorded as an offset to interest expense amortization of $3.0 million, $2.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively.

14. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

a. Common Stock

The Company has potential common stock equivalents related to its
outstanding stock options and Convertible Senior Notes (see Note 12). These potential common stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per common share and the weighted average number of shares used in the computation are the same for the years presented.

In May 2008, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 3.47 million shares, valued at approximately $120.0 million based on the closing
stock price of $34.55 on May 12, 2008, in connection with the issuance of the 1.875% Notes (See Note 12).

On March 19, 2007, the
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock from time to time until December 31, 2007. In March 2007, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 3.24 million shares
valued at approximately $91.2 million based on the closing price of $28.20 on March 20, 2007, in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% Notes (see Note 12).

b. Registration of Additional Shares

The Company filed shelf registration statements on Form
S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering 4.0 million, 4.0 million, 5.0 million and 3.0 million of its Class A common stock in 2007, 2006, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These shares may be issued in
connection with acquisitions of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company issued approximately 1.3 million shares, 4.7 million shares
and 1.8 million shares, respectively, of its Class A common stock pursuant to these registration statements in connection with acquisitions. At December 31, 2008, approximately 2.6 million shares remain available for issuance
under the shelf registration statement dated November 16, 2007.

On November 12, 2008, the Company filed a registration statement
on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering 0.5 million shares of its Class A common stock issuable under the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

On November 27, 2006, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering an additional

which may be represented by depositary shares, unsecured senior, senior subordinated or subordinated debt securities, and warrants to purchase any of these securities. Under the rules governing the automatic shelf registration statements, the
Company will file a prospectus supplement and advise the Commission of the amount and type of securities each time the Company issues securities under this registration statement. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company did not
issue any securities under this shelf registration statement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On May 17, 2007, the Company filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement
on Form S-3 registering the resale by selling securityholders of our 0.375% Notes and shares of our Class A Common Stock which are issuable upon conversion of the 0.375% Notes. The 0.375% Notes were originally issued in a private placement on
March 26, 2007.

c. Other Common Stock Transactions

During 2008, in connection with the Optasite acquisition, the Company issued 7.25 million shares of its Class A common stock.

During 2006, in connection with the AAT Acquisition, the Company issued 17.1 million shares of its Class A common stock.

d. Shareholder Rights Plan and Preferred Stock

During January 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a
shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock. Each of these rights which are currently not exercisable will entitle the holder to purchase one
one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of the Company’s newly designated Series E Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event that any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the
Company’s common stock or commences or announces an intention to commence a tender offer that would result in such person or group owning 15% or more of the Company’s common stock, each holder of a right (other than the acquirer) will be
entitled to receive, upon payment of the exercise price, a number of shares of common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. In order to retain flexibility and the ability to maximize shareholder value in the
event of transactions that may arise in the future, the Board retains the power to redeem the rights for a set amount. The rights were distributed on January 25, 2002 and expire on January 10, 2012, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged or
terminated in accordance with the Rights Agreement.

15. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “

Share-Based Payment

,” (“SFAS No. 123R”), which
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. SFAS No. 123R supersedes
the Company’s previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Company’s
consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 96-18,

“Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services.”

In accordance with EITF 96-18, the stock options
granted to non-employees are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock on the “valuation date,” which for options to non-employees is the vesting date. Expense
related to the options granted to non-employees is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period.

In September 2006, pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 108, “

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

”, the Company corrected a cumulative error in its accounting for equity-based compensation by recording a non-cash cumulative effect adjustment of $8.4 million to additional
paid-in capital with an offsetting amount of $7.7 million to accumulated deficit within shareholders’ equity as well as adjustments to property and equipment in the amount of $0.4 million and intangible assets of $0.3 million in its
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. The capitalized amounts relate to acquisition related costs.

Stock Options

The Company has three equity participation plans (the 1996 Stock Option Plan, the 1999 Equity Participation Plan and the 2001 Equity Participation Plan) whereby options (both non-qualified and incentive stock
options), stock appreciation rights and restricted stock may be granted to directors, employees and consultants. Upon adoption of the 2001 Equity Participation Plan, no further grants are permitted under the 1996 Stock Option Plan and the 1999
Equity Participation Plan. The 2001 Equity Participation Plan provides for a maximum issuance of shares, together with all outstanding options and unvested shares of restricted stock under all three of the plans, equal to 15% of the Company’s
Class A common stock outstanding, adjusted for shares issued and the exercise of certain options. These options generally vest between three and four years from the date of grant on a straight-line basis and generally have a seven-year or a
ten-year life.

From time to time, restricted shares of Class A common stock or options to purchase Class A common stock have
been granted under the Company’s equity participation plans at prices below market value at the time of grant. The Company did not have any non-cash compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
relating to the issuance of these shares or options. The Company recorded approximately $0.4 million of non-cash compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006, relating to the issuance of these shares or options.

The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses a combination of historical data and implied volatility to establish the expected volatility. Historical data is used to estimate the expected
option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options
granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:

A summary of shares reserved for future issuance under these plans as of December 31, 2008 is
as follows:

The following table summarizes the Company’s activities with respect to its stock option
plans for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 as follows (dollars and number of shares in thousands, except for per share data):

stock that had not yet vested and were expected to vest in future periods at a weighted average exercise price of $25.64. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options in the preceding tables represents the total intrinsic value, based on the
Company’s closing stock price of $16.32 as of December 31, 2008. The amount represents the total intrinsic value that would have been received by the holders of the stock-based awards had these awards been exercised and sold as of that
date.

As of December 31, 2008, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options outstanding under the Plans
is $18.9 million. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.

The total fair value of shares
vested during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $6.2 million, $4.7 million, and $4.1 million, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 1999 Stock Purchase Plan (the “1999 Purchase Plan”). A total of 500,000 shares of
Class A common stock were reserved for purchase under the 1999 Purchase Plan. During 2003, an amendment to the 1999 Purchase Plan was adopted which increased the number of shares reserved for purchase from 500,000 to 1,500,000 shares. During
2008, the Company adopted the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2008 Purchase Plan”) which reserved 500,000 shares of Class A common stock for purchase. The 1999 and 2008 Purchase Plans permit eligible employee participants to
purchase Class A common stock at a price per share which is equal to 85% of the fair market value of Class A common stock on the last day

of an offering period. For the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 41,000 shares of Class A common stock were issued under the 1999
Purchase Plan, which resulted in cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 when approximately 39,700 shares of Class A common stock were issued under the 1999 Purchase Plan,
which resulted in cash proceeds to the Company of $1.0 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately 547,000 shares remained available for issuance under the 1999 Purchase Plan. There were no shares issued under the 2008 Purchase Plan in 2008
and there will be no subsequent share issuances under the 1999 Purchase Plan. In addition, the Company recorded $0.2 million of non-cash compensation expense relating to the shares issued under the 1999 Purchase Plan for each of the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

compensation for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, to fixed and intangible assets.

16. ASSET IMPAIRMENT
AND OTHER (CREDITS) CHARGES

The Company evaluated its individual long-lived assets, including the intangibles with finite lives, and
the tower sites, for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

As a result of the annual impairment evaluation, the Company recorded a $0.9 million impairment charge on
eight towers that had not achieved expected lease-up results as determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis.

During 2006, the
Company reevaluated the remaining liability relating to its restructuring program initiated in 2002. The Company determined that the liability was no longer needed as all office space included in the restructuring liability is now being fully
utilized by the Company in its operations. As a result, the Company recorded a credit of $0.4 million which is included in asset impairments and other (credits) charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended
December 31, 2006.

The components of the net deferred income tax asset (liability) accounts are as follows:

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as management believes that
it is not “more likely than not” that the Company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to recognize the assets. The net change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006 was $(47.4) million, $(22.2) million, and $(160.1) million, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2008 the Company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $0.6 million relating to tax credit carryovers that expire beginning
2025.

The Company has available at December 31, 2008, a net federal operating tax loss carry-forward of approximately $931.4 million
and an additional $87.9 million of net operating tax loss carry forward from stock options which will benefit additional paid-in capital when the loss is utilized. These net operating tax loss carry-forwards will expire between 2019 and 2028. The
Internal Revenue Code places limitations upon the future availability of net operating losses based upon changes in the equity of the Company. If these occur, the ability of the Company to offset future income with existing net operating losses may
be limited. In addition, the Company has available at December 31, 2008, a net state operating tax loss carry-forward of approximately $625.1 million. These net operating tax loss carry-forwards will expire between 2009 and 2028.

In accordance with the Company’s methodology for determining when stock option deductions are deemed realized under SFAS 123(R), the Company
utilizes a “with-and-without” approach that will result in a benefit not being recorded in APIC if the amount of available net operating loss carryforwards generated from operations is sufficient to offset the current year taxable income.

Contingent Purchase Obligations

From time to time, the Company
agrees to pay additional consideration for acquisitions if the towers or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets in the 1-3 years after they have been acquired. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has an
obligation to pay up to an additional $9.4 million in consideration if the targets contained in various acquisition agreements are met. These obligations are associated with new build and tower acquisition programs within the Company’s site
leasing segment. On certain acquisitions, at the Company’s option, additional consideration may be paid in cash or shares of Class A common stock. The Company records such obligations as additional consideration when it becomes probable
that the targets will be met. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, certain earnings targets associated with the acquired towers were achieved, and therefore, the Company paid in cash $3.5 million and $5.5 million, respectively. For
the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company issued approximately 67,000 shares of Class A common stock in settlement of contingent price amounts payable as a result of acquired towers exceeding certain performance targets. During the
year ended December 31, 2007, the Company did not issue shares of Class A Common stock in settlement of contingent price amounts.

20. DEFINED
CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The Company has a defined contribution profit sharing plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
that provides for voluntary employee contributions up to $15,500 of compensation. Employees have the opportunity to participate following completion of three months of employment and must be 21 years of age. Employer matching begins immediately upon
the employee’s participation in the plan. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company made a discretionary matching contribution of 50% of an employee’s contributions up to a maximum of $3,000. Company matching
contributions were approximately $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.5 million for years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

21. PENSION PLANS

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) for all employees of AAT Communications hired on or before January 1, 1996. AAT ceased all benefit accruals for active participants on
December 31, 1996. The Pension Plan was included in the acquisition of AAT Communications by the Company. The Pension Plan provides for defined benefits based on the number of years of service and average salary.

During 2008, the Company began the process of terminating the Pension Plan. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service on the termination of the Pension Plan. The Company liquidated the assets of the Pension Plan and began final distribution of the assets. As a result of terminating the plan, the Company
recorded a settlement expense of $0.6 million in connection with the projected final benefit settlement which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2008, the
Company paid $1.3 million and has a remaining liability of $0.8 million for the remaining termination payments which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In December 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, which required the Company to recognize assets for
all of its overfunded postretirement benefit plans and liabilities for its underfunded plans at December 31, 2006, with a corresponding noncash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in shareholders’ equity. The
funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation (PBO) of the plan. The adjustment to shareholders’ equity represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and
prior service costs in accordance with SFAS No. 87.

The unrecognized amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net
will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost. Actuarial gains and losses that arise in future periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in those periods will be recognized as increases or decreases in other
comprehensive income, net of tax, in the period they arise. Actuarial gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost.

The incremental impact of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 158 on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2006 was to record $0.1
million of additional liability which was recorded in other long-term liabilities and in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The adoption of FAS 158 had no effect on the Company’s
Statements of Operations or Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. Due to the termination of the plan in 2008, the Company recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost all amounts in accumulated other
comprehensive income.

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
number of shares for the period. Diluted net income per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive
common shares arising from the assumed exercise of stock options and convertible debt, if dilutive. The dilutive impact of potentially dilutive stock options is determined by applying the treasury stock method and the dilutive impact of the
convertible debt is determined by applying the “if converted” method. Potentially dilutive shares for the periods prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2008 have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their
impact would have been anti-dilutive.

Because loss per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of common and
dilutive common shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total loss per share amounts for the year.
