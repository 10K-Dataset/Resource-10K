Item 1. Business

ENERAL

Dominion Energy

,
headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1983, is one of the nation’s largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominion Energy’s strategy is to be a leading provider of electricity, natural gas and related
services to customers primarily in the eastern and Rocky Mountain regions of the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy’s portfolio of assets includes approximately 26,000 MW of generating capacity, 6,600 miles of electric
transmission lines, 57,900 miles of electric distribution lines, 14,800 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines and 51,800 miles of gas distribution pipeline, exclusive of service lines. As of December 31, 2017,
Dominion Energy serves nearly 6 million utility and retail energy customers and operates one of the nation’s largest underground natural gas storage systems, with approximately 1 trillion cubic feet of storage capacity.

In September 2016, Dominion Energy completed the Dominion Energy Questar Combination for total consideration of $4.4 billion and Dominion
Energy Questar, a Rockies-based integrated natural gas company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy. Questar Gas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy Questar, is consolidated by Dominion Energy, and is a voluntary SEC filer.
However, its Form

10-K

is filed separately and is not combined herein.

In March 2014, Dominion
Energy formed Dominion Energy Midstream, an MLP designed to grow a portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets. In October 2014, Dominion Energy Midstream launched its initial public offering and
issued 20,125,000 common units representing limited partner interests. Dominion Energy has and may continue to investigate opportunities to acquire assets that meet its strategic objective for Dominion Energy Midstream. At December 31, 2017,
Dominion Energy owns the general partner, 50.6% of the common and subordinated units and 37.5% of the convertible preferred interests in Dominion Energy Midstream, which owns a preferred equity interest and the general partner interest in Cove
Point, DECG, Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline and a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. Dominion Energy Midstream is consolidated by Dominion Energy, and is an SEC registrant. However, its Form

10-K

is filed separately and is not combined herein.

Dominion Energy is focused on expanding its
investment in regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution and regulated natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure. Dominion Energy expects approximately 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from
regulated and long-term contracted businesses.

Dominion Energy continues to expand and improve its regulated and long-term contracted
electric and natural gas businesses, in accordance with its existing five-year capital investment program. A major impetus for this program is to meet the anticipated increase in demand in its electric utility service territory. Other drivers for
the capital investment program include the construction of infrastructure to handle the increase in natural gas production from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, to upgrade Dominion Energy’s gas and electric transmission and
distribution networks, and to meet environmental requirements

and standards set by various regulatory bodies. Investments in utility-scale solar generation are expected to be a focus in meeting such environmental requirements, particularly in Virginia. In
September 2014, Dominion Energy announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately

600-mile

natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia
through Virginia to North Carolina, to increase natural gas supplies in the region.

Dominion Energy has transitioned over the past decade
to a more regulated, less volatile earnings mix as evidenced by its capital investments in regulated infrastructure, including the Dominion Energy Questar Combination, and in infrastructure whose output is sold under long-term purchase agreements as
well as the sale of the electric retail energy marketing business in March 2014. Dominion Energy’s nonregulated operations include merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities and natural gas retail energy
marketing operations. Dominion Energy’s operations are conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas.

Virginia Power

, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1909 as a Virginia public service corporation, is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy and a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and North Carolina. In Virginia, Virginia Power conducts business under the name “Dominion
Energy Virginia” and primarily serves retail customers. In North Carolina, it conducts business under the name “Dominion Energy North Carolina” and serves retail customers located in the northeastern region of the state, excluding
certain municipalities. In addition, Virginia Power sells electricity at wholesale prices to rural electric cooperatives, municipalities and into wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Power’s stock is owned by Dominion Energy.

Dominion Energy Gas,

a limited liability company formed in September 2013,

is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy and a
holding company. It serves as the intermediate parent company for certain of Dominion Energy’s regulated natural gas operating subsidiaries, which conduct business activities through a regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and

Power Delivery

The Power Delivery Operating Segment of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power

includes Virginia Power’s regulated electric transmission and
distribution (including customer service) operations, which serve approximately 2.6 million residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in Virginia and North Carolina.

Power Delivery’s existing five-year investment plan includes spending approximately $8.5 billion from 2018 through 2022 to upgrade
or add new transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory and maintain reliability and regulatory compliance. The proposed electric delivery infrastructure
projects are intended to address both continued customer growth and increases in electricity consumption. In addition, data centers continue to contribute to anticipated demand growth.

Revenue provided by electric distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law.
Variability in earnings is driven primarily by changes in rates, weather, customer growth and other factors impacting consumption such as the economy and energy conservation, in addition to operating and maintenance expenditures. Operationally,
electric distribution continues to focus on improving service levels while striving to reduce costs and link investments to operational results. SAIDI performance results, excluding major events, were 117 minutes at the end of 2017, down from the
three-year average of 123 minutes. Virginia Power’s overall customer satisfaction improved year over year when compared to 2016 J.D.



Power and Associates’ scoring. In the future, safety, electric service reliability, outage durations and customer service will remain key focus areas for electric distribution. Modernizing
the electric grid will become a key focus area to support the enhancement of the customer service experience, build upon improvements in resiliency and security and support enhanced innovation and renewable generation.

Revenue provided by Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by FERC. The profitability of
this business is dependent on its ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings primarily results from changes in rates and the timing of
property additions, retirements and depreciation.

Virginia Power is a member of PJM, a RTO, and its electric transmission facilities are
integrated into PJM wholesale electricity markets. Consistent with the increased authority given to NERC by EPACT, Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations are committed to meeting NERC standards, modernizing its infrastructure and
maintaining superior system reliability. Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations will continue to focus on safety, operational performance, NERC compliance and execution of PJM’s RTEP.

C

OMPETITION

Power Delivery Operating
Segment— Dominion Energy and Virginia Power

There is no competition for electric distribution service within Virginia Power’s service
territory in Virginia and North Carolina and no such competition is currently permitted. Historically, since its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM and electric transmission services are administered by PJM, there was no
competition in relation to transmission service provided to customers within the PJM region. However, competition from

non-incumbent

PJM transmission owners for development, construction and ownership of
certain transmission facilities in Virginia Power’s service territory is now permitted pursuant to Order 1000, subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals. This could result in additional competition to build and own transmission
infrastructure in Virginia Power’s service area in the future and could allow Dominion Energy to seek opportunities to build and own facilities in other service territories.

EGULATION

Power Delivery Operating
Segment—Dominion Energy and Virginia Power

Virginia Power’s electric distribution service, including the rates it may charge to
jurisdictional customers, is subject to regulation by the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. Virginia Power’s wholesale electric transmission rates, tariffs and terms of service are subject to regulation by FERC. Electric transmission
siting authority remains the jurisdiction of the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. However, EPACT provides FERC with certain backstop authority for transmission siting. See

ROPERTIES

Power Delivery Operating Segment—Dominion Energy and Virginia Power

Virginia Power has approximately 6,600 miles of electric transmission lines of 69 kV or more located in North
Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Portions of Virginia Power’s electric transmission lines cross national parks and forests under permits entitling the federal government to use, at specified charges, any surplus capacity that may exist in
these lines. While Virginia Power owns and maintains its electric transmission facilities, they are a part of PJM, which coordinates the planning, operation, emergency assistance and exchange of capacity and energy for such facilities.

As a part of PJM’s RTEP process, PJM authorized the following material reliability projects (including Virginia Power’s estimated
cost):

•

Surry-to-Skiffes

In addition, in December 2017, the Virginia Commission granted Virginia Power a CPCN to rebuild and operate in Lancaster County, Virginia and
Middlesex County, Virginia, approximately 2 miles of existing 115 kV transmission lines to be constructed under the Rappahannock River between Harmony Village Substation and White Stone Substation. The total estimated cost of the project is
approximately $85 million.

Virginia Power plans to increase transmission substation physical security and expects to invest $250
million—$300 million through 2022 to strengthen its electrical system to better protect critical equipment, enhance its spare equipment process and create multiple levels of security.

In addition, Virginia Power’s electric distribution network includes approximately 57,900 miles of distribution lines, exclusive of
service level lines, in Virginia and North Carolina. The grants for most of its electric lines contain

rights-of-way

that have been obtained from the apparent owners of
real estate, but underlying titles have not been examined. Where

rights-of-way

have not been obtained, they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation, if
necessary. Many electric lines are on publicly-owned property, where permission to operate can be revoked.



Virginia legislation in 2014 provides for the recovery of costs, subject to approval by the
Virginia Commission, for Virginia Power to move approximately 4,000 miles of electric distribution lines underground. The program is designed to reduce restoration outage time by moving Virginia Power’s most outage-prone overhead distribution
lines underground, has an annual investment cap of approximately $175 million and is expected to be completed over the next decade. In August 2016, the Virginia Commission approved the first phase of the program encompassing approximately 400
miles of converted lines and $140 million in capital spending (with approximately $123 million recoverable through Rider U). In September 2017, the Virginia Commission approved recovery through Rider U of a total capital investment of
$40 million for second phase conversions.

S

EASONALITY

Power Delivery Operating Segment—Dominion Energy and Virginia Power

Power Delivery’s earnings vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature, the impact of storms and other catastrophic weather
events, and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. An increase in
heating degree days for Power Delivery’s electric utility-related operations does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree days, due to seasonal pricing differentials and because alternative heating sources are
more readily available.

Power Generation

The Power
Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power

includes the generation operations of the Virginia Power regulated electric utility and its related energy supply operations. Virginia Power’s utility generation operations primarily serve the
supply requirements for Power Delivery’s utility customers.

The Power Generation Operating Segment of Dominion Energy

includes Virginia Power’s generation facilities and its related energy supply operations as well as the generation
operations of Dominion Energy’s merchant fleet and energy marketing and price risk management activities for these assets.

Power
Generation’s existing five-year investment plan includes spending approximately $8.3 billion from 2018 through 2022 to construct new generation capacity and extend the life of nuclear generation facilities to meet growing electricity
demand within its service territory and maintain reliability. The most significant project currently under construction is Greensville County, which is estimated to cost approximately $1.3 billion, excluding financing costs. See

Properties

and

Environmental Strat

egy

for additional information on this and other utility projects.

In addition, Dominion Energy’s merchant fleet includes numerous renewable generation
facilities, which include a fuel cell generation facility in Connecticut and solar generation facilities in operation or development in nine states, including Virginia. The output of these facilities is primarily sold under long-term power purchase
agreements with terms generally ranging from 15 to 25 years. See Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain solar projects.

Earnings for the

Power Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power

primarily result from the sale of electricity generated by its
utility fleet. Revenue is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Approximately 82% of revenue comes from serving Virginia jurisdictional customers. Base rates for the Virginia jurisdiction are set using a
modified

cost-of-service

rate model, and are generally designed to allow an opportunity to recover the cost of providing utility service and earn a reasonable return on
investments used to provide that service. Earnings variability may arise when revenues are impacted by factors not reflected in current rates, such as the impact of weather on customers’ demand for services. Likewise, earnings may reflect
variations in the timing or nature of expenses as compared to those contemplated in current rates, such as labor and benefit costs, capacity expenses, and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. The cost of fuel and
purchased power is generally collected through fuel cost-recovery mechanisms established by regulators and does not materially impact net income. The cost of new generation facilities is generally recovered through rate adjustment clauses in
Virginia. Variability in earnings from rate adjustment clauses reflects changes in the authorized ROE and the carrying amount of these facilities, which are largely driven by the timing and amount of capital investments, as well as depreciation. See
Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The Power Generation Operating Segment of Dominion
Energy

derives its earnings primarily from the sale of electricity generated by Virginia Power’s utility and Dominion Energy’s merchant generation assets, as well as from associated capacity and ancillary services. Variability in
earnings provided by Dominion Energy’s nonrenewable merchant fleet relates to changes in market-based prices received for electricity and capacity. Market-based prices for electricity are largely dependent on commodity prices, primarily natural
gas, and the demand for electricity, which is primarily dependent upon weather. Capacity prices are dependent upon resource requirements in relation to the supply available (both existing and new) in the forward capacity auctions, which are held
approximately three years in advance of the associated delivery year. Dominion Energy manages the electric price volatility of its merchant fleet by hedging a substantial portion of its expected near-term energy sales with derivative instruments.
Variability also results from changes in the cost of fuel consumed, labor and benefits and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. Variability in earnings provided by Dominion Energy’s renewable merchant fleet is
primarily driven by weather.

C

OMPETITION

Power Generation Operating Segment—Dominion Energy and Virginia Power



Virginia Power’s generation operations are not subject to significant competition as only a limited number
of its Virginia jurisdictional electric utility customers have retail choice. See

Electric

under

State Regulations

in

Regulation

for more information. Currently, North Carolina does not offer retail choice to electric customers.

Power Generation Operating Segment—Dominion Energy

Power Generation’s recently acquired and developed renewable generation projects are not currently subject to significant competition as the output from
these facilities is primarily sold under long-term power purchase agreements with terms generally ranging from 15 to 25 years. Competition for the nonrenewable merchant fleet is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants,
construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. These competitive factors may negatively impact
the merchant fleet’s ability to profit from the sale of electricity and related products and services.

Unlike Power
Generation’s regulated generation fleet, its nonrenewable merchant generation fleet is dependent on its ability to operate in a competitive environment and does not have a predetermined rate structure that provides for a rate of return on its
capital investments. Power Generation’s nonrenewable merchant assets operate within functioning RTOs and primarily compete on the basis of price. Competitors include other generating assets bidding to operate within the RTOs. Power
Generation’s nonrenewable merchant units compete in the wholesale market with other generators to sell a variety of products including energy, capacity and ancillary services. It is difficult to compare various types of generation given the
wide range of fuels, fuel procurement strategies, efficiencies and operating characteristics of the fleet within any given RTO. However, Dominion Energy applies its expertise in operations, dispatch and risk management to maximize the degree to
which its nonrenewable merchant fleet is competitive compared to similar assets within the region.

In November 2017, Connecticut adopted
the Act Concerning Zero Carbon Solicitation and Procurement, which allows nuclear generating facilities to compete for power purchase agreements in a state sponsored procurement for electricity. In February 2018, Connecticut regulators recommended
pursuing the procurement. They are expected to issue a request for proposals by May 1, 2018. Millstone will participate in the state sponsored procurement. If successful in the competitive bid process, Millstone would receive a long-term power
purchase agreement for between three and ten years.

ECOMMISSIONING

Power Generation Operating Segment—Dominion Energy and Virginia Power

Virginia Power has a total of four licensed, operating nuclear reactors at Surry and North Anna in Virginia.

Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once operations have ceased,
in accordance with standards established by the NRC. Amounts collected from ratepayers are placed into trusts and are invested to fund the expected future costs of decommissioning the Surry and North Anna units.

Virginia Power believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient to
cover expected decommissioning costs, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects the long-term investment
horizon, since the units will not be decommissioned for decades, and a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns. Virginia Power will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance
requirements, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC.

The estimated cost to decommission Virginia Power’s four nuclear units is reflected in the table below and is primarily based upon
site-specific studies completed in 2014. These cost studies are generally completed every four to five years. The current cost estimates assume decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations, which will occur when the
operating licenses expire.

Under the current operating licenses, Virginia Power is scheduled to decommission the Surry and North Anna
units during the period 2032 to 2078. NRC regulations allow licensees to apply for extension of an operating license in up to

20-year

increments. Virginia Power has announced its intention to apply for
operating life extensions for Surry and North Anna.

Power Generation Operating Segment—Dominion Energy

In addition to the four nuclear units discussed above, Dominion Energy has two licensed, operating nuclear reactors at Millstone in Connecticut. A third
Millstone unit ceased operations before Dominion Energy acquired the power station. In May 2013, Dominion Energy ceased operations at its single Kewaunee unit in Wisconsin and commenced decommissioning activities using the SAFSTOR methodology. The
planned decommissioning completion date is 2073, which is within the NRC allowed

60-year

window.



As part of Dominion Energy’s acquisition of both Millstone and Kewaunee, it acquired
decommissioning funds for the related units. Any funds remaining in Kewaunee’s trust after decommissioning is completed are required to be refunded to Wisconsin ratepayers. Dominion Energy believes that the amounts currently available in the
decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone and Kewaunee units. Dominion Energy will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial
assurance requirements, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. The estimated cost to decommission Dominion Energy’s eight units is reflected in
the table below and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed for Surry, North Anna and Millstone in 2014 and for Kewaunee in 2013.

The estimated decommissioning costs and license expiration dates for the nuclear units owned by Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are shown

Gas Infrastructure

The Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment of Dominion Energy Gas

includes certain of Dominion Energy’s regulated natural gas operations.
DETI, the gas transmission pipeline and storage business, serves gas distribution businesses and other customers in the Northeast,

mid-Atlantic

and Midwest. East Ohio, the primary gas distribution business of
Dominion Energy Gas, serves residential, commercial and industrial gas sales, transportation and gathering service customers primarily in Ohio. DGP conducts gas gathering and processing activities, which include the sale of extracted products at
market rates, primarily in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Dominion Iroquois holds a 24.07% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, which provides service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power
generators, as well as marketers and other end users, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges primarily in New York.

The Gas
Infrastructure Operating Segment of Dominion Energy

includes LNG operations, Dominion Energy Questar operations, Hope’s gas distribution operations in West Virginia, and nonregulated retail natural gas marketing, as well as Dominion
Energy’s investments in the Blue Racer joint venture, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Dominion Energy Midstream. See

Properties and Investments

below for additional information regarding the Blue Racer and Atlantic Coast Pipeline
investments. Dominion Energy’s LNG operations involve the import and storage of LNG at Cove Point and the transportation of regasified LNG to the interstate pipeline grid and

mid-Atlantic

and Northeast
markets. Dominion Energy has received DOE and FERC approval to export LNG from Cove Point and, once the Liquefaction Project commences commercial operations, will be able to import LNG and regasify it as natural gas and liquefy natural gas and
export it as LNG. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

In September 2016, Dominion Energy
completed the Dominion Energy Questar Combination and Dominion Energy Questar, a Rockies-based integrated natural gas company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy. Dominion Energy Questar included Questar Gas, Wexpro and Dominion
Energy Questar Pipeline at closing. Questar Gas’ regulated gas distribution operations in Utah, southwestern Wyoming and southeastern Idaho includes 29,600 miles of gas distribution pipeline. Wexpro develops and produces natural gas from
reserves supplied to Questar Gas under a

cost-of-service

framework. Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline provides FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transportation and
storage services in Utah, Wyoming and western Colorado through 2,200 miles of gas transmission pipeline and 56 bcf of working gas storage. See

Acquisitions and

Dispositions

above and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
a description of the Dominion Energy Questar Combination.

In 2014, Dominion Energy formed Dominion Energy Midstream, an MLP initially
consisting of a preferred equity interest in Cove Point. See

General

above for more information. Also see

Acquisitions and Dispositions

above

and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of Dominion
Energy’s contribution of Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline to



Dominion Energy Midstream in December 2016 as well as Dominion Energy’s acquisition of DECG, which Dominion Energy contributed to Dominion Energy Midstream in April 2015, and Dominion Energy
Midstream’s acquisition of a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois in September 2015. DECG provides FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transportation services in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia through 1,500 miles of
gas transmission pipeline.

Gas Infrastructure’s existing five-year investment plan includes spending approximately $8.3 billion
from 2018 through 2022 to upgrade existing or add new infrastructure to meet growing energy needs within its service territory and maintain reliability. Demand for natural gas is expected to continue to grow as initiatives to transition to gas from
more carbon-intensive fuels are implemented. This plan includes Dominion Energy’s portion of spending for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project.

Earnings for the

Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment of Dominion Energy Gas

primarily result from rates established by FERC and the
Ohio Commission. The profitability of this business is dependent on Dominion Energy Gas’ ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings
results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy.

Approximately 91% of DETI’s transmission capacity is subscribed including 86% under long-term contracts (two years or greater) and 5% on
a

year-to-year

basis. DETI’s storage services are 100% subscribed with long-term contracts.

Revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at market prices. For DGP’s
processing plants, Dominion Energy Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain the extracted NGLs as compensation for its services. This exposes Dominion Energy Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between
the NGL products and natural gas. In addition, Dominion Energy Gas has volumetric risk as the majority of customers receiving these services are not required to deliver minimum quantities of gas.

East Ohio utilizes a straight-fixed-variable rate design for a majority of its customers. Under this rate design, East Ohio recovers a large
portion of its fixed operating costs through a flat monthly charge accompanied by a reduced volumetric base delivery rate. Accordingly, East Ohio’s revenue is less impacted by weather-related fluctuations in natural gas consumption than under
the traditional rate design.

Earnings for the

Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment of Dominion Energy

primarily include the
results of rates established by FERC and the West Virginia, Utah, Wyoming and Idaho Commissions. Additionally, Dominion Energy receives revenue from firm

fee-based

contractual arrangements, including
negotiated rates, for certain LNG storage and terminalling services. Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline’s and DECG’s revenues are primarily derived from reservation charges for firm transportation and storage services as provided for in
their FERC-approved tariffs. Revenue provided by Questar Gas’ operations is based primarily on rates established by the Utah and Wyoming Commissions. The Idaho Commission has contracted with the

Utah Commission for rate oversight of Questar Gas operations in a small area of southeastern Idaho. Hope’s gas distribution operations in West Virginia serve residential, commercial, sale
for resale and industrial gas sales, transportation and gathering service customers. Revenue provided by Hope’s operations is based primarily on rates established by the West Virginia Commission. The profitability of these businesses is
dependent on their ability, through the rates they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on their capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well
as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy.

C

OMPETITION

Gas Infrastructure
Operating Segment—Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas

Dominion Energy Gas’ natural gas transmission operations compete with domestic
and Canadian pipeline companies. Dominion Energy Gas also competes with gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services. Alternative fuel sources, such as oil or coal, provide another level of competition.
Although competition is based primarily on price, the array of services that can be provided to customers is also an important factor. The combination of capacity rights held on certain long-line pipelines, a large storage capability and the
availability of numerous receipt and delivery points along its own pipeline system enable Dominion Energy to tailor its services to meet the needs of individual customers.

DGP’s processing and fractionation operations face competition in obtaining natural gas supplies for its processing and related services.
Numerous factors impact any given customer’s choice of processing services provider, including the location of the facilities, efficiency and reliability of operations, and the pricing arrangements offered.

In Ohio, there has been no legislation enacted to require supplier choice for natural gas distribution consumers. However, East Ohio has
offered an Energy Choice program to residential and commercial customers since October 2000. East Ohio has since taken various steps approved by the Ohio Commission toward exiting the merchant function, including restructuring its commodity service
and placing Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct retail relationship with participating suppliers. Further, in April 2013, East Ohio fully exited the merchant function for its nonresidential customers, which are now required to choose a
retail supplier or be assigned to one at a monthly variable rate set by the supplier. At December 31, 2017, approximately 1 million of East Ohio’s 1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in the Energy Choice program.

Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment—Dominion Energy

Questar Gas and Hope do not currently face direct competition from other distributors of natural gas for residential and commercial customers in their service
territories as state regulations in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho for Questar Gas, and West Virginia for Hope, do not allow customers to choose their provider at this time. See

State Regulations

in

Regulation

for additional information.



Cove Point’s gas transportation, LNG import and storage operations, as well as the
Liquefaction Project’s capacity are contracted primarily under long-term fixed reservation fee agreements. However, in the future Cove Point may compete with other independent terminal operators as well as major oil and gas companies on the
basis of terminal location, services provided and price. Competition from terminal operators primarily comes from refiners and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms.

Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline’s and DECG’s pipeline systems generate a substantial portion of their revenue from long-term firm
contracts for transportation services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. When these long-term contracts expire, Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline’s pipeline system faces competitive pressures
from similar facilities that serve the Rocky Mountain region and DECG’s pipeline system faces competitive pressures from similar facilities that serve the South Carolina and southeastern Georgia area in terms of location, rates, terms of
service, and flexibility and reliability of service.

Dominion Energy’s retail energy marketing operations compete against incumbent
utilities and other energy marketers in nonregulated energy markets for natural gas. In March 2014, Dominion Energy completed the sale of its electric retail energy marketing business. In October 2017, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement to
sell certain assets associated with its nonregulated retail energy marketing operations. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. The remaining retail natural gas business consists of approximately 350,000 customer accounts in five
states. The heaviest concentration of customers in these markets are located in states where utilities have the advantage of long-standing commitment to customer choice, primarily Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment—Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas

Dominion Energy Gas has the following significant projects under construction or development to better serve customers or expand its service offerings within
its service territory.

In January 2018, DETI filed an application to request FERC authorization to construct and operate certain
facilities located in Ohio and Pennsylvania for the Sweden Valley project. The project is expected to cost approximately $50 million and provide 120,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from Pennsylvania to Ohio for delivery to
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, L.L.C. The project’s capacity is fully subscribed pursuant to a precedent agreement with one customer and is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2019.

In September 2014, DETI announced its intent to construct and operate the Supply Header project which is estimated to cost between
$550 million and $600 million to construct, excluding financing costs, and provide 1,500,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service to various customers. In December 2014, DETI entered into a precedent agreement with Atlantic Coast
Pipeline for the Supply Header project. In October 2017, DETI received FERC authorization to construct and operate the project facilities, with the facilities expected to be in service in late 2019.

In 2008, East Ohio began PIR, aimed at replacing approximately 4,100 miles of its pipeline system at a cost of $2.7 billion. In 2011,
approval was obtained to include an additional 1,450 miles and to increase annual capital investment to meet the program goal. The program will replace approximately 25% of the pipeline system and is anticipated to take place over a total of 25
years. In March 2015, East Ohio filed an application with the Ohio Commission requesting approval to extend the PIR program for an additional five years and to increase the annual capital investment, with corresponding increases in the annual
rate-increase caps. In September 2016, the Ohio Commission approved a stipulation filed jointly by East Ohio and the Staff of the Ohio Commission to settle East Ohio’s pending application. As requested, the PIR program and associated cost
recovery will continue for another five-year term, calendar years 2017 through 2021, and East Ohio will be permitted to increase its annual capital expenditures to $200 million by 2018 and 3% per year thereafter subject to the cost
recovery rate increase caps proposed by East Ohio. Costs associated with calendar year 2016 investment will be recovered under the existing terms. In April 2017, the Ohio Commission approved East Ohio’s application to adjust the PIR cost
recovery rates for 2016 costs. The filing reflects gross plan investment for 2016 of $188 million, cumulative gross plant investment of $1.2 billion and a revenue requirement of $157 million.

Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment—Dominion Energy

Dominion Energy has the following significant projects under construction or development.

Cove Point—

Dominion Energy expects the Liquefaction Project to commence commercial operations in March 2018, which will enable the
Cove Point facility to liquefy domestically-produced natural gas and export it as LNG. The DOE previously authorized Dominion Energy to export LNG to countries with free trade agreements. In September 2013, the DOE authorized



Dominion Energy to export LNG from Cove Point to

non-free

trade agreement countries.

In September 2014, Cove Point received the FERC order authorizing the Liquefaction Project with certain conditions. The conditions regarding
the Liquefaction Project set forth in the FERC order largely incorporate the mitigation measures proposed in the environmental assessment. In October 2014, Cove Point commenced construction of the Liquefaction Project, with an

in-service

date anticipated in March 2018 at a total estimated cost of approximately $4.1 billion, excluding financing costs. The Cove Point facility is authorized to export at a rate of 770 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day for a period of 20 years.

In April 2013, Dominion Energy announced it had fully subscribed the capacity of
the project with

20-year

terminal service agreements. ST Cove Point, LLC, a joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese corporation that is one of the world’s leading trading companies, and Tokyo
Gas Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation that is the largest natural gas utility in Japan, and GAIL Global (USA) LNG LLC, a wholly-owned indirect U.S. subsidiary of GAIL (India) Ltd., have each contracted for half of the capacity. Following completion
of the

front-end

engineering and design work, Dominion Energy also announced it had awarded its engineering, procurement and construction contract for new liquefaction facilities to IHI/Kiewit Cove Point, a
joint venture between IHI E&C International Corporation and Kiewit Energy Company.

Cove Point has historically operated as an LNG
import facility under various long-term import contracts. Since 2010, Dominion Energy has renegotiated certain existing LNG import contracts in a manner that will result in a significant reduction in pipeline and storage capacity utilization and
associated anticipated revenues during the period from 2017 through 2028. Such amendments created the opportunity for Dominion Energy to explore the Liquefaction Project, which, will extend the economic life of Cove Point and contribute to
Dominion Energy’s overall growth plan. In total, these renegotiations reduced Cove Point’s expected annual revenues from the import-related contracts by approximately $150 million from 2017 through 2028, partially offset by
approximately $50 million of additional revenues in the years 2013 through 2017.

In June 2015, Cove Point executed binding
agreements with two customers for the approximately $150 million Eastern Market Access Project. In January 2018, Cove Point received FERC authorization to construct and operate the project facilities, which are expected to be placed into
service in early 2019.

DECG

—In 2014, DECG executed binding precedent agreements with three customers for the Charleston
project. The project is expected to cost approximately $125 million, and provide 80,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from an existing interconnect with Transcontinental Gas Pipe, LLC in Spartanburg County, South Carolina to
customers in Dillon, Marlboro, Sumter, Charleston, Lexington and Remington counties, South Carolina. In February 2017, DECG received FERC approval to construct and operate the project facilities, which are expected to be placed into service in March
2018.

Questar Gas

—In 2010, Questar Gas began replacing aging high pressure infrastructure under a cost-tracking mechanism
that allows it to place into rate base and earn a return on capital expenditures associated with a multi-year natural gas

infrastructure-replacement program upon the completion of each project. At that time, the commission-allowed annual spending in the replacement program was approximately $55 million.

In its 2014 Utah general rate case, Questar Gas received approval to include intermediate high pressure infrastructure in the replacement
program and increase the annual spending limit to approximately $65 million, adjusted annually using a gross domestic product inflation factor. At that time, 420 miles of high pressure pipe and 70 miles of intermediate high pressure pipe were
identified to be replaced in the program over a

17-year

period. Questar Gas has spent about $65 million each year through 2017 under this program. The program is evaluated in each Utah general rate case.
The next Utah general rate case is anticipated to occur in 2019.

Gas Infrastructure Equity Method Investments—

In September
2015, Dominion Energy, through Dominion Energy Midstream, acquired an additional 25.93% interest in Iroquois. Dominion Energy Gas holds a 24.07% interest with TransCanada holding a 50% interest. Iroquois owns and operates a

416-mile

FERC regulated interstate natural gas pipeline providing service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end-users, through
interconnecting pipelines and exchanges. Iroquois’ pipeline extends from the U.S.-Canadian border at Waddington, New York through the state of Connecticut to South Commack, Long Island, New York and continuing on from Northport, Long
Island, New York through the Long Island Sound to Hunts Point, Bronx, New York. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominion Energy’s equity method investment in Iroquois.

In September 2014, Dominion Energy, along with Duke and Southern Company Gas, announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The Atlantic
Coast Pipeline partnership agreement includes provisions to allow Dominion Energy an option to purchase additional ownership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline to maintain a leading ownership percentage. In October 2016, Dominion Energy purchased
an additional 3% membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline from Duke for $14 million. The members hold the following membership interests: Dominion Energy, 48%; Duke, 47%; and Southern Company Gas, 5%. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on
constructing an approximately

600-mile

natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina, with development and construction costs estimated between $6.0 billion and
$6.5 billion, excluding financing costs. In October 2014, Atlantic Coast Pipeline requested approval from FERC to utilize the

pre-filing

process under which environmental review for the natural gas
pipeline project will commence. Atlantic Coast Pipeline filed its FERC application in September 2015 and expects to be in service in late 2019. In October 2017, Atlantic Coast Pipeline received the FERC order authorizing the construction and
operation of the project. The FERC order has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the project remains subject to other pending federal and state approvals. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information about Dominion Energy’s equity method investment in Atlantic Coast Pipeline.

In December 2012, Dominion Energy
formed Blue Racer with Caiman to provide midstream services to natural gas producers operating in the Utica Shale region in Ohio and portions



of Pennsylvania. Blue Racer is an equal partnership between Dominion Energy and Caiman, with Dominion Energy contributing midstream assets and Caiman contributing private equity capital.
Midstream services offered by Blue Racer include gathering, processing, fractionation, and natural gas liquids transportation and marketing. Blue Racer is expected to develop additional new capacity designed to meet producer needs as the development
of the Utica Shale formation increases. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominion Energy’s equity method investment in Blue Racer.

Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment—Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas

Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ natural gas supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent
producers in the

Mid-Continent

and Gulf Coast regions, local producers in the Appalachian area, gas marketers and, for Questar Gas specifically, from Wexpro and other producers in the Rocky Mountain region.
Wexpro’s gas development and production operations serve the majority of Questar Gas’ gas supply requirements in accordance with the Wexpro Agreement and the Wexpro II Agreement, comprehensive agreements with the states of Utah and
Wyoming. Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ large underground natural gas storage network and the location of their pipeline systems are a significant link between the country’s major interstate gas pipelines and large markets
in the Northeast,

mid-Atlantic

and Rocky Mountain regions. Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ pipelines are part of an interconnected gas transmission system, which provides access to
supplies nationwide for local distribution companies, marketers, power generators and industrial and commercial customers.

Dominion
Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ underground storage facilities play an important part in balancing gas supply with consumer demand and are essential to serving the Northeast,

mid-Atlantic,

Midwest

EASONALITY

Gas Infrastructure Operating Segment—Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas

Gas Infrastructure’s natural gas distribution business earnings vary seasonally, as a result of the impact of changes in temperature on demand by
residential and commercial customers for gas to meet heating needs. Historically, the majority of these earnings have been generated during the heating season, which is generally from November to March; however, implementation of rate mechanisms in
Ohio for East Ohio, and Utah, Wyoming and Idaho for Questar Gas, have reduced the earnings impact of weather-related fluctuations. Demand for services at Dominion Energy’s gas transmission and storage business can also be weather sensitive.
Earnings are also impacted by changes in commodity prices driven by seasonal weather changes, the effects of unusual weather events on operations and the economy.

The earnings of Dominion Energy’s retail energy marketing operations also vary seasonally.
Generally, the demand for gas peaks during the winter months to meet heating needs.

Transportation.

State Regulations

E

LECTRIC

Virginia Power’s electric utility retail service is subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission.

Virginia Power holds CPCNs which authorize it to maintain and operate its electric facilities now in operation and to sell electricity to
customers. However, Virginia Power may not construct generating facilities or large capacity transmission lines without the prior approval of various state and federal government agencies. In addition, the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina
Commission regulate Virginia Power’s transactions with affiliates and transfers of certain facilities. The Virginia Commission also regulates the issuance of certain securities.

Electric Regulation in Virginia

The Regulation Act instituted a

cost-of-service

rate model, ending Virginia’s planned transition to retail competition for electric supply service to most classes of customers.

The Regulation Act authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation projects, FERC-approved
transmission costs, underground distribution lines, environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs, and also contains statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to file annual fuel cost
recovery cases with the Virginia Commission. As amended, it provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures on specific newly-proposed generation projects.



In February 2015, the Virginia Governor signed legislation into law which will keep Virginia
Power’s base rates unchanged until at least December 1, 2022. In addition, no biennial reviews will be conducted by the Virginia Commission for the five successive

12-month

test periods beginning
January 1, 2015, and ending December 31, 2019. The legislation states that Virginia Power’s 2015 biennial review, filed in March 2015, would proceed for the sole purpose of reviewing and determining whether any refunds are due to
customers based on earnings performance for generation and distribution services during the 2013 and 2014 test periods. In addition the legislation requires the Virginia Commission to conduct proceedings in 2017 and 2019 to determine the
utility’s ROE for use in connection with rate adjustment clauses and requires utilities to file integrated resource plans annually rather than biennially. In November 2017, the Virginia Commission approved an ROE of 9.2% for rate adjustment
clauses.

In February 2017, the Governor of Virginia signed legislation into law that allows utilities to file a rate adjustment clause to
recover costs of pumped hydroelectricity generation and storage facilities that are located in the coalfield region of Virginia. In March 2017, the Governor of Virginia signed legislation into law that allows utilities to file a rate adjustment
clause to recover, beginning in 2020, reasonably appropriate costs for extending the operating licenses, or the operating lives, of nuclear power generation facilities.

In March 2017, the Governor of Virginia signed legislation into law stating that it is in the public interest for utilities to replace
existing overhead tap lines having nine or more total unplanned outage

events-per-mile

with new underground facilities, and that utilities can seek cost recovery for
such new underground facilities through a rate adjustment clause.

If the Virginia Commission’s future rate decisions, including
actions relating to Virginia Power’s rate adjustment clause filings, differ materially from Virginia Power’s expectations, it may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Electric Regulation in North Carolina

Virginia Power’s retail electric base rates in North Carolina are regulated on a

cost-of-service/rate-of-return

basis subject to North Carolina statutes and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. North Carolina base
rates are set by a process that allows Virginia Power to recover its operating costs and an ROIC. If retail electric earnings exceed the authorized ROE established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review
and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Power’s future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis,
Virginia Power’s future earnings could be negatively impacted. Fuel rates are subject to revision under annual fuel cost adjustment proceedings.

Virginia Power’s transmission service rates in North Carolina are regulated by the North Carolina Commission as part of Virginia
Power’s bundled retail service to North Carolina customers.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

AS

Dominion Energy Questar’s natural gas development, production, transportation, and distribution services, including the rates it may charge its
customers, are regulated by the state commissions of Utah, Wyoming and Idaho. East Ohio’s natural gas distribution services, including the rates it may charge its customers, are regulated by the Ohio Commission. Hope’s natural gas
distribution services are regulated by the West Virginia Commission.

Gas Regulation in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho

Questar Gas is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the Utah, Wyoming and Idaho Commissions. The Idaho Commission has
contracted with the Utah Commission for rate oversight of Questar Gas’ operations in a small area of southeastern Idaho. When necessary, Questar Gas seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on
rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the

cost-of-service

by rate class. Base rates for Questar Gas are designed primarily based on rate design methodology
in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges.

In addition to general rate increases, Questar Gas
makes routine separate filings with the Utah and Wyoming Commissions to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas. The majority of these purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through the Wexpro Agreement and Wexpro II Agreement. Costs
that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The purchased gas recovery filings generally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Approved increases or decreases in gas cost recovery rates result in increases
or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses.

In connection with the Dominion
Energy Questar Combination, Questar Gas withdrew its general rate case filed in July 2016 with the Utah Commission and agreed not to file a general rate case with the Utah Commission to adjust its base distribution

non-gas

rates prior to July 2019, unless otherwise ordered by the Utah Commission. In addition Questar Gas agreed not to file a general rate case with the Wyoming Commission with a requested rate effective
date earlier than January 2020. This does not impact Questar Gas’ ability to adjust rates through various riders. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Gas Regulation in Ohio

East Ohio is subject to regulation of
rates and other aspects of its business by the Ohio Commission. When necessary, East Ohio seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the

cost-of-service

by rate class. A straight-fixed-variable rate design, in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through a monthly charge rather than a volumetric
charge, is utilized to establish rates for a majority of East Ohio’s customers pursuant to a 2008 rate case settlement.



In addition to general base rate increases, East Ohio makes routine filings with the Ohio
Commission to reflect changes in the costs of gas purchased for operational balancing on its system. These purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs.
Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The rider filings cover unrecovered gas costs plus prospective annual demand costs. Increases or decreases in gas cost rider rates result in increases or
decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses.

The Ohio Commission has also approved
several stand-alone cost recovery mechanisms to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure projects and certain other costs that vary widely over time; such costs are excluded from general base rates. See Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Gas Regulation in West Virginia

Hope is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the West Virginia Commission. When necessary, Hope seeks general base rate
increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the

cost-of-service

by rate class. Base rates for
Hope are designed primarily based on rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges.

In addition to general rate increases, Hope makes routine separate filings with the West Virginia Commission to reflect changes in the costs
of purchased gas. The majority of these purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as
regulatory assets. The purchased gas cost recovery filings generally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Approved increases or decreases in gas cost recovery rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or
decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses.

Legislation was passed in West Virginia authorizing a stand-alone cost recovery mechanism
to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure upgrades, replacements and expansions between general base rate cases. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Status of Competitive Retail Gas Services

The states of Ohio and
West Virginia, in which Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas have gas distribution operations, have considered legislation regarding a competitive deregulation of natural gas sales at the retail level.

Ohio

—Since October 2000, East Ohio has offered the Energy Choice program, under which residential and commercial customers are
encouraged to purchase gas directly from retail suppliers or through a community aggregation program. In October 2006, East Ohio restructured its commodity service by entering into gas purchase contracts with selected suppliers at a fixed price
above the New York Mercantile Exchange

month-end

settlement and passing that gas cost to customers under the Standard Service Offer program. Starting in April 2009, East Ohio buys natural gas under the
Standard Service Offer program only for customers not eligible to participate in the Energy Choice

program and places Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct retail relationship with selected suppliers, which is designated on the customers’ bills.

In January 2013, the Ohio Commission granted East Ohio’s motion to fully exit the merchant function for its nonresidential customers,
beginning in April 2013, which requires those customers to choose a retail supplier or be assigned to one at a monthly variable rate set by the supplier. At December 31, 2017, approximately 1.0 million of Dominion Energy Gas’
1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in the Energy Choice program. Subject to the Ohio Commission’s approval, East Ohio may eventually exit the gas merchant function in Ohio entirely and have all customers select an alternate gas
supplier. East Ohio continues to be the provider of last resort in the event of default by a supplier. Large industrial customers in Ohio also source their own natural gas supplies.

West Virginia

—At this time, West Virginia has not enacted legislation allowing customers to choose providers in the retail natural
gas markets served by Hope. However, the West Virginia Commission has issued regulations to govern pooling services, one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customers a choice in the future and has issued rules
requiring competitive gas service providers to be licensed in West Virginia.

OMMISSION

Electric

Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale
sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Virginia Power purchases and sells electricity in the PJM wholesale market and Dominion Energy’s merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM, MISO, CAISO and

ISO-NE

wholesale markets, and to wholesale purchasers in the states of Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana, Connecticut, Tennessee, Georgia, California, South Carolina and Utah, under Dominion Energy’s
market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC or pursuant to FERC authority to sell as a qualified facility. In addition, Virginia Power has FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded cost of generation.
This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Power’s service territory. Any such sales would be voluntary.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are subject to FERC’s Standards of Conduct that govern conduct between transmission function employees
of interstate gas and electricity transmission providers and the marketing function employees of their affiliates. The rule defines the scope of transmission and marketing-related functions that are covered by the standards and is designed to
prevent transmission providers from giving their affiliates undue preferences.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are also subject to
FERC’s affiliate restrictions that (1) prohibit power sales between Virginia Power and Dominion Energy’s merchant plants without first receiving FERC authorization, (2) require the merchant plants and Virginia Power to conduct
their wholesale power sales operations separately, and (3) prohibit Virginia Power from sharing market information with merchant plant operating personnel. The rules are designed to prohibit Virginia Power from giving the merchant plants a
competitive advantage.



EPACT included provisions to create an ERO. The ERO is required to promulgate mandatory
reliability standards governing the operation of the bulk power system in the U.S. FERC has certified NERC as the ERO and also issued an initial order approving many reliability standards that went into effect in 2007. Entities that violate
standards will be subject to fines of up to $1.2 million per day, per violation and can also be assessed

non-monetary

penalties, depending upon the nature and severity of the violation.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power plan and operate their facilities in compliance with approved NERC reliability requirements. Dominion
Energy and Virginia Power employees participate on various NERC committees, track the development and implementation of standards, and maintain proper compliance registration with NERC’s regional organizations. Dominion Energy and Virginia
Power anticipate incurring additional compliance expenditures over the next several years as a result of the implementation of new cybersecurity programs. In addition, NERC has redefined critical assets which expanded the number of assets subject to
NERC reliability standards, including cybersecurity assets. NERC continues to develop additional requirements specifically regarding supply chain standards and control centers that impact the bulk electric system. While Dominion Energy and Virginia
Power expect to incur additional compliance costs in connection with NERC requirements and initiatives, such expenses are not expected to significantly affect results of operations.

In April 2008, FERC granted an application for Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula
rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January 1, 2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated
based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure.

Gas

FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of
natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over rates, terms and conditions of services performed by Dominion Energy Questar
Pipeline, DETI, DECG, Iroquois and certain services performed by Cove Point. The design, construction and operation of Cove Point’s LNG facility, including associated natural gas pipelines, the Liquefaction Project and the import and export of
LNG are also regulated by FERC.

Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ interstate gas transmission and storage activities
are conducted on an open access basis, in accordance with certificates, tariffs and service agreements on file with FERC and FERC regulations.

Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas operate in compliance with FERC standards of conduct, which prohibit the sharing of certain

non-public

transmission information or customer specific data by its interstate gas transmission and storage companies with

non-transmission

function employees. Pursuant to
these standards of conduct, Dominion Energy and

Dominion Energy Gas also make certain informational postings available on Dominion Energy’s website.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Safety Regulations

Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas are
also subject to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, which mandate inspections of interstate and intrastate natural gas transmission and storage pipelines,
particularly those located in areas of high-density population. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas have evaluated their natural gas transmission and storage properties, as required by the Department of Transportation regulations under these
Acts, and has implemented a program of identification, testing and potential remediation activities. These activities are ongoing.

The
Companies are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. The Companies have an
internal safety, health and security program designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements, which is routinely reviewed and considered for improvement. The Companies believe that they are in material compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations related to worker health and safety. Notwithstanding these preventive measures, incidents may occur that are outside of the Companies’ control.

Environmental Regulations

Each of the Companies’ operating
segments faces substantial laws, regulations and compliance costs with respect to environmental matters. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for
noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the Companies. If compliance expenditures and associated operating
costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated rates (in regulated businesses) or market prices (in unregulated businesses), those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows. The Companies have applied for
or obtained the necessary environmental permits for the construction and operation of their facilities. Many of these permits are subject to reissuance and continuing review. For a discussion of significant aspects of these matters, including
current and planned capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance required to be discussed in this Item, see

ESA, MBTA and BGEPA. The ESA and BGEPA require potentially lengthy coordination with the state and federal agencies to ensure potentially affected species are protected. Ultimately, the suite of species protections may restrict company activities to
certain times of year, project modifications may be necessary to avoid harm, or a permit may be needed to allow for unavoidable taking of the species. The authorizing agency may impose mitigation requirements and costs to compensate for harm of a
protected species or habitat loss. These requirements and time of year restrictions can result in adverse impacts on project plans and schedules such that the Companies’ businesses may be materially affected.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

All aspects of the operation and
maintenance of Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear power stations are regulated by the NRC. Operating licenses issued by the NRC are subject to revocation, suspension or modification, and the operation of a nuclear unit may be
suspended if the NRC determines that the public interest, health or safety so requires.

From time to time, the NRC adopts new
requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. In many cases, these new regulations require changes in the design, operation and maintenance of existing nuclear facilities. If the NRC adopts such requirements in the future, it
could result in substantial increases in the cost of operating and maintaining Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear generating units. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The NRC also requires Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to decontaminate their nuclear facilities once operations cease.



This process is referred to as decommissioning, and Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are required by the NRC to be financially prepared. For information on decommissioning trusts, see

TRATEGY

As
part of the Companies’ overall long term strategic planning overseen by the Board of Directors, we have a well formed environmental strategy. The Companies are committed to continuing to be an industry leader, delivering safe, reliable, clean
and affordable energy while fully complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, we seek to build partnerships and engage with local communities, stakeholders and customers on environmental issues important to them.
The Companies are dedicated to meeting their customers’ growing energy needs with innovative, sustainable solutions. It is the Companies’ belief that sustainable solutions should strive to balance the interdependent goals of environmental
stewardship and economic effects. The integrated strategy to meet these objectives consists of three major elements:

•

Reduction of GHG emissions;

•

Energy infrastructure modernization, including natural gas and electric operations; and

•

Conservation and energy efficiency.

Reduction of GHG Emissions

The Companies integrated strategy has resulted in a reduction in GHG emission intensity. Over the past two decades, the Companies have made changes to the
generation mix and to natural gas operations which have significantly improved environmental performance. For example, Power Generation has significantly reduced both its carbon emissions and its carbon intensity while generating electricity with an
increasingly clean portfolio. From 2000 through 2016, our carbon intensity decreased by 43%. This strategy has also resulted in significant reductions of other air pollutants such as NO

X

, SO


and mercury and also reduced the amount of coal ash generated and the amount of water withdrawn. The principal components of the strategy, which include initiatives that address electric energy
production and delivery, natural gas storage, transmission and delivery and energy management, are as follows:

•

Expand Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s renewable energy portfolio, including solar, wind power, and biomass, to further diversify Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s fleet, meet state
renewable energy targets and lower the carbon footprint;

•

Pursue the extension of operating licenses of existing nuclear units which provide carbon-free generation;

•

Evaluate effective battery solutions, such as hydroelectric pumped storage, which help support a grid with increased renewables;

•

Enhance conservation and energy efficiency programs on both the electric and gas side of our businesses to help customers use energy wisely and reduce environmental impacts;

•

Sell, close, place in cold reserve or convert to cleaner fuels a number of coal-fired generation units owned by Dominion Energy and Virginia Power;

•

Evaluate behind-the-meter and rate design solutions and other business opportunities;

•

Construct new electric and gas transmission infrastructure to modernize the grid, to expand availability of cleaner fuel, to reduce emissions, to promote energy and economic security and help deliver more green energy
to population centers where it is needed most;

•

Replace older distribution pipeline mains and services; and

•

Implement and enhance voluntary methane mitigation measures through participation in the EPA’s Natural Gas Star and Methane Challenge programs; and continue to evaluate business opportunities presented by a lower
carbon economy and innovative technologies.

ENERATION

Renewable energy is an important component of a diverse and reliable energy mix that helps to mitigate the environmental aspects of energy production.
Nationally, Dominion Energy has nearly 2,400 MW of renewable generating capacity in operation or under development in nine states, including offtake agreements for Virginia Power’s utility customers. Both Virginia and North Carolina have passed
legislation setting targets for renewable power. Dominion Energy is committed to meeting Virginia’s goals of 12% of base year electric energy sales from renewable power sources by 2022, and 15% by 2025, and North Carolina’s Renewable
Portfolio Standard of 12.5% by 2021 and continues to add utility-scale solar capacity. Backed by a $1 billion investment, Dominion Energy has grown its solar fleet in Virginia and North Carolina over the past two years from near zero to about
1,350 megawatts in service, in construction or under development.

See

Operating Segments

and Item 2. Properties for additional
information, including Dominion Energy’s merchant solar properties.

GHG E

MISSIONS

Since 2000, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have tracked the emissions of their electric generation fleet, which employs a mix of fuel and renewable energy
sources. Comparing annual year 2016 to annual year 2000, the entire electric generating fleet (based on ownership percentage) reduced its average CO


emissions rate per MWh of energy produced
from electric generation by approximately 43%. Comparing annual year 2016 to annual year 2000, the regulated electric generating fleet (based on ownership percentage) reduced its average CO


emissions rate per MWh of energy produced from electric generation by approximately 26%.

Dominion Energy also develops a comprehensive
GHG inventory annually. For Power Generation, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s direct CO


equivalent emissions, based on ownership percentage, were 37.2 million metric tons and
33.1 million metric tons, respectively, in 2016, compared to 34.3 million metric tons and 30.9 million metric tons, respectively, in 2015. The corresponding carbon intensity rates for Dominion Energy were 0.339 metric tons CO


equivalent



emissions per net MWh in 2016 and 0.348 metric tons CO


equivalent emissions per net MWh in 2015.

For Power Delivery’s regulated electric transmission and distribution operations, direct CO


equivalent emissions for 2016 were 42,856 metric tons, compared to 53,819 metric tons in 2015.

Dominion Energy’s natural gas companies have been reporting GHG emissions to the EPA since 2011 under the GHG Reporting Program. In
January 2016, the GHG Reporting Program was expanded to also include GHG inputs and emissions associated with natural gas gathering and boosting sources and transmission pipeline blowdowns for facilities that exceed 25,000 metric tons per year of CO


equivalent emissions. The sources within these new facilities were not previously covered under the rule and the first reports for these new sources were submitted to EPA on March 31, 2017.

Hope and East Ohio direct CO


equivalent emissions together decreased from
0.90 million metric tons in 2015 to 0.86 million metric tons in 2016. DETI’s and Cove Point’s direct CO


equivalent emissions together were 1.3 million metric tons in
2016, increasing from 1.1 million metric tons in 2015 attributable to new EPA reporting of transmission pipeline blowdowns.

The
Companies’ GHG inventory follows all methodologies specified in the EPA Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 98 for calculating emissions. Total CO


equivalent emissions reported for our natural gas assets, as estimated in Dominion Energy’s corporate inventory, were 2.3 million metric tons in 2016. This estimate includes emissions reported under the GHG Reporting Program, as well as
other emissions not required to be reported under the federal program. The 2016 corporate GHG inventory emission estimate includes Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline, Questar Gas and Wexpro for the entire calendar year.

Energy Infrastructure Modernization

Dominion Energy’s
existing five-year investment plan includes significant capital expenditures to upgrade or add new electric transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory,
maintain reliability, implement a strategic underground program to minimize outage duration and address environmental requirements. These enhancements are primarily aimed at meeting Dominion Energy’s continued goal of providing reliable
service, and are intended to address both continued population growth and increases in electricity consumption. An additional benefit will be added capacity to efficiently deliver electricity from the renewable projects now being developed, or to be
developed in the future, to meet our customers’ preference for cleaner energy. See

Operating Segments

for additional information.

The Companies have also implemented infrastructure improvements and improved operational practices to reduce the GHG emissions from our
natural gas facilities. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas, in connection with their existing five-year investment plans, are also pursuing the construction or upgrade of regulated infrastructure in their natural gas businesses. The Companies
have made voluntary commitments as part of the EPA Methane Challenge Program to continue to reduce methane emissions as part of these improvements. See

Operating Segments

for additional information, including natural gas infrastructure projects.

Conservation and Energy
Efficiency

Conservation and load management play a significant role in meeting the growing demand for electricity and natural gas, while also helping
to reduce the environmental footprint of our customers.

The Regulation Act provides incentives for energy conservation through the
implementation of conservation programs. Additional legislation in 2009 added definitions of peak-shaving and energy efficiency programs, and allowed for a margin on operating expenses and recovery of revenue reductions related to energy efficiency
programs.

Virginia Power’s DSM programs, implemented with Virginia Commission and North Carolina Commission approval, provide
important incremental steps in assisting customers to reduce energy consumption through programs that include energy audits and incentives for customers to upgrade or install certain energy efficient measures and/or systems. The DSM programs began
in Virginia in 2010 and in North Carolina in 2011. Currently, there are residential and

non-residential

DSM programs active in the two states. Virginia Power continues to evaluate opportunities to redesign
current DSM programs and develop new DSM initiatives in Virginia and North Carolina.

Virginia Power continues to upgrade meters
throughout Virginia to AMI, also referred to as smart meters. The AMI meter upgrades are part of an ongoing demonstration effort to help Virginia Power further evaluate the effectiveness of AMI meters to monitor voltage stability, remotely turn off
and on electric service, increase detection and reporting capabilities with respect to power outages and restorations, obtain remote daily meter readings and offer dynamic rates.

East Ohio offers two DSM programs, approved by the Ohio Commission, designed to help customers reduce their energy consumption. One program
provides weatherization assistance to help income-eligible customers reduce their energy usage. Another program has been designed to help East Ohio’s residential customers improve their homes’ energy efficiency, starting with a home energy
assessment. Following the assessment, customers receive a report with recommendations on how to save energy and improve their home’s comfort. This program includes rebates and free installation of several energy-efficient products such as,
high-efficiency showerheads, kitchen and bathroom faucet aerators, programmable thermostat or carbon monoxide detector and water heater pipe wrap.

Questar Gas offers an energy-efficiency program, approved by the Utah and Wyoming Commissions, designed to help customers reduce their energy
consumption. This program promotes the use of energy-efficient appliances and practices to reduce natural gas usage. The program provides home energy planning, which provides homeowners with a

step-by-step

roadmap to efficiency improvements to reduce gas usage. In addition to the recommendations, the program provides home owners with energy-saving devices such as pipe insulation and

low-flow

shower heads as well as rebates on appliances and weatherization items. The program also offers new construction builders with rebates for installing high-efficiency equipment and offers commercial
businesses with rebates on energy efficient equipment and retrofits.

YBERSECURITY

In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, the Companies have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and
preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. In addition, the Companies are subject to mandatory cybersecurity regulatory requirements, interface regularly with a wide range of external organizations, and participate
in classified briefings to maintain an awareness of current cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. The Companies’ current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts are intended to address the evolving and changing cyber threats.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The
Companies’ businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For
other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see

Forward-Looking Statements

in Item 7. MD&A.

The Companies’ results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather.

Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the
Companies’ services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas transmission and distribution services. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other
natural disasters can disrupt operation of the Companies’ facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels
or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies’ power stations. Furthermore, the Companies’ operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage
should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations
located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.

The rates of Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy
Gas’ gas transmission and distribution operations and Virginia Power’s electric transmission, distribution and generation operations are subject to regulatory review.

Revenue provided by Virginia Power’s electric transmission,
distribution and generation operations and Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. However, certain large scale
customers are able to enter into negotiated-rate contracts rather than pay

cost-of-service

rates which are subject to regulatory review. The profitability of these
businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.

Virginia Power’s wholesale rates for electric transmission service are updated on an
annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia Power’s wholesale rates for electric transmission reflect the estimated

cost-of-service

for each calendar year. The difference in the estimated

cost-of-service

and actual

cost-of-service

for each calendar year is included as an adjustment to the wholesale rates for electric transmission service in a subsequent calendar year.
These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Power’s wholesale revenue
requirement is no longer just and reasonable. They are also subject to retroactive corrections to the extent that the formula rate was not properly populated with the actual costs.

Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ gas transmission businesses are subject
to review by FERC. In addition, the rates of Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate. A failure by Dominion Energy or Dominion
Energy Gas to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Virginia Power’s base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the
Virginia Commission on a biennial basis in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Power’s actual earned ROE during a combined

two-year

historic test period, and the determination of
Virginia Power’s authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to share a portion of its earnings with customers through a refund process.

Legislation signed by the Virginia Governor in February 2015 suspends biennial reviews for the five successive

12-month

test periods beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019, and no changes will be made to Virginia Power’s existing base rates until at least December 1, 2022. During
this period, Virginia Power bears the risk of any severe weather events and natural disasters, the risk of asset impairments related to the early retirement of any generation facilities due to the implementation of environmental regulations, as well
as an increase in general operating and financing costs, and Virginia Power may not recover its associated costs through increases to base rates. If Virginia Power incurs any such significant additional expenses during this period, Virginia Power
may not be able to recover its costs and/or earn a reasonable return on capital investment, which could negatively affect Virginia Power’s future earnings.

Virginia Power’s retail electric base rates for bundled generation, transmission, and distribution services to customers in North
Carolina are regulated on a

cost-of-service/rate-of-return

basis subject to North
Carolina statutes, and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. If retail electric earnings exceed the returns established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by
the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Power’s future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery through



base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, Virginia Power’s future earnings could be negatively impacted.

Governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge these regulatory reviews. Such challenges may lengthen the time,
complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews.

The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, including
tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties.

The Companies’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits,
approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assets and
pipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes
that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies’ businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial
monetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or
regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for

non-compliance

with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Recent legislative and
regulatory changes that are impacting the Companies include the 2017 Tax Reform Act and tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the U.S. government in 2018.

The

2017 Tax Reform Act

could have a material impact on our operations, cash flows, and financial results.

Reductions in the estimated annual cost-of-service effect (commonly referred to as the

gross-up

factor) due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rates to 21% under the provisions of the 2017 Tax
Reform Act could result in amounts currently collected from utility customers to be refundable to such customers, generally through reductions in rates. In addition, the Companies’ regulators may require the reduction in accumulated deferred
income tax balances under the provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act to be shared with customers, generally through reductions in future rates. The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passed
back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential refunds of other deferred taxes may be determined by our federal and state regulators.

The

2017 Tax Reform Act

could have a material impact on Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’
FERC-regulated

gas

operations including rates charged to customers.

In light of the reduction in the income tax rate in the 2017 Tax Reform Act, our FERC-regulated gas subsidiaries are subject to an increased risk of FERC
initiating industry-wide proceedings under Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act to have interstate pipelines substantiate rates charged for transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, when viewed holistically, are “just
and reasonable” taking into account the effects of tax reform and all other drivers. It is unclear if FERC will mandate a

one-time

rate reset or Section 5 rate case for Dominion Energy and Dominion

Energy Gas’ regulated subsidiaries; however, states as well as customers have petitioned FERC to request changes in rates as a result of tax reform.

The interpretation of provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act that take effect in 2018 may significantly impact our operations.

The 2017
Tax Reform Act contains provisions that limit the deductibility of interest expense. The new provision generally limits the interest deduction on business interest to (1) business interest income, plus (2) 30 percent of the taxpayer’s
adjusted taxable income. Business interest and business interest income is defined as that allocable to a trade or business and not investment interest and income. Regulated public utilities are not subject to this interest limitation; however
Dominion Energy is a consolidated group with both regulated and merchant lines of businesses. The U.S. Department of Treasury has been tasked with providing guidance on applying the interest limitation to consolidated groups, such as Dominion
Energy, but it is unclear when that guidance may be issued, or whether that guidance could result in a disallowance of a portion of our interest deductions in the future.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could

change
market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing

rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services
into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets
depend upon FERC’s continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominion Energy’s authority to sell at
market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, Dominion Energy or Virginia Power’s authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules
involving revenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of Dominion Energy or Virginia Power’s generation business. For example, in July 2015, FERC approved changes to PJM’s Reliability Pricing Model capacity market
establishing a new Capacity Performance Resource product. This product offers the potential for higher capacity prices but can also impose significant economic penalties on generator owners such as Virginia Power for failure to perform during
periods when electricity is in high demand. In addition, there have been changes to the interpretation and application of FERC’s market manipulation rules. A failure to comply with these rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties.

The Companies’ infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval before construction can commence. The
Companies may not complete facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated, and they

may not be
able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed.

Several facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects have been announced and additional projects



may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencing
construction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed on
time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of
counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond the Companies’ control. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the
projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations.

Start-up

and operational issues can arise in
connection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities, including but not limited to commencement of commercial operations at our power generation facilities following expansions and the Liquefaction Project. Such issues
may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations
and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors
could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects.

The development, construction and commissioning of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant
execution risk.

The Companies are currently simultaneously developing, constructing or commissioning several major projects, including the Liquefaction Project, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, the Supply Header project, Greensville County
and multiple DETI projects, which together help contribute to the over $25 billion in capital expenditures planned by the Companies through 2022. Several of the Companies’ key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being
constructed in constrained geographic areas or in difficult terrain, for example, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project. The advancement of the Companies’ ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of
stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural

gas-related

and energy infrastructure projects. For example, certain landowners and stakeholder groups oppose the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project,
which could impede construction activities or the acquisition of

rights-of-way

and other land rights on a timely basis or on acceptable terms. Given that these projects
provide the foundation for the Companies’ strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to
budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies’

financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, while Dominion Energy has received the required approvals to commence construction of the Liquefaction Project from the DOE,
all DOE export licenses are subject to review and possible withdrawal should the DOE conclude that such export authorization is no longer in the public interest. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any
future litigation could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to execute their business plan.

The Companies are dependent on their
contractors for the successful and timely completion of large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult terrain and could
be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies’ financial performance and/or impair the Companies’
ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled.

Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide
liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms could negatively affect the Companies’ financial condition, cash flows, the projects’ anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for
the projects as scheduled.

The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to a number of environmental laws
and regulations which impose significant compliance costs to the Companies.

The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to
air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring,
installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they
have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certain
facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future.

We expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted including regulation of GHG emissions
which could have an impact on the Companies’ business. Risks relating to expected regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed below. In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHG
emissions under the CAA have been imposed on the natural gas sector, including rules to limit methane leakage. The Companies are also subject to federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures,
coal combustion

by-product

handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations, management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and the potential further
regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls.



Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the
requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating

clean-up

costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies’
facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.

Any additional federal and/or state requirements imposed on energy companies mandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency
improvements may result in compliance

costs that alone or in combination could make some of the Companies’ electric generation units or natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate.

The Clean Power Plan, targeted at
reducing CO


emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power generation facilities, has been stayed and is being reviewed by the EPA. Compliance with a replacement rule for the Clean Power
Plan, or similar regulations, are expected to require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon reduction programs, purchase of allowances and/or emission rate credits, fuel switching,
and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities. In the absence of federal legislation, states are also contemplating regulations regarding GHG emissions. For example, the
Virginia General Assembly has considered legislation which would authorize the state to directly join the RGGI program as a full participant. Given these developments and uncertainties, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power cannot estimate the
aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if material, could make Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s generation facilities uneconomical to
operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominion Energy’s or Virginia Power’s results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.

There are also potential impacts on Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ natural gas businesses as federal or state GHG
regulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector which, in addition to resulting in increased costs, could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy
conservation and renewable products, which could impact the natural gas businesses.

Virginia Power is subject to risks associated with
the disposal and storage of coal ash.

Virginia Power historically produced and continues to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a

by-product

of its coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed
in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at eight different facilities.

Virginia Power is facing litigation regarding alleged
CWA violations at Chesapeake power station, and may face litigation concerning its coal ash facilities at other stations. Depending on the final outcome of any such litigation, Virginia Power could incur expenses and other costs, including costs
associated with

closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs, which Virginia has adopted.
These CCR regulations require Virginia Power to make additional capital expenditures and increase its operating and maintenance expenses.

Further, while Virginia Power operates its ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release of coal
ash with a significant environmental impact, such as the Dan River ash basin release by a neighboring utility, could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, and
reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of Virginia Power.

The Companies’ operations are subject to
operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies.

Operation of the Companies’ facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure
of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns,
shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. The Companies’ businesses are dependent
upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies’ transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities
are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.

Operation of the Companies’ facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including
higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies’ facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies’ business.
Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies’ operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost
units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or
liability for damages could result.

In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies’ operations and the
transportation, storage and processing of natural gas and NGLs, including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party
equipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or
business interruptions and associated public or



employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of pipelines and storage facilities, or generation,
transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may
incur substantial costs and liabilities.

Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the

on-site

storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and
extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance
coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If Dominion
Energy’s and Virginia Power’s decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance, or in the case of Virginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, their results
of operations could be negatively impacted.

Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear facilities are also subject to
complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the
event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is
achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious
nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in
Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units.

Sustained declines in natural gas and NGL prices have resulted in, and could result in further, curtailments of third-party producers’
drilling programs, delaying the production of volumes of natural gas and NGLs that Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas gather, process, and transport and reducing the value of NGLs retained by Dominion Energy Gas, which may adversely affect
Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ revenues and earnings.

Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas obtain their supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Most producers are under no obligation to deliver a
specific quantity of natural gas or

NGLs to Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ facilities. A number of other factors could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs available to Dominion Energy’s and
Dominion Energy Gas’ pipelines and other assets. Increased regulation of energy extraction activities could result in reductions in drilling for new natural gas wells, which could decrease the volumes of natural gas supplied to Dominion Energy
and Dominion Energy Gas. Producers with direct commodity price exposure face liquidity constraints, which could present a credit risk to Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas. Producers could shift their production activities to regions outside
Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ footprint. In addition, the extent of natural gas reserves and the rate of production from such reserves may be less than anticipated. If producers were to decrease the supply of natural gas or
NGLs to Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas could experience lower revenues to the extent they are unable to replace the lost volumes on similar terms.
In addition, Dominion Energy Gas’ revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at market prices. Dominion Energy Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain the
extracted NGLs as compensation for its services. This exposes Dominion Energy Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between the NGL products and natural gas, and relative changes in these prices could adversely impact Dominion
Energy Gas’ results.

Dominion Energy’s merchant power business operates in a challenging market, which could adversely
affect its results of operations

and future growth.

The success of Dominion Energy’s merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating
costs. Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion Energy attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedging
transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.

In these wholesale markets, the spot market
price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that
consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas
generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion Energy does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect
its financial results.

Dominion Energy purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot
market purchases. Dominion Energy is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price
that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominion Energy’s financial results.



In addition, in the event that any of the merchant generation facilities experience a forced
outage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated.

The Companies’ financial results can be adversely
affected by various factors driving supply and demand for electricity and gas and

related services.

Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in

end-use

devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to
reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Further, Virginia Power’s business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in
distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services. Virginia
Power has an exclusive franchise to serve retail electric customers in Virginia. However, Virginia’s Retail Access Statutes allow certain Power Generation customers exceptions to this franchise. As market conditions change, Virginia
Power’s customers may further pursue exceptions and Virginia Power’s exclusive franchise may erode.

Reduced energy demand or
significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offset
through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies’ business activities.

Dominion Energy Gas has
experienced a decline in demand for certain of its processing services due to competing facilities operating in nearby areas.

Dominion
Energy and Dominion Energy Gas may not be able to maintain, renew or replace their existing portfolio of customer contracts successfully,

or on favorable terms.

Upon contract expiration, customers may not elect to

re-contract

with Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas as a result of a variety of factors, including the amount of competition in the industry, changes in the price of natural gas, their level of satisfaction
with Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ services, the extent to which Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas are able to successfully execute their business plans and the effect of the regulatory framework on customer demand. The
failure to replace any such customer contracts on similar terms could result in a loss of revenue for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas and related decreases in their earnings and cash flows.

Certain of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price “negotiated
rate” contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to

perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.

Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to
sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased
costs which could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being

used to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as a result of these “negotiated rate” contracts could decrease Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ earnings and cash
flows.

Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results of operations.

The
Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Some of Dominion
Energy’s operations are conducted through less than wholly-owned subsidiaries. In such arrangements, Dominion Energy is dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures. Counterparties could fail or delay the
performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, financial institutions or
other third parties may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results.

Dominion Energy will also be exposed to counterparty
credit risk relating to the terminal services agreements for the Liquefaction Project. While the counterparties’ obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either agreement resulting in a judgment in Dominion Energy’s favor, Dominion Energy may need to seek to enforce a final
U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process.

liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to
satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear plants and under Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Companies have significant
obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates.

With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the
obligations to decommission Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear plants or require additional

NRC-approved

funding assurance.

A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy
Gas’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ pension
and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions,
may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.



If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market
fluctuations or other factors, the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected.

The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints.

The Companies use derivative instruments,
including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, currency and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas purchase and sell commodity-based contracts for hedging purposes.

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes
provisions that will require certain

over-the-counter

derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform.

Non-financial

entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange trading
requirements. Final rules for the

over-the-counter

derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be established through the ongoing rulemaking
process of the applicable regulators, including rules regarding margin requirements for

non-cleared

swaps. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, the Companies’ derivative activities are
not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. In addition, changes to or the elimination of
rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies’ counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies’ derivative activities.

Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies’ growth and business strategy.

In order to maintain
appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect
their growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies’ credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies to
post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.

An inability to access financial markets
could adversely affect the execution of the Companies’ business plans.

The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans with
increasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies’ creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit
rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies’ control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict
their ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or political
events, or

the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies’ ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their
ability to execute their business plans as scheduled.

Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect the
Companies’ financial results.

The Companies cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting
standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect earnings or could increase liabilities.

War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies’ operations.

The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies’ business in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign may affect
the Companies’ operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, the Companies’ infrastructure facilities, including projects under construction, could be
direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. For example, a physical attack on a critical substation in California resulted in serious impacts to the power grid. Furthermore, the physical compromise of the Companies’
facilities could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result
in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of insurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companies’ results of operations and financial condition.

Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies’ operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential

information,
damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies’ business.

The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.
Further, the computer systems that run the Companies’ facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state
actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies’ computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example,
malware has been designed to target software that runs the nation’s critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies’ businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintain
sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.

A
successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies’ electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or
collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies’ ability to correctly record, process and report
finan-



cial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial
action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies’ reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach
notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. The Companies maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents; however, other damage and claims arising from such
incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations.

Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on the
Companies’ operations.

The Companies’ business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies’ key executive officers are the CEO, CFO and presidents and those responsible for
financial, operational, legal, regulatory and accounting functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies’ business operations is high. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or
complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the length of time required for skill development. In this
case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and
expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Companies’ business. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companies’
technical employees for transmission, generation and distribution operations. The Companies’ inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results.

The completion of the merger with SCANA is subject to the receipt of consents, approvals and/or findings from governmental entities, which
may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Dominion Energy or SCANA or could cause either Dominion Energy or SCANA to abandon the merger. The completion of the merger is also subject to there not having been substantive changes in
certain South Carolina laws that have or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on SCANA or its subsidiaries or orders of governmental entities or changes in law that impose any condition that would reasonably be expected to result
in specified changes to the South Carolina Commission petition.

Dominion Energy and SCANA are not required to complete the merger until after the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act expires or terminates and
the requisite authorizations, approvals, consents and/or permits are received from the FERC, NRC, South Carolina Commission, North Carolina Commission and Georgia Public Service Commission. Any of the relevant governmental entities may oppose the
merger, fail to approve the

merger, fail to make required findings in favor of the merger, or impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their consent, approval or findings or in connection with their
review. Regulatory approvals of the merger or findings with respect to the merger may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all, and such approvals or findings may include conditions that could have an adverse effect on Dominion Energy and/or
SCANA, or result in the abandonment of the merger. Dominion Energy cannot provide any assurance that Dominion Energy and SCANA will obtain the necessary approvals or findings or that any required conditions will not have an adverse effect on
Dominion Energy following the merger.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger agreement may
require Dominion Energy to accept conditions from regulators that could adversely impact Dominion Energy after the merger without either of Dominion Energy or SCANA having the right to refuse to close the merger on the basis of those regulatory
conditions, except that Dominion Energy is generally not required, and SCANA is generally not permitted without Dominion Energy’s prior approval, to take any action or accept any condition that results in a burdensome condition for Dominion
Energy or SCANA as more fully described in the SCANA Merger Agreement.

In addition, the SCANA Merger Agreement provides that Dominion
Energy (but not SCANA) will have the right to refuse to complete the merger if, since the date of the SCANA Merger Agreement, any governmental entity shall have enacted any order, or there shall have been any change in law (including the Base Load
Review Act and the other laws governing South Carolina public utilities), which imposes any material change to the terms, conditions or undertakings set forth in the South Carolina Commission petition, or any significant changes to the economic
value of the proposed terms set forth in the South Carolina Commission petition, in each case as determined by Dominion Energy in good faith.

The SCANA Merger Agreement further provides that Dominion Energy will have the right to refuse to close the merger if there shall have
occurred any substantive change in the Base Load Review Act or other laws governing South Carolina public utilities which has or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on SCANA or any of its subsidiaries. There is currently pending
before the South Carolina Senate a bill that would make substantive changes to the Base Load Review Act. This bill has passed the South Carolina House of Representatives. If this bill becomes law, Dominion Energy would not be obligated to complete
the merger if it is determined that the bill has or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on SCANA or any of its subsidiaries.

Certain lawsuits and regulatory actions have been filed against SCANA and SCE&G in connection with the abandonment of the V.C. Summer
Units 2 and 3 new nuclear development project. If the relief requested in these matters (including a request for declaratory judgment that the Base Load Review Act is unconstitutional) is granted, Dominion Energy might not be obligated to complete
the merger.

Dominion Energy and SCANA can provide no assurance that these risks will not materialize and either adversely impact Dominion
Energy after the completion of the merger or, if such conditions rise to the thresholds discussed above, some of which,



as described above, are in the subjective determination of Dominion Energy acting in good faith, or if the required authorizations, approvals, consents and/or permits are not obtained or
received, result in the abandonment of the merger.

Dominion Energy expects to incur substantial expenses related to the merger with
SCANA.

Dominion Energy expects to incur relatively significant expenses in connection with completing the merger. While Dominion Energy has assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred,
there are a number of factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of its integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time.

Following the merger with SCANA, Dominion Energy may be unable to successfully integrate SCANA’s businesses.

Dominion Energy
and SCANA currently operate as independent public companies. After the merger, Dominion Energy will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating SCANA’s business. Potential difficulties Dominion Energy may
encounter in the integration process include the following:

•

The complexities associated with integrating SCANA and its utility businesses, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services;

•

The complexities of integrating a company with different core services, markets and customers;

•

The inability to attract and retain key employees;

•

Potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger;

•

Difficulties in managing political and regulatory conditions related to SCANA’s utility businesses after the merger;

•

The cost recovery plan includes a moratorium on filing requests for adjustments in SCE&G’s base electric rates until 2021 if the merger is approved by the South Carolina Commission, which would limit Dominion
Energy’s ability to recover increases in non-fuel related costs of electric operations for SCE&G’s customers; and

•

Performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of Dominion Energy management’s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating SCANA’s utility businesses.

For these reasons, it is possible that the integration process following the merger could result in the distraction of Dominion Energy’s
management, the disruption of Dominion Energy’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of Dominion Energy to maintain or establish
relationships with current and prospective customers, vendors and employees or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of Dominion Energy.

Dominion Energy and SCANA may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity related to the merger and in connection with other
related matters, including the abandonment of the V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 new nuclear development project.

From time to time, political and public sentiment in connection with the merger and in connection with other matters,
including the abandonment of the V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 new nuclear development project may result in a significant

amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting Dominion Energy and SCANA. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political
or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, as well as
responding to and addressing adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements, can divert the time and effort of senior management from the management of Dominion Energy’s and SCANA’s respective businesses.

Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and,
regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of Dominion Energy and SCANA, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators,
customers and commercial counterparties. It may also have a negative impact on their ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding
to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on Dominion Energy’s and SCANA’s respective business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The market value of Dominion Energy common stock could decline if large amounts of its common stock are sold following the merger with
SCANA.

Following the merger, shareholders of Dominion Energy and former SCANA shareholders will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. Current
shareholders of Dominion Energy and SCANA may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company, or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company, in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines, to increase
diversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which Dominion Energy common stock or SCANA common stock is or was included. If, following the merger, large amounts of Dominion Energy common stock are sold, the price of its common
stock could decline.

The merger with SCANA may not be accretive to operating earnings and may cause dilution to Dominion Energy’s
earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Dominion Energy common stock.

Dominion Energy currently anticipates that the merger will be immediately accretive to Dominion Energy’s forecasted operating
earnings per share on a standalone basis. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates, which may materially change. Dominion Energy may encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs, may fail to realize all of the benefits
anticipated in the merger or be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates or its ability to realize operational efficiencies. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in Dominion Energy’s operating earnings per share or
decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of Dominion Energy’s common stock. Dominion Energy expects the initial effect of the merger on its GAAP earnings will be a decrease in such
earnings due to the anticipated charges for refunds to SCE&G customers, write-offs of regulatory assets and transaction costs.



Litigation against SCANA and Dominion Energy could result in an injunction preventing the
completion of the merger with SCANA or may adversely affect the combined company’s business, financial condition or results of operations following the merger with SCANA.

Following the announcement of the SCANA Merger
Agreement, lawsuits have been filed asserting claims relating to the merger. Among other things, the lawsuits allege breaches of various fiduciary duties by the members of the SCANA board in connection with the merger and allegations that Dominion
Energy and/or SCANA aided and abetted such alleged breaches. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the merger, rescind the merger agreement or be awarded monetary damages should the merger be completed. While Dominion Energy believes
that dismissal of these lawsuits is warranted, the outcome of any such litigation is inherently uncertain. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or any claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger closes may adversely affect the combined
company’s business, financial condition or results of operation. Additionally, other lawsuits may be filed in the future making similar or new claims and seeking similar or new remedies.

D

ominion Energy has goodwill and other intangible assets on its balance sheet, and these amounts will increase as a result of the
merger with SCANA. If its goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, Dominion Energy may be required to record a significant, non-cash charge to earnings and reduce its shareholders’ equity.

Upon the completion of
the merger, Dominion Energy will record as goodwill the excess of the purchase price paid by Dominion Energy over the fair value of SCANA’s assets and liabilities as determined for financial accounting purposes. Under GAAP, intangible assets
are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. If Dominion Energy’s intangible assets, including goodwill as a result of the merger,
are determined to be impaired in the future, Dominion Energy may be required to record a significant, non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined.

From time to time, the Companies are alleged to be in violation or in default under orders, statutes, rules or regulations relating to the environment,
compliance plans imposed upon or agreed to by the Companies, or permits issued by various local, state and/or federal agencies for the construction or operation of facilities. Administrative proceedings may also be pending on these matters. In
addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Companies and their subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings.

In January
2016, Virginia Power self-reported a release of mineral oil from the Crystal City substation and began extensive cleanup. Virginia Power assumed the role of responsible party and has continued to cooperate with ongoing requirements for investigative
and corrective action. In December 2016, the Virginia State Water Control Board approved a consent order between the VDEQ and Virginia Power related to this matter, which included a penalty in excess of $100,000. In May 2017, the VDEQ formally
terminated the consent order, finding that all requirements had been completed. Also in May 2017, the U.S. Department of the Interior, on behalf of several federal and state agencies, proposed a settlement to resolve the agencies’ claims for
natural resource damages related to the mineral oil release. In January 2018, Virginia Power and the natural resource trustee agencies executed a settlement agreement that would require Virginia Power to pay approximately $400,000 to fund wetland
restoration and related projects in the location of the release. Final approval of the settlement is pending completion of a

30-day

public comment period which is expected during the first quarter of 2018.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Dominion
Energy has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the

underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different
assumptions. Dominion Energy has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.

CCOUNTING

FOR

R

EGULATED

O

PERATIONS

The accounting for Dominion Energy’s regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that Dominion
Energy is required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state

cost-of-service

rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated
companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise,
regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and
liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.

Dominion Energy evaluates whether or not recovery of
its regulatory assets through future rates is probable and makes various assumptions in its analysis. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation or historical experience, as well
as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

ETIREMENT

O

BLIGATIONS

Dominion Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be
reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine fair value and are generally capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of
quoted market prices, Dominion Energy estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement
activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation or credit-adjusted risk free rates in the future, may be significant.
When Dominion Energy revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased
operations, Dominion Energy adjusts the carrying amount of the ARO liability with such changes recognized in income. Dominion Energy accretes the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time.



In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Dominion Energy recognized $117 million, $104 million and
$93 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $117 million in 2018. Dominion Energy records accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs and regulated pipeline replacement AROs as an
adjustment to the regulatory liabilities related to these items.

A significant portion of Dominion Energy’s AROs relates to the
future decommissioning of its merchant and utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Power Generation segment. At December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy’s nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled
$1.5 billion, representing approximately 62% of its total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with Dominion Energy’s
nuclear decommissioning obligations.

Dominion Energy obtains from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies
in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for its nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for
extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, Dominion Energy’s cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. Dominion Energy
determines cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation
rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be critical assumptions.

NCOME

AXES

Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of

tax-related

assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws, including the provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. In
addition, the states in which we operate may or may not conform to some or all the provisions in the 2017 Tax Reform Act. Ultimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and
cash flows, and adjustments to

tax-related

assets and liabilities could be material.

Given the
uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns.
Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a

more-likely-than-not

recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by
tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy had $38 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts
expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.

Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences

between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion Energy evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current
and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or
successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. Dominion Energy establishes a valuation allowance when it is

more-likely-than-not

that all or a portion of a
deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy had established $146 million of valuation allowances.

The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes a broad range of tax reform provisions affecting the Companies, including changes in corporate tax rates and
business deductions. Many of these provisions differ significantly from prior U.S. tax law, resulting in pervasive financial reporting implications for the Companies. The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, including amendments which significantly change the taxation of individuals and business entities and includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities including Dominion Energy subsidiaries Questar Gas, Wexpro, Hope,
Virginia Power, and Dominion Energy Gas’ subsidiaries DETI and East Ohio. The more significant changes that impact the Companies included in the 2017 Tax Reform Act are (i) reducing the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (ii)
limiting the deductibility of interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income for certain businesses; (iii) permitting 100% expensing (100% bonus depreciation) for certain qualified property; (iv) eliminating the deduction for qualified domestic
production activities; and (v) limiting the utilization of net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. The specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the 2017
Tax Reform Act generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, the exclusion from full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and continues certain rate
normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits.

At the date of enactment, the Companies’ deferred taxes were
remeasured based upon the new tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are realized or settled. For regulated operations, many of the changes in deferred taxes represent amounts probable of collection from or refund to customers, and
are recorded as either an increase to a regulatory asset or liability. The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits.
Potential refunds of other deferred taxes may be determined by our state and federal regulators. For nonregulated operations, the changes in deferred taxes are recorded as an adjustment to deferred tax expense.

value. The majority of investments held in Dominion Energy’s nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trusts and pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting.
See Notes 6 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.

Fair value is based
on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing
information provided by brokers and other pricing services, Dominion Energy considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to
which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if Dominion Energy believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value,
judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, Dominion Energy must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis,
that reflect its market assumptions.

Dominion Energy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs
when measuring fair value.

ESTING

As of December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy reported $6.4 billion of goodwill in its
Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000 and the Dominion Energy Questar Combination in 2016.

In April of each year, Dominion Energy tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event
occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would

more-likely-than-not

reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2017, 2016 and 2015 annual tests and any interim tests did
not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.

In general, Dominion Energy estimates the fair value of its reporting units by
using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on
subjective factors such as Dominion Energy’s estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates
are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion Energy’s estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion
Energy has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time,
such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in

the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment
was present.

Impairment
testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with definite lives, and equity method investments is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When a long-lived asset’s carrying
amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. When an equity method investment’s carrying
amount exceeds its fair value, and the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets and
equity method investments involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets in the case of long-lived assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted
estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of a market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing,
expectations about the operations of the long-lived assets and equity method investments and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether a long-lived asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the
lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly
from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset or underlying assets of equity method investees, including future production and sales
levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain equity method investments.

LANS

Dominion Energy sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and
qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions
about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations, mortality rates and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a
significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion Energy’s



assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical
assumptions. Dominion Energy determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:

•

Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions;

•

Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes;

•

Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations;

•

Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major stock market indices; and

•

Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion Energy’s pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18%

non-U.S.

equity, 35% fixed income, 3%
real estate and 16% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments.

Strategic investment policies are
established for Dominion Energy’s prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates,
future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans’ strategic allocation are a function of Dominion Energy’s assessments regarding short-term risk and
reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans’ actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought
back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.

Dominion Energy develops

non-investment

related assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts
of an independent investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion Energy calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.75% for 2017,
2016 and 2015. For 2018, the expected long-term rate of return for pension cost assumption is 8.75%. Dominion Energy calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for
2017, 2016 and 2015. For 2018, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 8.50%. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost
because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets.

Dominion Energy determines discount
rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost ranged from 3.31% to 4.50% for pension plans
and 3.92% to

4.47% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2017, ranged from 2.87% to 4.99% for pension plans and 3.56% to 4.94% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2016 and were 4.40% in 2015.
Dominion Energy selected a discount rate ranging from 3.80% to 3.81% for pension plans and 3.76% for other postretirement benefit plans for determining its December 31, 2017 projected benefit obligations.

Dominion Energy establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions
of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion Energy’s healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2017 was 7.00% and is expected to gradually decrease to
5.00% by 2022 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.

Mortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for
postretirement benefit plans. Dominion Energy’s actuary conducts an experience study periodically as part of the process to select its best estimate of mortality. Dominion Energy considers both standard mortality tables and improvement factors
as well as the plans’ actual experience when selecting a best estimate. During 2016, Dominion Energy conducted a new experience study as scheduled and, as a result, updated its mortality assumptions.

The following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all
other assumptions constant:

In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2017, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would
increase Dominion Energy’s projected pension benefit obligation by $338 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $44 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $158 million.

Overview


VS

. 2016

Net income attributable to Dominion Energy increased 41%, primarily due to benefits resulting from the remeasurement of
deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate, the Dominion Energy Questar Combination and an absence of charges related to future ash pond and landfill closures. These increases were partially offset by lower renewable energy
investment tax credits and charges associated with equity method investments in wind-powered generation facilities.


VS

. 2015

Net income attributable to Dominion Energy increased 12%, primarily due to higher renewable energy investment tax credits and the new PJM capacity
performance market effective June 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields and charges related to future ash pond and landfill
closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.

An analysis of Dominion Energy’s results of operations follows:


VS

. 2016

Net revenue

increased 8%, primarily reflecting:

•

A $663 million increase from the operations acquired in the Dominion Energy Questar Combination being included for all of 2017;

•

A $97 million electric capacity benefit related to

non-utility

generators ($133 million) and a benefit due to the annual PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016
($123 million), partially offset by the annual PJM capacity performance market effective June 2017 ($159 million);

•

An $86 million increase due to additional generation output from merchant solar generating projects;

•

A $71 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers due to the effect of changes in customer usage and other factors, including $25 million related to customer growth;

•

A $63 million increase from regulated natural gas transmission growth projects placed in service;

•

A $46 million increase from rate adjustment clauses associated with electric utility operations; and

•

A $34 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline.

These
increases were partially offset by:

•

A $144 million decrease from Cove Point import contracts;

•

A $114 million decrease due to unfavorable pricing at merchant generation facilities; and

•

A decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers from a decrease in cooling degree days during the cooling season of 2017 ($53 million) and a reduction in heating degree days during the heating season of 2017
($28 million).

Other operations and maintenance

decreased 6%, primarily reflecting:

•

A $197 million absence of charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities;

•

A $115 million decrease in certain electric transmission-related expenditures. These expenses are primarily recovered through state and FERC rates and do not impact net income;

•

A $78 million benefit from the sale of certain assets associated with nonregulated retail energy marketing operations;

•

The absence of organizational design initiative costs ($64 million); and

•

A $46 million decrease in storm damage and service restoration costs associated with electric utility operations, partially offset by

•

A $162 million increase from the operations acquired in the Dominion Energy Questar Combination being included for all of 2017;

•

A $92 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits;

•

A $36 million increase in outage costs; and

•

A $33 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline. These expenses are billed to Atlantic Coast Pipeline and do not significantly impact net income.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

increased 22%, primarily due to the operations acquired in the Dominion Energy Questar Combination being included for all of 2017 ($162 million)



and various growth projects being placed into service ($151 million).

Other taxes

increased 12%, primarily due to the operations acquired in the Dominion Energy Questar Combination being included for all
of 2017 ($35 million) and increased property taxes related to growth projects placed into service ($27 million).

Other income

decreased 34%, primarily due to charges associated with equity method investments in wind-powered generation facilities
($158 million), partially offset by an increase in earnings, excluding charges, from equity method investments ($29 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($23 million).

Interest and related charges

increased 19%, primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense resulting from debt issuances in 2016 and 2017 ($171 million) and debt acquired in the Dominion Energy Questar Combination
($37 million).

Income tax expense

decreased $685 million, primarily due to benefits resulting from the remeasurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate ($851 million), partially offset by lower
renewable energy investment tax credits ($133 million).

2016 VS. 2015

Net revenue

increased 10%, primarily
reflecting:

•

A $544 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting:

•

A $225 million electric capacity benefit, primarily due to the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016 ($155 million) and the expiration of

non-utility

generator contracts in 2015 ($58 million);

•

An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($183 million); and

•

The absence of an $85 million

write-off

of deferred fuel costs associated with Virginia legislation enacted in February 2015; and

•

A $305 million increase due to the Dominion Energy Questar Combination.

These increases
were partially offset by:

•

A $47 million decrease from merchant generation operations, primarily due to lower realized prices at certain merchant generation facilities ($64 million) and an increase in planned and unplanned outage days in
2016 ($26 million), partially offset by additional solar generating facilities placed into service ($37 million);

•

A $19 million decrease from regulated natural gas transmission operations, primarily due to:

•

A $14 million decrease in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to decreased demand charges ($28 million), increased fuel costs ($13 million), contract rate changes ($11 million) and decreased
revenue from gathering and extraction services ($8 million), partially offset by expansion projects placed in service ($18 million) and increased regulated gas sales ($20 million); and

•

A $17 million decrease in NGL activities, due to decreased prices ($15 million) and volumes ($2 million); partially offset by

•

A $12 million increase in other revenues, primarily due to an increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline ($21 million), partially offset by decreased
amor-

tization of deferred revenue associated with conveyed shale development rights ($4 million); and

•

A $12 million decrease from regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily due to a decrease in rate adjustment clause revenue related to low income assistance programs ($26 million) and a decrease in
sales to customers due to a reduction in heating degree days ($6 million), partially offset by an increase in AMR and PIR program revenues ($18 million).

Other operations and maintenance

increased 18%, primarily reflecting:

•

A $148 million increase due to the Dominion Energy Questar Combination, including $58 million of transaction and transition costs;

•

A $98 million increase in charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities;

•

A $78 million decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields;

•

Organizational design initiative costs ($64 million);

•

A $50 million increase in storm damage and service restoration costs, including $23 million for Hurricane Matthew;

•

A $20 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline. These expenses are billed to Atlantic Coast Pipeline and do not significantly impact net income; and

•

A $16 million increase due to labor contract renegotiations as well as costs resulting from a union workforce temporary work stoppage; partially offset by

•

A $26 million decrease in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily related to low income assistance programs. These bad debt expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact
net income.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

increased 12%, primarily due to various expansion projects being placed into service.

Other income

increased
28%, primarily due to an increase in earnings from equity method investments ($55 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($12 million), partially offset by lower realized gains (net of investment income) on nuclear
decommissioning trust funds ($19 million).

Interest and related charges

increased 12%, primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense resulting from debt issuances in 2016 ($134 million), partially offset by an increase in capitalized
interest associated with the Cove Point Liquefaction Project ($45 million).

Income tax expense

decreased 28%, primarily due to higher renewable energy investment tax credits ($189 million) and the impact of a state legislative change ($14 million), partially offset by higher

pre-tax

income ($15
million).

Outlook

Dominion Energy’s strategy is
to continue focusing on its regulated and long-term contracted businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide EPS growth, a growing dividend and to maintain a
stable credit profile. Dominion Energy expects approximately 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

Dominion Energy’s 2018 net income is expected to decrease on a per share basis as compared
to 2017 primarily from the following:

•

Absence of a benefit from remeasurement of deferred income taxes from the 2017 Tax Reform Act;

•

Reduction of solar investment tax credits;

•

Increases in interest and related charges;

•

An increase in depreciation, depletion, and amortization; and

•

Share dilution.

These decreases are expected to be partially offset by the following:

•

Revenues from the Liquefaction Project;

•

A return to normal weather in its electric utility operations;

•

Growth in weather-normalized electric utility sales of approximately 1.5%;

•

Construction and operation of growth projects in electric utility operations and associated rate adjustment clause revenue;

•

Construction and operation of growth projects in gas transmission and distribution;

•

Absence of additional refueling outages at Millstone; and

•

A lower effective tax rate, driven by the tax reform.

In addition, if the merger with SCANA
is completed in 2018, it would result in a decrease to net income as the result of charges to be incurred for refunds to SCE&G electric customers, write-offs of regulatory assets and transaction costs.

ESOURCES

Dominion Energy depends on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. Short-term
cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities.

At December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy had $2.1 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities. See additional
discussion below under

Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt.

Operating Cash Flows

Net cash
provided by Dominion Energy’s operating activities increased $422 million, primarily due to the operations acquired in the Dominion Energy Questar combination being included for all of 2017, derivative activities, and lower income tax
payments, partially offset by lower deferred fuel cost recoveries in the Virginia jurisdiction, higher interest expense, lower revenue from Cove Point’s import contracts and higher pension and postretirement benefit payments and funding.

Dominion Energy believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute
to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In December 2017, Dominion Energy’s Board of Directors established an annual dividend rate for 2018 of $3.34 per share of common stock, a 10.0%
increase over the 2017 rate. Dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In January 2018, Dominion Energy’s Board of Directors declared dividends payable in March 2018 of 83.5 cents per share of common stock.

Beginning in 2018, the 2017 Tax Reform Act is expected to reduce customer rates due to lower income tax expense recoveries and the settlement
of income taxes refundable through future rates. The Companies’ regulated utilities continue to work with their respective regulatory commissions to determine the amount and timing of the 2017 Tax Reform Act benefits to customers. FERC has not
yet issued guidance on the 2017 Tax Reform Act. The ultimate resolution of the amount and timing of these rate reductions with the Companies’ regulators could be material to the Companies’ operating cash flows.

Dominion Energy’s operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash
flows, and which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Investing Cash Flows

Net cash used in Dominion Energy’s
investing activities decreased $4.7 billion, primarily due to the absence of the acquisition of Dominion Energy Questar and decreases in plant construction and other property additions, partially offset by an increase in acquisitions of solar
development projects and increased contributions to Atlantic Coast Pipeline.



Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity

Dominion Energy relies on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by its operations. As
discussed in

Credit Ratings

, Dominion Energy’s ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory
requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.

Dominion Energy currently meets the definition of a well-known
seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital.
This allows Dominion Energy to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.

From time to time, Dominion Energy may reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior
to maturity and repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.

Net cash
provided by Dominion Energy’s financing activities decreased $4.9 billion, primarily due to the absence of issuances of debt, common stock, and Dominion Energy Midstream common and convertible preferred units utilized to finance the
Dominion Energy Questar Combination in 2016.

Dominion Energy uses short-term debt to fund
working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations.
In addition, Dominion Energy utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion Energy’s credit ratings and the credit quality of its
counterparties.

In connection with commodity hedging activities, Dominion Energy is required to provide collateral to counterparties
under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, Dominion Energy may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time,
Dominion Energy may vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term
investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which Dominion Energy can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity
management objectives.

Dominion Energy’s commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity
available under credit facilities, were as follows:

The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by Dominion Energy’s credit facilities was 1.61% at December 31, 2017.

Dominion Energy has indicated its intention to replace the existing two joint revolving credit facilities with a $6.0 billion joint
revolving credit facility in the first quarter of 2018. Terms and covenants of the new credit facility are expected to be similar to the existing credit facilities, including that Virginia Power, Dominion Energy Gas and Questar Gas will remain
as

co-borrowers,

except that the maturity will be in five years and the maximum allowed total debt to total capital ratio, with respect to Dominion Energy only, will be increased from 65% to 67.5%. In February
2018, Virginia Power, as

co-borrower,

filed with the Virginia Commission for approval.

In
February 2018, Dominion Energy borrowed $950 million under a

364-Day

Term Loan Agreement that bears interest at a variable rate. In addition, the agreement contains a maximum allowed total debt to total
capital ratio of 67.5%. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay debt.

In July 2017, Dominion Energy Questar
repaid a $250 million variable rate term loan due in August 2017 at the amount of principal then outstanding plus accrued interest.

In November 2017, Dominion Energy filed an SEC shelf registration for the sale of up to $3.0 billion of variable denomination floating
rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability Investment

SM

. The registration limits the principal amount that may be outstanding at any one time to $1.0 billion. The notes
are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Dominion Energy Reliability Investment Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The notes have no stated maturity date, are

non-transferable

and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Dominion Energy or at the investor’s option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2017 was less than $0.1 million. The notes are
short-term debt obligations of Dominion Energy and are reflected as short-term debt on Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to repay debt.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit



quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion Energy believes that its current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets.
However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion Energy may affect its ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion Energy’s credit
ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities.

Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating
agencies in establishing an individual company’s credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion Energy
are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.

In January 2018, Moody’s affirmed Dominion Energy’s senior unsecured debt and commercial paper ratings of Baa2 and

P-2,

respectively, and Standard & Poor’s affirmed Dominion Energy’s senior unsecured debt and commercial paper ratings of BBB and

A-2,

respectively. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s each changed Dominion Energy’s rating outlook to negative from stable. Dominion Energy cannot predict the potential impact the negative outlook at Moody’s and
Standard & Poor’s could have on its cost of borrowing.

In January 2018, Fitch affirmed Dominion Energy’s senior
unsecured debt and commercial paper ratings of BBB+ and F2, respectively, and maintained its stable outlook for both ratings.

As of February 23, 2018, Fitch
maintained a stable outlook for its respective ratings of Dominion Energy and Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s maintained a negative outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion Energy.

A downgrade in an individual company’s credit rating does not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term
financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it could result in an increase in the cost of borrowing. Dominion Energy works closely with Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s with the objective of achieving
its targeted credit ratings. Dominion Energy may find it necessary to modify its business plan to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS.

Debt Covenants

As
part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion Energy must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration
of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a
waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion Energy.

Some of the typical covenants include:

•

The timely payment of principal and interest;

•

Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC and information about changes in Dominion Energy’s credit ratings to lenders;

•

Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all
assets;

•

Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and

•

Limitations on liens.

Dominion Energy is required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain
its credit facilities. In addition, Dominion Energy’s credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect its ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default
provisions.

As of December 31, 2017, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was
as follows:

$6.0 billion replacement joint revolving credit facility, expected to be executed in the first quarter of 2018, is expected to increase the maximum allowed total debt to total capital ratio from 65% to 67.5%.

(2)

Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes certain junior subordinated and remarketable subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

If Dominion Energy or any of its material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in
excess of $100 million, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under Dominion Energy’s credit facilities, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their
commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facilities. In addition, if the defaulting company is Virginia Power, Dominion Energy’s obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facilities could also be
accelerated and the lenders’ commitments to Dominion Energy could terminate.

will not occur. As of December 31, 2017, there have been no events of default under Dominion Energy’s debt covenants.

Dividend Restrictions

Certain agreements associated with Dominion Energy’s credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These
limitations did not restrict Dominion Energy’s ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at December 31, 2017.

XPENDITURES

Dominion Energy’s planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately
$5.5 billion, $5.2 billion and $4.8 billion in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Dominion Energy’s planned expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission and
storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel, maintenance and Dominion Energy’s portion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.

Dominion Energy expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term
borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors.



See

Item 1. Business for a discussion of Dominion Energy’s expansion plans.

These estimates are based on a capital expenditures
plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominion Energy’s Board of Directors in late 2017 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. Dominion Energy may also choose to postpone or
cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.

RRANGEMENT

In July 2016, Dominion Energy signed an agreement with a lessor to construct and lease a new corporate office property in Richmond, Virginia. The lessor is
providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $365 million, to fund the estimated project costs. The project is expected to be completed by

mid-2019.

Dominion
Energy has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor, during which time Dominion Energy will request cash draws from the lessor and debt investors to fund all project costs, which totaled $139 million as of
December 31, 2017. If the project is terminated under certain events of default, Dominion Energy could be required to pay up to 89.9% of the then funded amount. For specific full recourse events, Dominion Energy could be required to pay up to
100% of the then funded amount.

The five-year lease term will commence once construction is substantially complete and the facility is
able to be occupied. At the end of the initial lease term, Dominion Energy can (i) extend the term of the lease for an additional five years, subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property
for an amount equal to the project costs or, (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property on behalf of the lessor to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the
property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the project costs, Dominion Energy may be required to make a payment to the lessor, up to 87% of project costs, for the difference between
the project costs and sale proceeds.

The respective transactions have been structured so that Dominion Energy is not considered the owner
during construction for financial accounting purposes and, therefore, will not reflect the construction activity in its consolidated financial statements. The financial accounting treatment of the lease agreement will be impacted by the new
accounting standard issued in February 2016. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Dominion Energy will be considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes, and as a result, will be entitled to
tax deductions for depreciation and interest expense.

EGULATIONS

Air

The CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a
broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation’s air quality. At a minimum, delegated states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop
regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies’ facilities are subject to the CAA’s permitting and other requirements.

In August 2015, the EPA issued final carbon standards for existing fossil fuel power plants. Known as the Clean Power Plan, the rule uses a
set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units and expanding renewable resources. The
final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the disposition of the petitions challenging the rule now before the Court of
Appeals, and, if such petitions are filed in the future, before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pursuant to an Executive Order directing the EPA to undertake a review of the Clean Power Plan, the EPA issued a proposed rule in October 2017 to repeal the
Clean Power Plan on the basis that the rule promulgated in 2015 exceeds the



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

EPA’s authority under the CAA. In December 2017, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit input on whether it should proceed with a rule to replace the Clean
Power Plan, and if so, what the scope of such a rule should be. Given these developments and associated federal and state regulatory and legal uncertainties, Dominion Energy cannot predict the potential financial statement impacts but believes the
potential expenditures to comply could be material.

Climate Change

In December 2015, the Paris Agreement was formally adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A key element of the initial
U.S. commitment to the agreement was the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which the EPA has proposed to repeal. In June 2017, the Administration announced that the U.S. intends to file to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2019. Several
states, including Virginia, subsequently announced a commitment to achieving the carbon reduction goals of the Paris Agreement. It is not possible at this time to predict the timing and impact of this withdrawal, or how any legal requirements in the
U.S. at the federal, state or local levels pursuant to the Paris Agreement could impact the Companies’ customers or the business.

In
March 2016, the EPA began development of regulations for reducing methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sectors. In November 2016, the EPA issued an Information Collection Request to collect information on existing
sources upstream of local distribution companies in this sector. In March 2017, the EPA withdrew the information collection request and it remains unclear whether the EPA may propose new regulations on existing sources. Dominion Energy cannot
currently estimate the potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows related to this matter.

State Actions Related
to Air and GHG Emissions

In August 2017, the Ozone Transport Commission released a draft model rule for control of NO

x

emissions from natural gas pipeline compressor fuel-fire prime movers. States within the ozone transport region, including states in which Dominion Energy has natural gas operations, are expected
to develop reasonably achievable control technology rules for existing sources based on the Ozone Transport Commission model rule. States outside of the Ozone Transport Commission may also consider the model rules in setting new reasonably
achievable control technology standards. Several states in which Dominion Energy operates, including Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland, are developing state-specific regulations to control GHG emissions, including methane. In January 2018, the
VDEQ published for comment a proposed state carbon regulation program linked to RGGI. Dominion Energy cannot currently estimate the potential financial statements impacts on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows related to
these matters.

PHMSA Regulation

The most recent
reauthorization of PHMSA included new provisions on historical records research, maximum-allowed operating

pressure validation, use of automated or remote-controlled valves on new or replaced lines, increased civil penalties and evaluation of expanding integrity management beyond high-consequence
areas. PHMSA has not yet issued new rulemaking on most of these items.

Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the
Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain

over-the

counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a
designated contract market or swap execution facility.

Non-financial

entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the

end-user

exception to the CEA’s clearing requirements. Dominion Energy has elected to exempt its swaps from the CEA’s clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process,
Dominion Energy’s derivative activities are not exempted from clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, Dominion
Energy’s swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Due to the evolving rulemaking process,
Dominion Energy is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act’s derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

OF


In January
2018, legislation was introduced in the Virginia General Assembly to reinstate base rate reviews on a triennial basis other than the first review, which will be a quadrennial review, occurring for Virginia Power in 2021 for the four successive

12-month

test periods beginning January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2020. This review for Virginia Power will occur one year earlier than under the Regulation Act legislation enacted in February 2015.

In the triennial review proceedings, earnings that are more than 70 basis points above the utility’s authorized return on equity
that might have been refunded to customers may be reduced by any prior investment amounts for new solar or wind generation facilities or up to 5,000 MW of new solar or wind generation facilities and electric distribution grid transformation projects
that Virginia Power elects to include in a customer credit reinvestment offset. The legislation declares that electric distribution grid transformation projects are in the public interest and provides that the costs of such projects may be recovered
through a rate adjustment clause if not the subject of a customer credit reinvestment offset. Any costs that are the subject of a customer credit reinvestment offset may not be recovered in base rates for the service life of the projects and may not
be included in base rates in future triennial review proceedings.

The legislation also includes provisions requiring Virginia Power to
provide current customers a

one-time

bill credit of



$200 million and to reduce base rates to reflect reductions in federal tax liability resulting from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act. The legislation is pending.

Other Matters

While management currently has no plans which may
affect the carrying value of Millstone, based on potential future economic and other factors, including, but not limited to, market power prices, results of capacity auctions, legislative and regulatory solutions to ensure nuclear plants are fairly
compensated for their carbon-free generation, and the impact of potential EPA carbon rules; there is risk that Millstone may be evaluated for an early retirement date. Should management make any decision on a potential early retirement date, the
precise date and the resulting financial statement impacts, which could be material to Dominion Energy, may be affected by a number of factors, including any potential regulatory or legislative solutions, results of any transmission system
reliability study assessments, and decommissioning requirements, among other factors.

ANAGEMENT

The Companies’ financial instruments, commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to
potential losses due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity security prices as described below. Commodity price risk is present in Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s electric operations and Dominion
Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ natural gas procurement and marketing operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for electricity, natural gas and other commodities. The Companies use commodity derivative
contracts to manage price risk exposures for these operations. Interest rate risk is generally related to their outstanding debt and future issuances of debt. In addition, the Companies are exposed to investment price risk through various portfolios
of equity and debt securities.

The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from
market risk sensitive instruments over a selected time period due to a 10% change in commodity prices or interest rates.

Commodity Price Risk

To manage price risk, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power hold commodity-based derivative instruments held for

non-trading

purposes associated with purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products and Dominion Energy Gas

primarily holds commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for

non-trading

purposes associated with purchases and sales of natural gas and other
energy-related products.

The derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are executed within established policies and procedures and
may include instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, options and FTRs that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the hypothetical change in market prices of commodity-based financial
derivative instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments. Prices and
volatility are principally determined based on observable market prices.

A hypothetical 10% decrease in commodity prices would have
resulted in a decrease in fair value of $5 million and $27 million of Dominion Energy’s commodity-based derivative instruments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The decrease in sensitivity is
largely due to a decrease in commodity derivative activity and changes in commodity prices.

A hypothetical 10% decrease in commodity
prices would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of $51 million and $62 million of Virginia Power’s commodity-based derivative instruments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The decrease
in sensitivity is largely due to a decrease in commodity derivative activity and lower commodity prices.

A hypothetical 10% increase in
commodity prices of Dominion Energy Gas’ commodity-based financial derivative instruments would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $4 million as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on the Companies’ commodity-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time
is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from commodity derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by
recognition of the hedged transaction, such as revenue from physical sales of the commodity.

Interest Rate Risk

The Companies manage their interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. They also enter into interest
rate sensitive derivatives, including interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. For variable rate debt and interest rate swaps designated under fair value hedging and outstanding for the Companies, a hypothetical 10% increase in market
interest rates would not have resulted in a material change in annual earnings at December 31, 2017 or 2016.

The Companies also use
interest rate derivatives, including forward-starting swaps, as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments. As of December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had $3.5 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, in
aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $86 million and $67 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion
Energy’s and Virginia Power’s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

$2.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would
have resulted in a decrease of $58 million and $45 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2016.

During 2016, Dominion Energy Gas entered into foreign currency swaps with the purpose of hedging the foreign currency exchange risk associated
with Euro denominated debt. As of December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas had $280 million (€ 250 million) in aggregate notional amounts of these foreign currency swaps outstanding. A hypothetical 10% increase
in market interest rates would have resulted in a $6 million decrease in the fair value of Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ foreign currency swaps at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, Dominion Energy and
Dominion Energy Gas had $280 million (€ 250 million) in aggregate notional amounts of these foreign currency swaps outstanding. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a $5 million decrease in
the fair value of Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’s foreign currency swaps at December 31, 2016.

The impact of a
change in interest rates on the Companies’ interest rate-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains
and/or losses from interest rate derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction.

Investment Price Risk

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are
subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust funds that are managed by third-party investment managers. These trust funds primarily hold marketable securities that are reported in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

Dominion Energy recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear
decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $167 million and $144 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines
in fair value. Dominion Energy recorded, in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains of $462 million and $183 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Virginia Power recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust investments of $76 million
and $67 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Virginia Power recorded, in AOCI and regulatory
liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains of $216 million and $93 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Dominion Energy
sponsors pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas employees participate in these plans. Dominion Energy’s pension and other
postretirement plan assets experienced aggregate actual returns of $1.6 billion and $534 million in 2017

and 2016, respectively, versus expected returns of $767 million and $691 million, respectively. Dominion Energy Gas’ pension and other postretirement plan assets for employees
represented by collective bargaining units experienced aggregate actual returns of $335 million and $130 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, versus expected returns of $165 million and $157 million, respectively. Differences
between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the net periodic cost recognized for such employee
benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans. A hypothetical 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rates of return on Dominion Energy’s plan assets would result
in an increase in net periodic cost of $19 million and $18 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for pension benefits and $4 million as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016, for other postretirement benefits.
A hypothetical 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rates of return on Dominion Energy Gas’ plan assets, for employees represented by collective bargaining units, would result in an increase in net periodic cost of $4 million as of both
December 31, 2017 and 2016, for pension benefits and $1 million as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016, for other postretirement benefits.

Risk
Management Policies

The Companies have established operating procedures with corporate management to ensure that proper internal controls are
maintained. In addition, Dominion Energy has established an independent function at the corporate level to monitor compliance with the credit and commodity risk management policies of all subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Energy
Gas. Dominion Energy maintains credit policies that include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty’s financial condition, collateral requirements where deemed necessary and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of
cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition, Dominion Energy also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis. Based on these credit policies and the Companies’ December 31, 2017
provision for credit losses, management believes that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on the Companies’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

Opinion on the Consolidated
Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dominion Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Dominion
Energy”) at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dominion Energy at December 31, 2017 and
2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), Dominion
Energy’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February 27, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on Dominion Energy’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of Dominion Energy’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Dominion Energy’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Dominion Energy in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Opinion on the
Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Virginia Electric and Power Company (a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy, Inc.) and subsidiaries (“Virginia Power”) at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common shareholder’s equity, and cash
flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Virginia Power at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Virginia Power’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Virginia
Power’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Virginia
Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Virginia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Virginia Power’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

To the Board of Directors of

Dominion Energy Gas Holdings, LLC

Opinion on the
Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dominion Energy Gas Holdings, LLC (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Dominion Energy, Inc.) and subsidiaries (“Dominion Energy Gas”) at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Dominion Energy Gas at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Dominion Energy Gas’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Dominion Energy Gas’ consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
Dominion Energy Gas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Dominion Energy Gas is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Dominion Energy Gas’ internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks
of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

PERATIONS

Dominion Energy, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is one of the nation’s largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominion Energy’s
operations are conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas. Virginia Power is a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and northeastern North
Carolina. Virginia Power is a member of PJM, an RTO, and its electric transmission facilities are integrated into the PJM wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Power’s stock is owned by Dominion Energy. Dominion Energy Gas is a holding
company that conducts business activities through a regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and underground storage system in the Northeast,

mid-Atlantic

and Midwest states, regulated gas
transportation and distribution operations in Ohio, and gas gathering and processing activities primarily in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. All of Dominion Energy Gas’ membership interests are held by Dominion Energy. The Dominion Energy
Questar Combination was completed in September 2016. See Note 3 for a description of operations acquired in the Dominion Energy Questar Combination.

Dominion Energy’s operations also include the Cove Point LNG import, transport and storage facility in Maryland, an equity investment
in Atlantic Coast Pipeline and regulated gas transportation and distribution operations in West Virginia. Dominion Energy’s nonregulated operations include merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities, retail
energy marketing operations and an equity investment in Blue Racer.

In October 2014, Dominion Energy Midstream launched its initial
public offering of 20,125,000 common units representing limited partner interests. At December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy owns the general partner, 50.6% of the common and subordinated units and 37.5% of the convertible preferred interests in
Dominion Energy Midstream, which owns a preferred equity interest and the general partner interest in Cove Point, DECG, Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline and a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. The public’s ownership
interest in Dominion Energy Midstream is reflected as noncontrolling interest in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dominion Energy manages its daily operations through three primary operating segments: Power Delivery, Power Generation and Gas
Infrastructure. Dominion Energy also reports a Corporate and Other segment, which includes its corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt). In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to
Dominion Energy’s operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’ performance or in allocating resources.

Virginia Power manages its daily operations through two primary operating segments: Power Delivery and Power Generation. It also reports a
Corporate and Other segment that primarily includes specific items attributable to its operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’ performance or in allocating
resources.

Dominion Energy Gas manages its daily operations through one primary operating segment: Gas
Infrastructure. It also reports a Corporate and Other segment that primarily includes specific items attributable to its operating segment that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segment’s
performance or in allocating resources and the effect of certain items recorded at Dominion Energy Gas as a result of Dominion Energy’s basis in the net assets contributed.

See Note 25 for further discussion of the Companies’ operating segments.

OLICIES

General

The Companies make certain estimates and assumptions in
preparing their Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses and cash flows for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

The Companies’ Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, the accounts of
their respective majority-owned subsidiaries and

non-wholly-owned

entities in which they have a controlling financial interest. For certain partnership structures, income is allocated based on the liquidation
value of the underlying contractual arrangements. NRG’s ownership interest in Four Brothers and Three Cedars, as well as Terra Nova Renewable Partners’ 33% interest in certain of Dominion Energy’s merchant solar projects, is reflected
as noncontrolling interest in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 3 for further information on these transactions.

The Companies report certain contracts, instruments and investments at fair value. See Note 6 for further information on fair value
measurements.

Dominion Energy maintains pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas
participate in certain of these plans. See Note 21 for further information on these plans.

Certain amounts in the 2016 and 2015
Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect the Companies’ net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash
flows, except for the reclassification of debt issuance costs.

Amounts disclosed for Dominion Energy are inclusive of Virginia Power
and/or Dominion Energy Gas, where applicable.

Operating Revenue

Operating revenue is recorded on the basis of services rendered, commodities delivered or contracts settled and includes amounts yet to be billed to
customers. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power collect sales, consumption and consumer utility taxes and Dominion Energy Gas collects sales taxes; however, these amounts are excluded from revenue. Dominion Energy’s customer receivables at
December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $661 million and $631 million, respectively, of accrued unbilled



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity and natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its utility customers. Virginia Power’s customer receivables at December 31, 2017
and 2016 included $400 million and $349 million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity delivered but not yet billed to its customers. Dominion Energy Gas’ customer receivables at
December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $121 million and $134 million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers. See Note 9 for amounts
attributable to related parties.

The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Dominion Energy are
as follows:

•

Regulated electric sales

consist primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales, and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services;

•

Nonregulated electric sales

consist primarily of sales of electricity at market-based rates and contracted fixed rates, and associated derivative activity;

•

Regulated gas sales

consist primarily of state- and FERC-regulated natural gas sales and related distribution services and associated derivative activity;

•

Nonregulated gas sales

consist primarily of sales of natural gas production at market-based rates and contracted fixed prices, sales of gas purchased from third parties, gas trading and marketing revenue and
associated derivative activity;

•

Gas transportation and storage

consists primarily of FERC-regulated sales of transmission and storage services. Also included are state-regulated gas distribution charges to retail distribution service customers
opting for alternate suppliers and sales of gathering services; and

•

Other revenue

consists primarily of sales of NGL production and condensate, extracted products and associated derivative activity. Other revenue also includes miscellaneous service revenue from electric and gas
distribution operations, sales of energy-related products and services from Dominion Energy’s retail energy marketing operations and gas processing and handling revenue.

The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Virginia Power are as follows:

•

Regulated electric sales

consist primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services; and

•

Other revenue

consists primarily of miscellaneous service revenue from electric distribution operations and miscellaneous revenue from generation operations, including sales of capacity and other commodities.

The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Dominion Energy Gas are as follows:

•

Regulated gas sales

consist primarily of state- and FERC-regulated natural gas sales and related distribution services;

•

Nonregulated gas sales

consist primarily of sales of natural gas production at market-based rates and contracted fixed prices and sales of gas purchased from third parties. Revenue from sales of gas production is
recognized based on actual volumes of gas sold to purchasers and is reported net of royalties;

•

Gas transportation and storage

consists primarily of FERC-regulated sales of transmission and storage services. Also

included are state-regulated gas distribution charges to retail distribution service customers opting for alternate suppliers and sales of gathering services;

•

NGL revenue

consists primarily of sales of NGL production and condensate, extracted products and associated derivative activity; and

•

Other revenue

consists primarily of miscellaneous service revenue, gas processing and handling revenue.

Electric Fuel, Purchased Energy and Purchased

Gas-Deferred

Costs

Where permitted by regulatory authorities, the differences between Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s actual electric fuel and purchased energy
expenses and Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ purchased gas expenses and the related levels of recovery for these expenses in current rates are deferred and matched against recoveries in future periods. The deferral of costs in
excess of current period fuel rate recovery is recognized as a regulatory asset, while rate recovery in excess of current period fuel expenses is recognized as a regulatory liability.

Of the cost of fuel used in electric generation and energy purchases to serve utility customers, approximately 84% is currently subject to
deferred fuel accounting, while substantially all of the remaining amount is subject to recovery through similar mechanisms.

Virtually
all of Dominion Energy Gas’, Cove Point’s, Questar Gas’ and Hope’s natural gas purchases are either subject to deferral accounting or are recovered from the customer in the same accounting period as the sale.

Income Taxes

A consolidated federal income tax return is filed for
Dominion Energy and its subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas’ subsidiaries. In addition, where applicable, combined income tax returns for Dominion Energy and its subsidiaries are filed in various states; otherwise,
separate state income tax returns are filed.

Although Dominion Energy Gas is disregarded for income tax purposes, a provision for income
taxes is recognized to reflect the inclusion of its business activities in the tax returns of its parent, Dominion Energy. Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas participate in intercompany tax sharing agreements with Dominion Energy and its
subsidiaries. Current income taxes are based on taxable income or loss and credits determined on a separate company basis.

Under the
agreements, if a subsidiary incurs a tax loss or earns a credit, recognition of current income tax benefits is limited to refunds of prior year taxes obtained by the carryback of the net operating loss or credit or to the extent the tax loss or
credit is absorbed by the taxable income of other Dominion Energy consolidated group members. Otherwise, the net operating loss or credit is carried forward and is recognized as a deferred tax asset until realized.

The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes a broad range of tax reform provisions affecting the Companies, including changes in corporate tax rates and
business deductions. The 2017 Tax Reform Act reduces the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance



Sheets and measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are realized or settled. Thus, at the date of enactment, federal deferred taxes were remeasured based upon
the new 21% tax rate. The total effect of tax rate changes on deferred tax balances is recorded as a component of the income tax provision related to continuing operations for the period in which the law is enacted, even if the assets and
liabilities relate to other components of the financial statements, such as items of accumulated other comprehensive income. For Dominion Energy subsidiaries that are not rate-regulated utilities, existing deferred income tax assets or liabilities
were adjusted for the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and allocated to continuing operations. Dominion Energy’s rate-regulated utility subsidiaries likewise are required to adjust deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the
change in income tax rates. However, if it is probable that the effect of the change in income tax rates will be recovered or refunded in future rates, the regulated utility recorded a regulatory asset or liability instead of an increase or decrease
to deferred income tax expense.

Accounting for income taxes involves an asset and liability approach. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are provided, representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Accordingly, deferred taxes are recognized for the future
consequences of different treatments used for the reporting of transactions in financial accounting and income tax returns. The Companies establish a valuation allowance when it is

more-likely-than-not

that
all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Where the treatment of temporary differences is different for rate-regulated operations, a regulatory asset is recognized if it is probable that future revenues will be provided for
the payment of deferred tax liabilities.

The Companies recognize positions taken, or expected to be taken, in income tax returns that are

more-likely-than-not

to be realized, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.

If it is not

more-likely-than-not

that a tax position, or some portion thereof, will be sustained, the
related tax benefits are not recognized in the financial statements. Unrecognized tax benefits may result in an increase in income taxes payable, a reduction of income tax refunds receivable or changes in deferred taxes. Also, when uncertainty about
the deductibility of an amount is limited to the timing of such deductibility, the increase in income taxes payable (or reduction in tax refunds receivable) is accompanied by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities. Except when such amounts are
presented net with amounts receivable from or amounts prepaid to tax authorities, noncurrent income taxes payable related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified in other deferred credits and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
and current payables are included in accrued interest, payroll and taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Companies recognize
interest on underpayments and overpayments of income taxes in interest expense and other income, respectively. Penalties are also recognized in other income.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power both recognized interest income of $11 million in 2017. Dominion Energy Gas’ interest was
immaterial in 2017. Interest for the Companies was immaterial in 2016 and 2015. Dominion Energy’s, Virginia

Power’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ penalties were immaterial in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

At December 31, 2017, Virginia Power had an income

tax-related

affiliated payable of
$16 million, comprised of $16 million of federal income taxes due to Dominion Energy. Dominion Energy Gas also had an affiliated payable of $25 million due to Dominion Energy, representing $21 million of federal income taxes and
$4 million of state income taxes. The net affiliated payables are expected to be paid to Dominion Energy.

In addition, Virginia
Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017 included $1 million of noncurrent federal income taxes receivable, less than $1 million of state income taxes receivable and $1 million of noncurrent state income taxes
receivable. Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017 included $14 million of state income taxes receivable.

At December 31, 2016, Virginia Power had an income

tax-related

affiliated receivable of
$112 million, comprised of $122 million of federal income taxes due from Dominion Energy net of $10 million for state income taxes due to Dominion Energy. Dominion Energy Gas also had an affiliated receivable of $11 million due
from Dominion Energy, representing $10 million of federal income taxes and $1 million of state income taxes. The net affiliated receivables were refunded by Dominion Energy.

In addition, Virginia Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 included $2 million of noncurrent federal income
taxes payable, $6 million of state income taxes receivable and $13 million of noncurrent state income taxes receivable. Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 included $1 million of noncurrent
federal income taxes payable, $1 million of state income taxes receivable and $7 million of noncurrent state income taxes payable.

Investment tax credits are recognized by nonregulated operations in the year qualifying property is placed in service. For regulated
operations, investment tax credits are deferred and amortized over the service lives of the properties giving rise to the credits. Production tax credits are recognized as energy is generated and sold.

Derivative Instruments

Dominion Energy uses derivative instruments such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options and FTRs to manage the commodity, interest rate
and foreign currency exchange rate risks of its business operations. Virginia Power uses derivative instruments such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity and interest rate risks. Dominion Energy
Gas uses derivative instruments such as physical and financial forwards, futures and swaps to manage commodity, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.

All derivatives, except those for which an exception applies, are required to be reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
Derivative contracts representing unrealized gain positions and purchased options are reported as derivative assets. Derivative contracts representing unrealized losses and options sold are reported as derivative liabilities. One of the exceptions
to fair value accounting, normal purchases and normal sales, may be elected when the contract satisfies certain criteria, including a requirement that physical delivery of the underlying commodity is probable. Expenses and revenues resulting from
deliveries under normal purchase contracts and normal sales contracts, respectively, are included in earnings at the time of contract performance.

The Companies do not offset amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against
amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. Dominion Energy had margin assets of $92 million and $82 million associated with cash collateral at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Dominion Energy’s margin liabilities associated with cash collateral at December 31, 2017 or 2016 were immaterial. Virginia Power had margin assets of $23 million and $2 million
associated with cash collateral at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Virginia Power’s margin liabilities associated with cash collateral were immaterial at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Dominion Energy Gas’ margin assets
and liabilities associated with cash collateral were immaterial at December 31, 2017 and 2016. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives.

To manage price risk, the Companies hold certain derivative instruments that are not designated
as hedges for accounting purposes. However, to the extent the Companies do not hold offsetting positions for such derivatives, they believe these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate their exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.
All income statement activity, including amounts realized upon settlement, is presented in operating revenue, operating expenses, interest and related charges or other income based on the nature of the underlying risk.

Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments result in the recognition of regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities for jurisdictions
subject to cost-based rate regulation. Realized gains or losses on the derivative instruments are generally recognized when the related transactions impact earnings.

NSTRUMENTS

The Companies designate a portion of their derivative instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges for accounting purposes. For all derivatives
designated as hedges, the Companies formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and the strategy for using the hedging instrument. The Companies assess whether the
hedging relationship between the derivative and the hedged item is highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Any change in the fair value of the
derivative that is not effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged item is recognized currently in earnings. Also, the Companies may elect to exclude certain gains or losses on hedging instruments from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as gains or losses attributable to changes in the time value of options or changes in the difference between spot prices and forward prices, thus requiring that such changes be recorded currently in earnings.
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively for derivatives that cease to be highly effective hedges. For derivative instruments that are accounted for as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, the cash flows from the derivatives and from the
related hedged items are classified in operating cash flows.

Cash Flow Hedges

-A majority of the Companies’ hedge strategies
represents cash flow hedges of the variable price risk associated with the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas and NGLs. The Companies also use interest rate swaps to hedge their exposure to variable interest rates on long-term debt as
well as foreign currency swaps to hedge their exposure to interest payments denominated in Euros. For transactions in which the Companies are hedging the variability of cash flows, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in AOCI,
to the extent they are effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item. Any derivative gains or losses reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the forecasted item is included in earnings, or earlier, if it becomes probable that the
forecasted transaction will not occur. For cash flow hedge transactions, hedge accounting is discontinued if the occurrence of the forecasted transaction is no longer probable.

Dominion Energy entered into interest rate derivative instruments to hedge its forecasted interest payments related to planned debt issuances
in 2014. These interest rate derivatives were designated by Dominion Energy as cash flow hedges prior to the



formation of Dominion Energy Gas. For the purposes of the Dominion Energy Gas financial statements, the derivative balances, AOCI balance, and any income statement impact related to these
interest rate derivative instruments entered into by Dominion Energy have been, and will continue to be, included in the Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Financial Statements as the forecasted interest payments related to the debt issuances
now occur at Dominion Energy Gas.

Fair Value Hedges

-Dominion Energy also uses fair value hedges to mitigate the fixed price
exposure inherent in commodity inventory. In addition, Dominion Energy has designated interest rate swaps as fair value hedges on certain fixed rate long-term debt to manage interest rate exposure. For fair value hedge transactions, changes in the
fair value of the derivative are generally offset currently in earnings by the recognition of changes in the hedged item’s fair value. Hedge accounting is discontinued if the hedged item no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. See Note 6 for
further information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives. See Note 7 for further information on derivatives.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at lower of original cost or fair value, if impaired. Capitalized costs include labor,
materials and other direct and indirect costs such as asset retirement costs, capitalized interest and, for certain operations subject to

cost-of-service

rate
regulation, AFUDC and overhead costs. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including minor additions and replacements, is generally charged to expense as it is incurred.

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Dominion Energy capitalized interest costs and AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $236 million,
$159 million and $100 million, respectively. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Virginia Power capitalized AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $37 million, $21 million and $30 million, respectively. In 2017, 2016 and 2015,
Dominion Energy Gas capitalized AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $25 million, $8 million and $1 million, respectively.

Under Virginia law, certain Virginia jurisdictional projects qualify for current recovery of AFUDC through rate adjustment clauses. AFUDC on
these projects is calculated and recorded as a regulatory asset and is not capitalized to property, plant and equipment. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Virginia Power recorded $22 million, $31 million and $19 million of AFUDC related to
these projects, respectively.

For property subject to

cost-of-service

rate regulation, including Virginia Power electric distribution, electric transmission, and generation property, Dominion Energy Gas natural gas
distribution and transmission property, and for certain Dominion Energy natural gas property, the undepreciated cost of such property, less salvage value, is generally charged to accumulated depreciation at retirement. Cost of removal collections
from utility customers not representing AROs are recorded as regulatory liabilities. For property subject to

cost-of-service

rate regulation that will be abandoned
significantly before the end of its useful life, the net carrying value is reclassified from

plant-in-service

when it becomes probable it will be abandoned.

For property that is not subject to

cost-of-service

rate
regulation, including nonutility property, cost of removal not
asso-

ciated with AROs is charged to expense as incurred. The Companies also record gains and losses upon retirement based upon the difference between the proceeds received, if any, and the
property’s net book value at the retirement date.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line
method based on projected service lives. The Companies’ average composite depreciation rates on utility property, plant and equipment are as follows:

In the first quarter of 2017, Virginia Power revised the depreciation rates for its assets to reflect the
results of a new depreciation study. This change resulted in an increase in annual depreciation expense of $40 million ($25 million

after-tax)

for 2017. Additionally, Dominion Energy revised the
depreciable lives for its merchant generation assets, excluding Millstone, which resulted in a decrease in annual depreciation expense of $26 million ($16 million

after-tax)

for 2017.

Capitalized costs of development wells and leaseholds are amortized on a

field-by-field

basis using the

depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives between 10 and 50 years.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

Nuclear fuel used in electric generation is amortized over its estimated service life on a

units-of-production

basis. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power report the amortization of nuclear fuel in electric fuel and other energy-related purchases expense in their
Consolidated Statements of Income and in depreciation and amortization in their Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

The Companies perform an evaluation for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets or
intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. A long-lived or intangible asset is written down to fair value if the sum of its expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying amount. Intangible assets with finite
lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The accounting for Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ regulated gas and Virginia Power’s regulated electric operations differs from the
accounting for nonregulated operations in that they are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state

cost-of-service

rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that
regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized
when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income
over the period authorized by the regulator.

The Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future
rates is probable and make various assumptions in their analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable
regulatory authorities and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Companies recognize AROs at fair
value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of future retirement activities to be performed, for which a legal obligation exists. These amounts are generally capitalized as
costs of the related tangible long-lived assets. Since relevant market information is not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. Quarterly, the Companies assess their AROs to determine if circumstances indicate that
estimates of the amounts or timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities have changed. AROs are adjusted when significant changes in the amounts or timing of future cash flows are identified. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy
Gas report accretion of AROs and depreciation on asset retirement costs associated with their natural gas pipeline and storage well assets as an adjustment to the related regulatory

liabilities when revenue is recoverable from customers for AROs. Virginia Power reports accretion of AROs and depreciation on asset retirement costs associated with decommissioning its nuclear
power stations as an adjustment to the regulatory liability for certain jurisdictions. Additionally, Virginia Power reports accretion of AROs and depreciation on asset retirement costs associated with certain rider and prospective rider projects as
an adjustment to the regulatory asset for certain jurisdictions. Accretion of all other AROs and depreciation of all other asset retirement costs are reported in other operations and maintenance expense and depreciation expense, respectively, in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Debt Issuance Costs

The
Companies defer and amortize debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts over the expected lives of the respective debt issues, considering maturity dates and, if applicable, redemption rights held by others. Deferred debt issuance costs are
recorded as a reduction in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of the issuance costs is reported as interest expense. Unamortized costs associated with redemptions of debt securities prior to stated maturity dates are
generally recognized and recorded in interest expense immediately. As permitted by regulatory authorities, gains or losses resulting from the refinancing of debt allocable to utility operations subject to cost-based rate regulation are deferred and
amortized over the lives of the new issuances.

The Companies periodically review their investments to determine whether a decline in fair value should be considered
other-than-temporary. If a decline in fair value of any security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to its fair value at the end of the reporting period.

Decommissioning Trust Investments—Special Considerations

•

The recognition provisions of the FASB’s other-than-temporary impairment guidance apply only to debt securities classified as

available-for-sale

or

held-to-maturity,

while the presentation and disclosure
requirements apply to both debt and equity securities.

•

Debt Securities

—Using information obtained from their nuclear decommissioning trust fixed-income investment managers, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power record in earnings any unrealized loss for a debt
security when the manager intends to sell the debt security or it is

more-likely-than-not

that the manager will have to sell the debt security before recovery of its fair value up to its cost basis. If that is
not the case, but the debt security is deemed to have experienced a credit loss, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power record the credit loss in earnings and any remaining portion of the unrealized loss in AOCI. Credit losses are evaluated primarily by
considering the credit ratings of the issuer, prior instances of

non-performance

by the issuer and other factors.

•

Equity securities and other investments

—Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s method of assessing other-than-temporary declines requires demonstrating the ability to hold individual securities for
a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in their market value prior to the

consideration of the other criteria mentioned above. Since Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have limited ability to oversee the

day-to-day

management of nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, they do not have the ability to ensure investments are held through an anticipated recovery
period. Accordingly, they consider all equity and other securities as well as

non-marketable

investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts with market values below their cost bases to be
other-than-temporarily impaired.

Inventories

Materials and supplies and fossil fuel inventories are valued primarily using the weighted-average cost method. Stored gas inventory is valued using the
weighted-average cost method, except for East Ohio gas distribution operations, which are valued using the LIFO method. Under the LIFO method, current stored gas inventory was valued at $9 million and $13 million at
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Based on the average price of gas purchased during 2017 and 2016, the cost of replacing the current portion of stored gas inventory exceeded the amount stated on a LIFO basis by
$79 million and $55 million, respectively.

Gas Imbalances

Natural gas imbalances occur when the physical amount of natural gas delivered from, or received by, a pipeline system or storage facility differs from the
contractual amount of natural gas delivered or received. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas value these imbalances due to, or from, shippers and operators at an appropriate index price at period end, subject to the terms of its tariff for
regulated entities. Imbalances are primarily settled

in-kind.

Imbalances due to Dominion Energy from other parties are reported in other current assets and imbalances that Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy
Gas owe to other parties are reported in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Goodwill

Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of April 1 and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change in
the interim that would

more-likely-than-not

reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.

ECOGNITION

In May 2014, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The core principle of this revised accounting
guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The amendments in this update also require disclosure of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. For the Companies, the revised accounting guidance is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. The Companies have completed their evaluations of the impact of this guidance and expect no significant impact on their results of

operations. However, the Companies will have offsetting increases in operating revenues and other energy-related purchases for noncash consideration related to NGLs received in consideration for
performing processing and fractionation services and offsetting decreases in operating revenues and purchased gas for fuel retained to offset costs on certain transportation and storage arrangements. The Companies will apply the standard using the
modified retrospective method as opposed to the full retrospective method.

F

INANCIAL

I

NSTRUMENTS

In January 2016, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. In
accordance with the guidance effective January 2018, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power will no longer classify equity securities as trading or

available-for-sale

securities. All equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, or for which it is permitted to estimate fair value using NAV (or its equivalent), including those held in Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear
decommissioning trusts and Dominion Energy’s rabbi trusts, will be reported at fair value in nuclear decommissioning trust funds and other investments, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, Dominion Energy and Virginia
Power may elect a measurement alternative for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value. Under the measurement alternative, equity securities will be reported at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in Virginia Power’s nuclear decommissioning trusts will be
recorded to a regulatory liability for certain jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation. For all other equity securities, including those held in Dominion Energy’s merchant generation nuclear decommissioning trusts and rabbi trusts, net
realized and unrealized gains and losses will be included in other income. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power will qualitatively assess equity securities reported using the measurement alternative to evaluate whether the investment is impaired on an
ongoing basis.

Upon adoption of this guidance for equity securities held at January 1, 2018, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power
recorded the cumulative-effect of a change in accounting principle to reclassify net unrealized gains from AOCI to retained earnings and to recognize equity securities previously categorized as cost method investments at fair value in nuclear
decommissioning trust funds in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power reclassified approximately $1.1 billion ($734 million

after-tax)

and $119 million ($73 million after-tax), respectively, of net unrealized gains from AOCI to retained earnings. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power also recorded approximately $36 million ($22
million after-tax) in net unrealized gains on equity securities previously classified as cost method investments of which $4 million was recorded to retained earnings and $32 million was recorded to regulatory liabilities for net unrealized gains
subject to cost-based regulation. The potential impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income is subject to investment price risk and is therefore difficult to reasonably estimate. If this guidance had been effective January 1, 2017, Dominion
Energy and Virginia Power would have

recorded net unrealized gains of approximately $275 million ($176 million

after-tax)

and $30 million ($19 million

after-tax),

respectively, to other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

L

EASES

In February 2016, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangements. The
update requires that a liability and corresponding

right-of-use

asset are recorded on the balance sheet for all leases, including those leases currently classified as
operating leases, while also refining the definition of a lease. In addition lessees will be required to disclose key information about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. Lessor accounting remains
largely unchanged.

The guidance is effective for the Companies’ interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019,
although it can be early adopted, with a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented for leases that commenced prior to the date of adoption.
The Companies plan to elect the proposed transition expedient which would allow the Companies to maintain historical presentation for periods before January 1, 2019. The Companies expect to elect the other practical expedients, which would
require no reassessment of whether existing contracts are or contain leases and no reassessment of lease classification for existing leases. The Companies have completed a preliminary assessment for evaluating the impact of this guidance and
anticipate that its adoption will result in a significant amount of offsetting

right-of-use

assets and liabilities on their financial position for leases in effect at
the adoption date. No material changes are expected on the Companies’ results of operations. The Companies are beginning implementation activities that primarily include accumulating contracts and lease data points in formats compatible with a
new lease management system that will assist with the initial adoption and

on-going

compliance with the standard.

In March
2017, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for the presentation of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The update requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit
costs be classified in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees, while all other components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs would be classified outside of income from
operations. In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization during construction. However, these changes will not impact the accounting by participants in a multi-employer plan. The standard also recognized that
in the event that a regulator continues to require capitalization of all net periodic benefit costs prospectively, the difference would result in recognition of a regulatory asset or liability. The guidance is effective for the Companies’
interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018, with a retrospective adoption for income statement presentation and a prospective adoption for capitalization. For costs not capitalized for which regulators are expected to
provide recovery, a regulatory asset will be established. As such, the amounts eligible for capitalization in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas, as subsidiary participants in Dominion Energy’s
multi-employer plans will differ from the amounts eligible for capitalization in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Dominion Energy, the plan administrator. These differences will result in a regulatory asset or liability recorded in the

EFORM

In December 2017, the staff of the SEC issued guidance which clarifies accounting for income taxes if information is not yet available or complete and
provides for up to a one-year measurement period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting. The guidance describes three scenarios associated with a company’s status of accounting for income tax reform: (1) a company is
complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform, (2) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (3) a company is not able to
determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply accounting for income taxes based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the 2017 Tax Reform Act being enacted. In addition, the guidance provides
clarification related to disclosures for entities which are utilizing the measurement period. The Companies have recorded their best estimate of the impacts of the 2017 Tax Reform Act as discussed above and in Note 5. The amounts are considered
to be provisional and may result in adjustments to be recognized during the measurement period.

In February 2018, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance to provide clarification on the
application of the 2017 Tax Reform Act for balances recorded within AOCI. The revised guidance provides for stranded amounts within AOCI from the impacts of the 2017 Tax Reform Act to be reclassified to retained earnings. The guidance is effective
for the Companies’ interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively upon adoption. If the Companies had adopted this guidance for the period ended
December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy would have reclassified a benefit of $165 million from AOCI to retained earnings, Dominion Energy Gas would have reclassified a benefit of $26 million from AOCI to membership interests and Virginia Power would have
reclassified an expense of $13 million from AOCI to retained earnings.

approximately $1.7 billion of costs related to the V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 new nuclear development project and approximately $180 million to purchase the Columbia Energy Center power station. In addition, SCANA’s debt, which
currently totals approximately $7.0 billion, is expected to remain outstanding.

The transaction requires approval of SCANA’s
shareholders, FERC and the NRC and clearance from the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. In February 2018, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. In
January 2018, SCANA and Dominion Energy filed for review and approval, as required, from the South Carolina Commission, the North Carolina Commission, the Georgia Public Service Commission and the NRC. Dominion Energy is not required to accept an
order by the South Carolina Commission approving Dominion Energy’s merger with SCANA if such order contains any material change to the terms, conditions or undertakings set forth in the cost recovery plan related to the V.C. Summer Units 2 and
3 new nuclear development project or any significant changes to the economic value of the cost recovery plan. In addition, the SCANA Merger Agreement provides that Dominion Energy will have the right to refuse to close the merger if there shall have
occurred any substantive change in the Base Load Review Act or other laws governing South Carolina public utilities which has or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on SCE&G. The SCANA Merger Agreement
con-

tains certain termination rights for both Dominion Energy and SCANA, and provides that, upon termination of the SCANA Combination under specified circumstances, Dominion Energy would be required
to pay a termination fee of $280 million to SCANA and SCANA would be required to pay Dominion Energy a termination fee of $240 million. Subject to receipt of SCANA shareholder and any required regulatory approvals and meeting closing
conditions, Dominion Energy targets closing by the end of 2018.

Acquisition of Dominion Energy Questar

In September 2016, Dominion Energy completed the Dominion Energy Questar Combination and Dominion Energy Questar, a Rockies-based integrated natural gas
company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy. Dominion Energy Questar included Questar Gas, Wexpro and Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline at closing. Questar Gas has regulated gas distribution operations in Utah, southwestern
Wyoming and southeastern Idaho. Wexpro develops and produces natural gas from reserves supplied to Questar Gas under a

cost-of-service

framework. Dominion Energy
Questar Pipeline provides FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transportation and storage services in Utah, Wyoming and western Colorado. The Dominion Energy Questar Combination provides Dominion Energy with pipeline infrastructure that provides a
principal source of gas supply to Western states. Dominion Energy Questar’s regulated businesses also provide further balance between Dominion Energy’s electric and gas operations.

In accordance with the terms of the Dominion Energy Questar Combination, at closing, each share of issued and outstanding Dominion Energy
Questar common stock was converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share in cash. The total consideration was $4.4 billion based on 175.5 million shares of Dominion Energy Questar outstanding at closing.

Dominion Energy financed the Dominion Energy Questar Combination through the: (1) August 2016 issuance of $1.4 billion of 2016
Equity Units, (2) August 2016 issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes, (3) September 2016 borrowing of $1.2 billion under a term loan agreement and (4) $500 million of the proceeds from the April 2016 issuance of common
stock. See Notes 17 and 19 for more information.

LLOCATION

Dominion Energy Questar’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed were measured at estimated fair value at the closing date and are included in the Gas
Infrastructure operating segment. The majority of operations acquired are subject to the rate-setting authority of FERC, as well as the Utah Commission and/or the Wyoming Commission and therefore are accounted for pursuant to ASC 980,

Regulated
Operations

. The fair values of Dominion Energy Questar’s assets and liabilities subject to rate-setting and cost recovery provisions provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in
rate base. As such, the fair values of these assets and liabilities equal their carrying values. Accordingly, neither the assets and liabilities acquired, nor the pro forma financial information, reflect any adjustments related to these amounts.

The fair value of Dominion Energy Questar’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting

provisions discussed above was determined using the income approach. In addition, the fair value of Dominion Energy Questar’s 50% interest in White River Hub, accounted for under the equity
method, was determined using the market approach and income approach. The valuations are considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant judgmental and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of
future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows and future market prices.

The excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill at the closing date. The goodwill reflects the value associated with enhancing Dominion Energy’s regulated portfolio of
businesses, including the expected increase in demand for

low-carbon,

natural

gas-fired

generation in the Western states and the expected continued growth of
rate-regulated businesses located in a defined service area with a stable regulatory environment. The goodwill recognized is not deductible for income tax purposes, and as such, no deferred taxes have been recorded related to goodwill.

The table below shows the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at closing which reflects the
following adjustments from the preliminary valuation recognized during the measurement period. During the fourth quarter of 2016, certain modifications were made to preliminary valuation amounts for acquired property, plant and equipment, current
liabilities, and deferred income taxes, resulting in a $6 million net decrease to goodwill, which related primarily to the sale of Questar Fueling Company in December 2016 as further described in the

Sale of Questar Fueling Company

. In
the third quarter of 2017, certain modifications were made to the valuation amounts for regulatory liabilities, current liabilities and deferred income taxes, resulting in a $6 million net increase to goodwill recorded in Dominion Energy’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The modifications relate primarily to the finalization of Dominion Energy Questar’s 2016 tax return for the period January 1, 2016 through the Dominion Energy Questar Combination, as well as certain regulatory
adjustments.

ATTERS

The
transaction required approval of Dominion Energy Questar’s shareholders, clearance from the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and approval from both the Utah Commission and the Wyoming Commission. In February 2016, the
Federal Trade Commission granted antitrust approval of the Dominion Energy Questar Combination under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. In May 2016, Dominion Energy Questar’s shareholders voted to approve the Dominion Energy Questar Combination. In
August 2016 and September 2016, approvals were granted by the Utah Commission and the Wyoming Commission, respectively. Information regarding the transaction was also provided to the Idaho Commission, who acknowledged the Dominion Energy Questar
Combination in October 2016, and directed Dominion Energy Questar to notify the Idaho Commission when it makes filings with the Utah Commission.

With the approval of the Dominion Energy Questar Combination in Utah and Wyoming, Dominion Energy agreed to the following:

•

Contribution of $75 million to Dominion Energy Questar’s qualified and

non-qualified

defined-benefit pension plans and its other post-employment benefit plans within six
months of the closing date. This contribution was made in January 2017.

•

Increasing Dominion Energy Questar’s historical level of corporate contributions to charities by $1 million per year for at least five years.

•

Withdrawal of Questar Gas’ general rate case filed in July 2016 with the Utah Commission and agreement to not file a general rate case with the Utah Commission to adjust its base distribution

non-gas

rates prior to July 2019, unless otherwise ordered by the Utah Commission. In addition, Questar Gas agreed not to file a general rate case with the Wyoming Commission with a requested rate effective date
earlier than January 2020. Questar Gas’ ability to adjust rates through various riders is not affected.

In October 2016, Dominion Energy entered into the
Contribution Agreement under which Dominion Energy contributed Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline to Dominion Energy Midstream. Upon closing of the agreement on December 1, 2016, Dominion Energy Midstream became the owner of all of the
issued and outstanding membership interests of Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline in exchange for consideration consisting of Dominion Energy Midstream common and convertible preferred units with a combined value of $467 million and cash payment
of $823 million, $300 million of which is considered a debt-financed distribution, for a total of $1.3 billion. In addition, under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Dominion Energy Midstream repurchased 6,656,839 common
units from Dominion Energy, and repaid its $301 million promissory note to Dominion Energy in December 2016. The cash proceeds from these transactions were utilized in December 2016 to repay the $1.2 billion term loan agreement
borrowed in September 2016. Since Dominion Energy consolidates Dominion Energy Midstream for financial reporting purposes, the transactions associated with the Contribution Agreement were eliminated upon consolidation. See Note 5 for the tax impacts

In June 2015, Dominion Energy acquired 50% of the units in Four Brothers from SunEdison for $64 million of consideration, consisting of
$2 million in cash and a $62 million payable. Dominion Energy had no remaining obligation related to this payable at December 31, 2016. Four Brothers operates four solar projects located in Utah, which produce and sell electricity and
renewable energy credits. The facilities began commercial operations during the third quarter of 2016, generating 320 MW, at a cost of approximately $670 million.

In September 2015, Dominion Energy acquired 50% of the units in Three Cedars from SunEdison for $43 million of consideration,
consisting of $6 million in cash and a $37 million payable. There was a $2 million payable included in other current liabilities in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016. Dominion has no
remaining obligation related to this payable at December 31, 2017. Three Cedars operates three solar projects located in Utah, which produce and sell electricity and renewable energy credits. The facilities began commercial operations during
the third quarter of 2016, generating 210 MW, at a cost of approximately $450 million.

The Four Brothers and Three Cedars
facilities operate under long-term power purchase, interconnection and operation and maintenance agreements. Dominion Energy claimed 99% of the federal investment tax credits on the projects.

Dominion Energy owns 50% of the voting interests in Four Brothers and Three Cedars and has a controlling financial interest over the
entities through its rights to control operations. The allocation of the $64 million purchase price for Four Brothers resulted in $89 million of property, plant and equipment and $25 million of noncontrolling interest. The allocation
of the $43 million purchase price for Three Cedars resulted in $65 million of property, plant and equipment and $22 million of noncontrolling interest. The noncontrolling interest for each entity was measured at fair value using the
discounted cash flow method, with the primary components of the valuation being future cash flows (both incoming and outgoing) and the discount rate. Dominion Energy determined its discount rate based on the cost of capital a utility-scale investor
would expect, as well as the cost of capital an individual project developer could achieve via a combination of nonrecourse project financing and outside equity partners. The acquired assets of Four Brothers and Three Cedars are included in the
Power Generation operating segment.

Dominion Energy has assumed the majority of the agreements to provide administrative and support
services in connection with operations and maintenance of the facilities and technical management services of the solar facilities. Costs related to services to be provided under these agreements were immaterial for the years ended December 31,
2017, 2016 and 2015.

In November 2016, NRG acquired the 50% of units in Four Brothers and Three Cedars previously held by SunEdison.
Subsequent to Dominion Energy’s acquisition of Four Brothers and Three Cedars, SunEdison and NRG made contributions to Four Brothers and Three Cedars of $301 million in aggregate through December 31, 2017, which are reflected as
noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Dominion Energy Midstream Acquisition of Interest in Iroquois

In September 2015, Dominion Energy Midstream acquired from NG and NJNR a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, which owns and operates a

416-mile,

FERC-regulated natural gas transmission pipeline in New York and Connecticut. In exchange for this partnership interest, Dominion Energy Midstream issued 8.6 million common units representing limited
partnership interests in Dominion Energy Midstream (6.8 million common units to NG for its 20.4% interest and 1.8 million common units to NJNR for its 5.53% interest). The investment was recorded at $216 million based on the value of
Dominion Energy Midstream’s common units at closing. These common units are reflected as noncontrolling interest in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion Energy Midstream’s noncontrolling partnership interest
is reflected in the Gas Infrastructure operating segment. In addition to this acquisition, Dominion Energy Gas currently holds a 24.07% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. Dominion Energy Midstream and Dominion Energy Gas each account
for their interest in Iroquois as an equity method investment. See Notes 9 and 15 for more information regarding Iroquois.

Acquisition of DECG

In January 2015, Dominion Energy completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of DECG from SCANA for $497 million in cash, as adjusted for
working capital. DECG owns and operates nearly 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia. This acquisition supports Dominion Energy’s natural gas expansion into the southeastern
U.S. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in $277 million of net property, plant and equipment, $250 million of goodwill, of which approximately $225 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, and
$38 million of regulatory liabilities. The goodwill reflects the value associated with enhancing Dominion Energy’s regulated gas position, economic value attributable to future expansion projects as well as increased opportunities for
synergies. The acquired assets of DECG are included in the Gas Infrastructure operating segment.

On March 24, 2015, DECG converted
to a limited liability company under the laws of South Carolina and changed its name from Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation to DECG. On April 1, 2015, Dominion Energy contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of
DECG to Dominion Energy Midstream in exchange for total consideration of $501 million, as adjusted for working capital. Total consideration to Dominion Energy consisted of the issuance of a

two-year,

$301 million senior unsecured promissory note payable by Dominion Energy Midstream at an annual interest rate of 0.6%, and 5,112,139 common units, valued at $200 million, representing limited partner interests in Dominion Energy Midstream.
The number of units was based on the volume weighted average trading price of Dominion Energy Midstream’s common units for the ten trading days prior to April 1, 2015, or $39.12 per unit. Since Dominion Energy consolidates Dominion Energy
Midstream for financial reporting purposes, this transaction was

Acquisition of Solar
Projects

In December 2015, Virginia Power completed the acquisition of 100% of a solar development project in North Carolina from Morgans Corner for
$47 million, all of which was allocated to property, plant and equipment. The project was placed into service in December 2015 with a total cost of $49 million, including the initial acquisition cost. The project generates 20 MW. The
output generated by the project is used to meet a ten-year

non-jurisdictional

supply agreement with the U.S. Navy, which has the unilateral option to extend for an additional ten years. In October 2015, the
North Carolina Commission granted the transfer of the existing CPCN from Morgans Corner to Virginia Power. The acquired asset is included in the Power Generation operating segment.

Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of

tax-related

assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. The Companies are routinely audited by federal and state tax
author-

ities. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to

tax-related

assets and liabilities could be material.

The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes a broad
range of tax reform provisions affecting the Companies as discussed in Note 2. The 2017 Tax Reform Act reduces the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. At the date of enactment, deferred tax
assets and liabilities were remeasured based upon the new 21% enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are realized or settled. The specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the 2017 Tax Reform Act generally
allows for the continued deductibility of interest expense, changes the tax depreciation of certain property acquired after September 27, 2017, and continues certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits.

In December 2015, U.S. federal legislation was enacted, providing an extension of the 50% bonus depreciation allowance for qualifying
expenditures incurred in 2015, 2016 and 2017. In addition, the legislation extended the 30% investment tax credit for qualifying expenditures incurred through 2019 and provides a phase down of the credit to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021 and 10% in 2022
and thereafter.

As indicated in Note 2, certain of the Companies’ operations, including accounting for income taxes, is subject to
regulatory accounting treatment. For regulated operations, many of the changes in deferred taxes represent amounts probable of collection from or refund to customers, and are recorded as either an increase to a regulatory asset or liability. The
2017 Tax Reform Act includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential refunds of other deferred taxes may be determined by state and
federal regulators. See Note 13 for more information.

The Companies have completed or have made a reasonable estimate for the measurement
and accounting of certain effects of the 2017 Tax Reform Act which have been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The changes in deferred taxes were recorded as either an increase to a regulatory liability or as an adjustment to the
deferred tax provision.

The items reflected as provisional amounts are related to accelerated depreciation for tax purposes of certain
property acquired and placed into service after September 27, 2017 and the impact of accelerated depreciation on state income taxes to the extent there is uncertainty on conformity to the new federal tax system.

The determination of the income tax effects of the items reflected as provisional amounts represents a reasonable estimate, but will require
additional analysis of historical records and further interpretation of the 2017 Tax Reform Act from yet to be issued U.S. Department of Treasury regulations, which will require more time, information and resources than currently available to the
Companies.

The accounting for the reduction in the corporate income tax rate decreased deferred income tax expense by
$851 million at Dominion Energy, $93 million at Virginia Power, and $197 million for Dominion Energy Gas for the year ending December 31, 2017. The decrease in deferred income taxes at Dominion Energy primarily relates to the
remeasurement of deferred taxes on merchant operations and includes the effects at Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas. Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas have certain regulatory assets and liabilities that have not yet been charged or
returned to customers through rates, or on which they do not earn a return, including unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits. The remeasurement of the deferred taxes on these regulatory balances was charged to continuing operations
in 2017. For ratemaking purposes, Dominion Energy Gas’ subsidiary DETI follows the cash method on pension contributions. Deferred taxes recorded on pension balances as required by GAAP are not included as a component of rates and therefore the
remeasurement of these deferred taxes were charged to continuing operations in 2017.

In 2016, Dominion Energy realized a taxable gain
resulting from the contribution of Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline to Dominion Energy Midstream. The contribution and related transactions resulted in increases in the tax basis of Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline’s assets and the number of
Dominion Energy Midstream’s common and convertible preferred units held by noncontrolling interests. The direct tax effects of the transactions included a provision for current income taxes ($212 million) and an offsetting benefit for deferred
income taxes ($96 million) and were charged to common shareholders’ equity. The federal tax liability was reduced by $129 million of tax credits generated in 2016 that otherwise would have resulted in additional credit carryforwards and a
$17 million benefit provided by the domestic production activities deduction. These benefits, as indirect effects of the contribution transaction, were reflected in Dominion Energy’s 2016 current federal income tax expense.

In 2015, Dominion Energy’s current federal income tax benefit includes the recognition of a $20 million benefit related to a
carryback to be filed for nuclear decommissioning expenditures included in its 2014 net operating loss.

For continuing operations
including noncontrolling interests, the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to the Companies’ effective income tax rate as follows:

In 2017, the Companies’ effective tax rates reflect the net benefit of remeasurement of deferred taxes
resulting from the lower corporate income tax rate promulgated by the 2017 Tax Reform Act, and the completion of audits by state tax authorities that resulted in the recog-

nition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. At December 31, 2016, Virginia Power’s unrecognized tax benefits included state refund claims for open tax years through 2011. Management
believed settlement of the claims, including interest thereon, within the next twelve months was remote. In June 2017, Virginia Power received and accepted a cash offer to settle the refund claims. As a result of the settlement, Virginia Power
decreased its unrecognized tax benefits by $8 million, and recognized a $2 million tax benefit, which impacted its effective tax rate. Also in connection with this settlement, Virginia Power realized interest income of $11 million,
which is reflected in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In 2016, Dominion Energy’s effective tax rate reflects
a valuation allowance on a state credit not expected to be utilized by a Dominion Energy subsidiary which files a separate state return.

The Companies’ deferred income taxes consist of the following:

The most significant impact reflected for the 2017 Tax Reform Act is the adjustment of the net
accumulated deferred income tax liability for the reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21%. In addition to amounts recognized in deferred income tax expense, the impacts of the 2017 Tax Reform Act decreased the accumulated deferred income
tax liability by $3.1 billion at Dominion Energy, $1.9 billion at Virginia Power and $0.8 billion at Dominion Energy Gas at December 31, 2017. At Dominion Energy, the December 31, 2017 balance sheet reflects the impact of the
2017 Tax Reform Act on our regulatory liabilities which increased our regulatory liabilities by $4.2 billion, and created a corresponding deferred tax asset of $1.1 billion. At Virginia Power, our regulatory liabilities increased
$2.6 billion, and created a deferred tax asset of $0.7 billion. At Dominion Energy Gas, our regulatory liabilities increased $1.0 billion, and created a deferred tax asset of $0.2 billion. These adjustments had no impact on 2017
cash flows.

Certain unrecognized tax benefits, or portions thereof, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations. For Dominion Energy and its subsidiaries, these unrecognized tax
benefits were $31 million, $45 million and $69 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For Dominion Energy, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits decreased income tax expense by $9 million,
$18 million and $6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For Virginia Power, these unrecognized tax benefits were $3 million, $9 million, and $8 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For
Virginia Power, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits decreased income tax expense by $6 million in 2017 and increased income tax expense by $1 million and less than $1 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. For Dominion
Energy Gas, these unrecognized tax benefits were less than $1 million, $5 million and $19 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For Dominion Energy Gas, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits decreased
income tax expense by $5 million, $11 million and less than $1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Dominion Energy participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process which provides the opportunity to resolve complex tax matters with
the IRS before filing its federal income tax returns, thus achieving certainty for such tax return filing positions agreed to by the IRS. In 2016 and 2017, the Companies submitted research credit claims for tax years 2012-2016. These claims are
currently under IRS examination. With the exception of these research credit claims, the IRS has completed its audit of tax years through

2015. The statute of limitations has not yet expired for tax years after 2012. Although Dominion Energy
has not received a final letter indicating no changes to its taxable income for tax year 2016, no material adjustments are expected. The IRS examination of tax year 2017 is ongoing.

It is reasonably possible that settlement negotiations and expiration of statutes of limitations could result in a decrease in unrecognized
tax benefits in 2018 by up to $13 million for Dominion Energy, $2 million for Virginia Power and less than $1 million for Dominion Energy Gas. If such changes were to occur, other than revisions of the accrual for interest on tax

underpayments and overpayments, earnings could increase by up to $12 million for Dominion Energy, $2 million for Virginia Power and less than $1 million for Dominion Energy Gas.

Otherwise, with regard to 2017 and prior years, Dominion Energy, Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas cannot estimate the range of
reasonably possible changes to unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in 2018.

For each of the major states in which Dominion Energy
operates, the earliest tax year remaining open for examination is as follows:

The Companies are also
obligated to report adjustments resulting from IRS settlements to state tax authorities. In addition, if Dominion Energy utilizes operating losses or tax credits generated in years for which the statute of limitations has expired, such amounts are
generally subject to examination.

EASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. However, the use of a

mid-market

pricing convention (the

mid-point

between bid and ask prices) is permitted. Fair values are
based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in valuation techniques and the inputs to valuations. This includes not only the credit standing of
counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements but also the impact of the Companies’ own nonperformance risk on their liabilities. Fair value measurements assume that the transaction occurs in the principal market for the asset
or liability (the market with the most volume and activity for the asset or liability from the perspective of the reporting entity), or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability (the market in
which the reporting entity would be able to maximize the amount received or minimize the amount paid). Dominion Energy applies fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities including commodity, interest rate, and foreign currency
derivative instruments, and other investments including those held in nuclear decommissioning, Dominion Energy’s rabbi, and pension and other postretirement benefit plan trusts, in accordance with the requirements discussed above. Virginia
Power applies fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities including commodity and interest rate derivative instruments and other investments including those held in the nuclear decommissioning trust, in accordance with the requirements
discussed above. Dominion Energy Gas applies fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities including commodity, interest rate, and foreign currency derivative instruments and other investments
includ-



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

ing those held in pension and other postretirement benefit plan trusts, in accordance with the requirements described above. The Companies apply credit adjustments to their derivative fair values
in accordance with the requirements described above.

Inputs and Assumptions

The Companies maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is based on
actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, price information is sought from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by
brokers and other pricing services, the Companies consider whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a
particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates
of fair value. In those cases the Companies must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and certain statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect their market assumptions.

The Companies’ commodity derivative valuations are prepared by Dominion Energy’s ERM department. The ERM department creates daily

mark-to-market

valuations for the Companies’ derivative transactions using computer-based statistical models. The inputs that go into the market valuations are
transactional information stored in the systems of record and market pricing information that resides in data warehouse databases. The majority of forward prices are automatically uploaded into the data warehouse databases from various third-party
sources. Inputs obtained from third-party sources are evaluated for reliability considering the reputation, independence, market presence, and methodology used by the third-party. If forward prices are not available from third-party sources, then
the ERM department models the forward prices based on other available market data. A team consisting of risk management and risk quantitative analysts meets each business day to assess the validity of market prices and

mark-to-market

valuations. During this meeting, the changes in

mark-to-market

valuations
from period to period are examined and qualified against historical expectations. If any discrepancies are identified during this process, the

mark-to-market

valuations
or the market pricing information is evaluated further and adjusted, if necessary.

For options and contracts with option-like
characteristics where observable pricing information is not available from external sources, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power generally use a modified Black-Scholes Model that considers time value, the volatility of the underlying commodities and
other relevant assumptions when estimating fair value. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power use other option models under special circumstances, including a Spread Approximation Model when contracts include different commodities or commodity locations
and a Swing Option Model when contracts allow either the buyer or seller the ability to exercise within a range of quantities. For contracts with unique characteristics, the Companies may estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow approach
deemed appropriate in the circumstances and applied

consistently from period to period. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a significant effect on the contract’s estimated fair value.

The inputs and assumptions used in measuring fair value include the following:

For commodity derivative contracts:

•

Forward commodity prices

•

Transaction prices

•

Price volatility

•

Price correlation

•

Volumes

•

Commodity location

•

For investments:

•

•

•

•

•

Credit quality

The Companies regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to estimate fair
value by a number of methods, including review and verification of models, as well as various market price verification procedures such as the use of pricing services and multiple broker quotes to support the market price of the various commodities
and investments in which the Companies transact.

Levels

The
Companies also utilize the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:

•

Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that they have
the ability to access at the measurement date. Instruments categorized in Level 1 primarily consist of financial instruments such as certain exchange-traded derivatives, and exchange-listed equities, U.S. and international equity securities,
mutual funds and certain Treasury securities held in nuclear decommissioning



trust funds for Dominion Energy and Virginia Power, benefit plan trust funds for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas, and rabbi trust funds for Dominion Energy.

•

Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or
other means. Instruments categorized in Level 2 primarily include commodity forwards and swaps, interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt instruments, government securities and other fixed income
investments held in nuclear decommissioning trust funds for Dominion Energy and Virginia Power, benefit plan trust funds for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas and rabbi trust funds for Dominion Energy.

•

Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Instruments categorized in Level 3 for the Companies
consist of long-dated commodity derivatives, FTRs, certain natural gas and power options and other modeled commodity derivatives.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data
(Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the
applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Alternative investments,
consisting of investments in partnerships, joint ventures and other alternative investments held in nuclear decommissioning and benefit plan trust funds, are generally valued using NAV based on the proportionate share of the fair value as determined
by reference to the most recent audited fair value financial statements or fair value statements provided by the investment manager adjusted for any significant events occurring between the investment manager’s and the Companies’
measurement date. Alternative investments recorded at NAV are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

For derivative contracts, the
Companies recognize transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 based on fair values as of the first day of the month in which the transfer occurs. Transfers out of Level 3 represent assets and liabilities that were previously
classified as Level 3 for which the inputs became observable for classification in either Level 1 or Level 2. Because the activity and liquidity of commodity markets vary substantially between regions and time periods, the
availability of observable inputs for substantially the full term and value of the Companies’

over-the-counter

derivative contracts is subject to change.

Level 3 Valuations

Fair value measurements are categorized as Level 3 when price or other inputs that are considered to be unobservable are significant to their valuations.
Long-dated commodity derivatives are generally based on unobservable inputs due to the length of time to settlement and the absence of market activity and are therefore categorized as Level 3. FTRs are categorized as Level 3 fair value
measurements because the only relevant pricing available comes from ISO auctions, which are generally not considered to be liquid markets. Other modeled commodity derivatives have unobservable inputs in their valuation, mostly due to

non-transparent

and illiquid markets.

The Companies enter into certain physical and financial forwards,
futures, options and swaps, which are considered Level 3 as they have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation. The discounted cash flow method is used to value Level 3 physical and financial forwards
and futures contracts. An option model is used to value Level 3 physical and financial options. The discounted cash flow model for forwards and futures calculates

mark-to-market

valuations based on forward market prices, original transaction prices, volumes, risk-free rate of return, and credit spreads. The option model calculates

mark-to-market

valuations using variations of the Black-Scholes option model. The inputs into the models are the forward market prices, implied price volatilities,
risk-free rate of return, the option expiration dates, the option strike prices, the original sales prices, and volumes. For Level 3 fair value measurements, certain forward market prices and implied price volatilities are considered
unobservable. The unobservable inputs are developed and substantiated using historical information, available market data, third-party data, and statistical analysis. Periodically, inputs to valuation models are reviewed and revised as needed, based
on historical information, updated market data, market liquidity and relationships, and changes in third-party pricing sources.

GREEMENT

In October 2017, Dominion Energy entered into a guarantee agreement in connection with Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s obligation under a $3.4 billion
revolving credit facility. See Note 22 for

more information about the guarantee agreement associated with Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s revolving credit facility. Dominion Energy recorded a liability of $30 million, the fair value
of the guarantee at inception, associated with the guarantee agreement. The fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow method and is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of a significant unobservable input
related to the interest rate differential between the interest rate charged on the guaranteed revolving credit facility and the estimated interest rate that would have been charged had the loan not been guaranteed.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

Fair value measurements are

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Substantially all of the Companies’ financial instruments are recorded at fair value, with the exception of the instruments described below, which are
reported at historical cost. Estimated fair values have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies considered appropriate by management. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash (which is
recorded in other current assets), customer and other receivables, affiliated receivables, short-term debt, affiliated current borrowings, payables to affiliates and accounts payable are representative of fair value because of the short-term nature
of these instruments. For the Companies’ financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, the carrying amounts and estimated fair values are as follows:

Fair value is estimated using market prices, where available, and interest rates currently available for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. All fair value measurements are classified as
Level 2. The carrying amount of debt issues with short-term maturities and variable rates refinanced at current market rates is a reasonable estimate of their fair value.

(2)

Carrying amount includes amounts which represent the unamortized debt issuance costs, discount or premium, and foreign currency remeasurement adjustments. At December 31, 2017, and 2016, includes the valuation
of certain fair value hedges associated with Dominion Energy’s fixed rate debt of $(22) million and $(1) million, respectively.

CTIVITIES

The Companies are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity,
natural gas and other energy-related products they market and purchase, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks of their business operations. The Companies use derivative instruments to manage exposure to these risks, and
designate certain derivative instruments as fair value or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. As discussed in Note 2, for jurisdictions subject to cost-based rate regulation, changes in the fair value of derivatives are deferred as regulatory
assets or regulatory liabilities until the related transactions impact earnings. See Note 6 for further information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives.

Derivative assets and liabilities are presented gross on the Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dominion Energy’s derivative
contracts include both

over-the-counter

transactions and those that are executed on an exchange or other trading platform (exchange contracts) and centrally cleared.
Virginia Power’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ derivative contracts include

over-the-counter

transactions.

Over-the-counter

contracts are bilateral contracts that are transacted directly with a third party. Exchange contracts utilize a financial intermediary, exchange, or
clearinghouse to enter, execute, or clear the transactions. Certain

over-the-counter

and exchange contracts contain contractual rights of setoff through master netting
arrangements, derivative clearing agreements, and contract default provisions. In addition, the contracts are subject to conditional rights of setoff through counterparty nonperformance, insolvency, or other conditions.

In general, most

over-the-counter

transactions and all
exchange contracts are subject to collateral requirements. Types of collateral for

over-the-counter

and exchange contracts include cash, letters of credit, and, in some
cases, other forms of security, none of which are subject to restrictions. Cash collateral is used in the table below to offset derivative assets and liabilities. Certain accounts receivable and accounts payable recognized on the Companies’
Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as letters of credit and other forms of security, all of which are not included in the tables below, are subject to offset under master netting or similar arrangements and would reduce the net exposure. See Note
23 for further information regarding credit-related contingent features for the Companies derivative instruments.

Ineffectiveness and AOCI

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, gains or losses on hedging instruments determined to be ineffective and amounts excluded from the
assessment of effectiveness were not material. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness include gains or losses attributable to changes in the time value of options and changes in the differences between spot prices and forward prices.

The following table presents selected information related to gains (losses) on cash flow
hedges included in AOCI in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017:

The amounts that will be reclassified from AOCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of
the hedged transactions (e.g., anticipated sales) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies and will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in
market prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

Ineffectiveness and AOCI

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, gains or losses on hedging instruments determined to be ineffective were not material.

The following table presents selected information related to losses on cash flow hedges included in AOCI in
Virginia Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017:

The amounts that will be reclassified from AOCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of
the hedged transactions (e.g., interest payments) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of interest rates contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies and will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of
changes in interest rates.

$56 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, included in other income in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Dominion Energy received distributions from these investments of $419 million, $104 million and
$83 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of Dominion Energy’s investments exceeded its share of underlying equity in net assets by $249 million and $260 million,
respectively. These differences are comprised at both December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $176 million, reflecting equity method goodwill that is not being amortized and at December 31, 2017 and 2016, of $73 million and $84 million
related to basis differences from Dominion Energy’s investments in Blue Racer and wind projects, which are being amortized over the useful lives of the underlying assets, and in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which is being amortized over the term of
the credit facility.

Dominion Energy Gas’ equity earnings on its investment totaled $21 million in 2017 and 2016 and
$23 million in 2015. Dominion Energy Gas received distributions from its investment of $24 million, $22 million and $28 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of
Dominion Energy Gas’ investment exceeded its share of underlying equity in net assets by $8 million. The difference reflects equity method goodwill and is not being amortized. In May 2016, Dominion Energy Gas sold 0.65% of the
noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois to TransCanada for approximately $7 million, which resulted in a $5 million ($3 million

after-tax)

gain, included in other income in Dominion
Energy Gas’ Consolidated Statements of Income.

IPELINE

In September 2014, Dominion Energy, along with Duke and Southern Company Gas, announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline
partnership agreement includes provisions to allow Dominion Energy an option to purchase additional ownership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline to maintain a leading ownership percentage. In October 2016, Dominion Energy purchased an additional 3%
membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline from Duke for $14 million. As of December 31, 2017, the members hold the following membership interests: Dominion Energy, 48%; Duke, 47%; and Southern Company Gas, 5%.

Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately

600-mile

natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina. Subsidiaries and affiliates of all three members plan to be customers of the pipeline under

20-year

contracts. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc. also plans to be a customer of the pipeline under a

20-year

contract. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is
considered an equity method investment as Dominion Energy has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. See Note 15 for more information.

DETI provides services to Atlantic Coast Pipeline which totaled $129 million, $95 million and $74 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, included in operating revenue in Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts receivable related to these services were $12 million and $10 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, composed entirely of accrued unbilled revenue, included in other receivables in Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In October 2017, Dominion Energy entered into a guarantee agreement to support a portion of Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s obligation under
its credit facility. See Note 22 for more information.

Dominion Energy contributed $310 million, $184 million and
$38 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to Atlantic Coast Pipeline.

Dominion Energy received distributions of
$270 million in 2017 from Atlantic Coast Pipeline. No distributions were received in 2016 or 2015.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of
$126 million ($76 million

after-tax)

in other income in its Consolidated Statements of Income reflecting its share of a long-lived asset impairment of property, plant and equipment recorded by
NedPower, which resulted in losses in excess of Dominion Energy’s investment balance. Dominion Energy recorded the excess losses due to its commitment to provide further financial support for NedPower, resulting in a liability of
$17 million recorded to other deferred credits and other liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As a result of the
impairment recorded by NedPower, Dominion Energy evaluated its equity method investment in Fowler Ridge, a similar wind-powered merchant generation facility, determined its fair value was other than-temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment
charge of $32 million ($20 million

after-tax)

in other income in its Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of $81 million was estimated using a discounted cash flow method and is
considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs related to the timing and amount of future equity distributions based on the investee’s future wind generation and operating costs.

in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisition of Solar Projects

In September 2017, Virginia Power entered into agreements to acquire two solar development projects in North Carolina. The first acquisition is expected to
close prior to the project commencing commercial operations, which is expected by the end of 2018, and cost approximately $140 million once constructed, including the initial acquisition cost. The second acquisition is expected to close prior
to the project commencing commercial operations, which is expected by the end of 2019, and cost approximately $140 million once constructed, including the initial acquisition cost. The projects are expected to generate approximately 155 MW
combined. Virginia Power anticipates claiming federal investment tax credits on these solar projects.

Assignment of Tower Rental Portfolio

Virginia Power rents space on certain of its electric transmission towers to various wireless carriers for communications antennas and other equipment.
In March 2017, Virginia Power sold its rental portfolio to Vertical Bridge Towers II, LLC for $91 million in cash. The proceeds are subject to Virginia Power’s FERC-regulated tariff, under which it is required to return half of the
proceeds to customers. Virginia Power recognized $11 million during 2017, with the remaining $35 million to be recognized ratably through 2023.

Assignments of Shale Development Rights

In December 2013, Dominion
Energy Gas closed on agreements with two natural gas producers to convey over time approximately 100,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights underneath several of its natural gas storage fields. The agreements provide for payments to
Dominion Energy Gas, subject to customary



adjustments, of approximately $200 million over a period of nine years, and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. In 2013, Dominion Energy Gas received
approximately $100 million in cash proceeds. In 2014, Dominion Energy Gas received $16 million in additional cash proceeds resulting from post-closing adjustments. In March 2015, Dominion Energy Gas and one of the natural gas producers
closed on an amendment to the agreement, which included the immediate conveyance of approximately 9,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights and a

two-year

extension of the term of the original
agreement. The conveyance of development rights resulted in the recognition of $43 million ($27 million

after-tax)

of previously deferred revenue to operations and maintenance expense in Dominion
Energy Gas’ Consolidated Statements of Income. In April 2016, Dominion Energy Gas and the natural gas producer closed on an amendment to the agreement, which included the immediate conveyance of a 32% partial interest in the remaining
approximately 70,000 acres. This conveyance resulted in the recognition of the remaining $35 million ($21 million

after-tax)

of previously deferred revenue to operations and maintenance expense in
Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Statements of Income. In August 2017, Dominion Energy Gas and the natural gas producer signed an amendment to the agreement, which included the finalization of contractual matters on previous conveyances, the
conveyance of Dominion Energy Gas’ remaining 68% interest in approximately 70,000 acres and the elimination of Dominion Energy Gas’ overriding royalty interest in gas produced from all acreage. Dominion Energy Gas will receive total
consideration of $130 million, with $65 million received in 2017 and $65 million to be received by the end of the third quarter of 2018 in connection with the final conveyance. As a result of this amendment, in 2017, Dominion Energy
Gas recognized a $56 million ($33 million

after-tax)

gain included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the
finalization of the contractual matters on previous conveyances, a $9 million ($5 million

after-tax)

gain included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Energy Gas’
Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the elimination of its overriding royalty interest and expects to recognize an approximately $65 million ($47 million

after-tax)

gain associated with
the final conveyance of acreage.

In November 2014, Dominion Energy Gas closed an agreement with a natural gas producer to convey over
time approximately 24,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields. The agreement provided for payments to Dominion Energy Gas, subject to customary adjustments, of approximately $120 million
over a period of four years, and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. In November 2014, Dominion Energy Gas closed on the agreement and received proceeds of $60 million associated with an initial conveyance of
approximately 12,000 acres. In connection with that agreement, in 2016, Dominion Energy Gas conveyed a 50% interest in approximately 4,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights and received proceeds of $10 million and an overriding
royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. These transactions resulted in a $10 million ($6 million

after-tax)

gain. In July 2017, in connection with the existing agreement, Dominion Energy
Gas conveyed an
addi-

tional 50% interest in approximately 2,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights and received proceeds of $5 million and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the
acreage. This transaction resulted in a $5 million ($3 million

after-tax)

gain. The gains are included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Statements
of Income. In January 2018, Dominion Energy Gas and the natural gas producer closed on an amendment to the agreement, which included the conveyance of Dominion Energy Gas’ remaining 50% interest in approximately 18,000 acres and the elimination
of Dominion Energy Gas’ overriding royalty interest in gas produced from all acreage. Dominion Energy Gas received proceeds of $28 million, resulting in an approximately $28 million ($20 million

after-tax)

gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018.

In March 2015, Dominion Energy Gas
conveyed to a natural gas producer approximately 11,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields and received proceeds of $27 million and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from
the acreage. This transaction resulted in a $27 million ($16 million

after-tax)

gain, included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Statements of
Income.

In September 2015, Dominion Energy Gas closed on an agreement with a natural gas producer to convey approximately 16,000 acres of
Utica and Point Pleasant Shale development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields. The agreement provided for a payment to Dominion Energy Gas, subject to customary adjustments, of $52 million and an overriding royalty interest
in gas produced from the acreage. In September 2015, Dominion Energy Gas received proceeds of $52 million associated with the conveyance of the acreage, resulting in a $52 million ($29 million

after-tax)

gain, included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Statements of Income.

Sale of Certain Retail
Energy Marketing Assets

In October 2017, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement to sell certain assets associated with its nonregulated retail
energy marketing operations for total consideration of $143 million, subject to customary approvals and certain adjustments. In December 2017, the first phase of the agreement closed for $79 million, which resulted in the recognition of a
$78 million ($48 million

after-tax)

benefit, included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Dominion Energy is expected to recognize
a benefit of approximately $65 million ($48 million

after-tax)

in other operations and maintenance expense upon closing of the second phase of the agreement in 2018. Pursuant to the agreement,
Dominion Energy entered into a commission agreement with the buyer upon the first closing in December 2017 under which the buyer will pay a commission in connection with the right to use Dominion Energy’s brand in marketing materials and other
services over a

ten-year

term.

Regulatory Matters Involving Potential Loss Contingencies

As a
result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in various regulatory matters. Certain regulatory matters may ultimately result in a loss; however, as such matters are in an initial procedural phase, involve
uncertainty as to the outcome of pending reviews or orders, and/or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For matters for which the Companies cannot
estimate a range of possible loss, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the regulatory process such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible
loss. For regulatory matters for which the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. Any estimated range is
based on currently available information, involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties and may not represent the Companies’ maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such regulatory matters will change from time to
time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current matters not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the outcome from such matters would have a material effect on the Companies’
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public
util-

ities. Dominion Energy’s merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM, MISO, CAISO and

ISO-NE

wholesale markets, and to wholesale purchasers in the
states of Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana, Connecticut, Tennessee, Georgia, California, South Carolina and Utah, under Dominion Energy’s market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC or pursuant to FERC authority to sell as a qualified
facility. Virginia Power purchases and, under its FERC market-based rate authority, sells electricity in the wholesale market. In addition, Virginia Power has FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded
cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Power’s service territory. Any such sales would be voluntary.

Rates

In April 2008, FERC granted an application for
Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January 1, 2008. The formula rate is
designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current return on its growing
investment in electric transmission infrastructure.

In March 2010, ODEC and North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation filed a
complaint with FERC against Virginia Power claiming, among other issues, that the incremental costs of undergrounding certain transmission line projects were unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential and should be excluded from
Virginia Power’s transmission formula rate. A settlement of the other issues raised in the complaint was approved by FERC in May 2012.

In March 2014, FERC issued an order excluding from Virginia Power’s transmission rates for wholesale transmission customers located
outside Virginia the incremental costs of undergrounding certain transmission line projects. FERC found it is not just and reasonable for

non-Virginia

wholesale transmission customers to be allocated the
incremental costs of undergrounding the facilities because the projects are a direct result of Virginia legislation and Virginia Commission pilot programs intended to benefit the citizens of Virginia. The order is retroactively effective as of March
2010 and will cause the reallocation of the costs charged to wholesale transmission customers with loads outside Virginia to wholesale transmission customers with loads in Virginia. FERC determined that there was not sufficient evidence on the
record to determine the magnitude of the underground increment and held a hearing to determine the appropriate amount of undergrounding cost to be allocated to each wholesale transmission customer in Virginia.

In October 2017, FERC issued an order determining the calculation of the incremental costs of undergrounding the transmission projects and
affirming that the costs are to be recovered from the wholesale transmission customers with loads located in Virginia. FERC directed Virginia Power to rebill all wholesale transmission customers retroactively to March 2010 within 30 days of when the
proceeding becomes final and no longer subject to rehearing. In November 2017, Virginia Power, North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation and the
whole-



sale transmission customers filed petitions for rehearing. While Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the matter, it is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations.

PJM Transmission Rates

In April 2007, FERC issued
an order regarding its transmission rate design for the allocation of costs among PJM transmission customers, including Virginia Power, for transmission service provided by PJM. For new

PJM-planned

transmission facilities that operate at or above 500 kV, FERC established a PJM regional rate design where customers pay according to each customer’s share of the region’s load. For recovery of costs of existing facilities, FERC approved
the existing methodology whereby a customer pays the cost of facilities located in the same zone as the customer. A number of parties appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

In August 2009, the court issued its decision affirming the FERC order with regard to the existing facilities, but remanded to FERC the issue
of the cost allocation associated with the new facilities 500 kV and above for further consideration by FERC. On remand, FERC reaffirmed its earlier decision to allocate the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above according to the customer’s
share of the region’s load. A number of parties filed appeals of the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In June 2014, the court again remanded the cost allocation issue to FERC. In December 2014, FERC issued an order
setting an evidentiary hearing and settlement proceeding regarding the cost allocation issue. The hearing only concerns the costs of new facilities approved by PJM prior to February 1, 2013. Transmission facilities approved after
February 1, 2013 are allocated on a hybrid cost allocation method approved by FERC and not subject to any court review.

In June
2016, PJM, the PJM transmission owners and state commissions representing substantially all of the load in the PJM market submitted a settlement to FERC to resolve the outstanding issues regarding this matter. Under the terms of the settlement,
Virginia Power would be required to pay approximately $200 million to PJM over the next 10 years. Although the settlement agreement has not been accepted by FERC, and the settlement is opposed by a small group of parties to the proceeding,
Virginia Power believes it is probable it will be required to make payment as an outcome of the settlement. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, Virginia Power has a contingent liability of $231 million in other deferred credits and other
liabilities, which is offset by a $222 million regulatory asset for the amount that will be recovered through retail rates in Virginia.

In July 2017, FERC audit
staff communicated to DETI that it had substantially completed an audit of DETI’s compliance with the accounting and reporting requirements of FERC’s Uniform System of Accounts and provided a description of matters and preliminary
recommendations. In November 2017, the FERC audit staff issued its audit report which could have the potential to result in adjustments which could be material to Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ results of operations. In December 2017,
DETI provided its response to the audit report. DETI requested FERC review of contested findings and submitted its plan for compliance with the uncontested portions of the report. In connection with one uncontested issue, DETI

recognized a charge of $15 million ($9 million

after-tax)

recorded within other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Energy’s and
Dominion Energy Gas’ Consolidated Statements of Income during 2017 to

write-off

the balance of a regulatory asset, originally established in 2008, that is no longer considered probable of recovery.
Pending final resolution of the audit process and a determination by FERC, management is unable to estimate the potential impact of the other findings and no amounts have been recognized.

Subsequent to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the Companies’ state regulators issued orders requesting that public utilities evaluate the total
tax impact on the entity’s cost of service and accrue a regulatory liability attributable to the benefits of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. Certain of the orders requested that the public utilities submit a response to the
state regulatory commissions detailing the total tax impact on the utility’s cost of service.

Virginia Power submitted a response to
the North Carolina Commission detailing the impact of the 2017 Tax Reform Act on base non-fuel cost of service and Virginia Power’s excess deferred income taxes clarifying that the amounts have been deferred to a regulatory liability. Questar
Gas submitted a response to the Utah Commission detailing the impact of the 2017 Tax Reform Act on base rates and the infrastructure rider, and proposing that the benefits be passed back to customers. These filings are pending. Dominion Energy plans
to respond to the remaining state regulatory commissions in accordance with the due dates on the issued orders. The Companies will begin to reserve the impacts of the cost of service reduction as a regulatory liability beginning in 2018 until the
rates are reset.

To date, the FERC has not issued guidance on how and when to reflect the impacts of the 2017 Tax Reform Act in customer
rates.

The Companies have recorded a reasonable estimate of net income taxes refundable through future rates in the jurisdictions in
which they operate. Through actions by FERC or state regulators the estimates may be subject to changes that could have a material impact on the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

The Regulation Act enacted in 2007 instituted a

cost-of-service

rate model, ending Virginia’s planned transition to retail competition for electric supply service to most classes of customers.

The Regulation Act authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation projects, FERC-approved
transmission costs, underground distribution lines, environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs, and also contains statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to file annual fuel cost
recovery cases with the Virginia Commission. As amended, it provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures on specific newly-proposed generation projects.

If the Virginia Commission’s future rate decisions, including actions relating to Virginia Power’s rate adjustment clause filings,



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

differ materially from Virginia Power’s expectations, it may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Regulation Act Legislation

In February 2015, the
Virginia Governor signed legislation into law which will keep Virginia Power’s base rates unchanged until at least December 1, 2022. In addition, no biennial reviews will be conducted by the Virginia Commission for the five successive

12-month

test periods beginning January 1, 2015, and ending December 31, 2019. The legislation states that Virginia Power’s 2015 biennial review, filed in March 2015, would proceed for the sole
purpose of reviewing and determining whether any refunds are due to customers based on earnings performance for generation and distribution services during the 2013 and 2014 test periods. In addition, the legislation requires the Virginia Commission
to conduct proceedings in 2017 and 2019 to determine the utility’s ROE for use in connection with rate adjustment clauses and requires utilities to file integrated resource plans annually rather than biennially. In November 2015, the Virginia
Commission ordered testimony, briefs and a separate bifurcated hearing in Virginia Power’s then-pending Rider B, R, S, and W cases on whether the Virginia Commission can adjust the ROE applicable to these rate adjustment clauses prior to
2017. In February 2016, the Virginia Commission issued final orders in these cases, stating that it could adjust the ROE for the projects. After separate, additional bifurcated hearings, the Virginia Commission issued final orders setting base
ROEs for the Rider GV, C1A and C2A, BW,

US-2

and U cases.

In February 2016, certain industrial
customers of APCo petitioned the Virginia Commission to issue a declaratory judgment that Virginia legislation enacted in 2015 keeping APCo’s base rates unchanged until at least 2020 (and Virginia Power’s base rates unchanged until at
least 2022) is unconstitutional, and to require APCo to make biennial review filings in 2016 and 2018. Virginia Power intervened to support the constitutionality of this legislation. In July 2016, the Virginia Commission held in a divided
opinion that this legislation is constitutional, and the industrial customers appealed this order to the Supreme Court of Virginia. In November 2016, the Supreme Court of Virginia granted the appeal as a matter of right and consolidated it for
oral argument with other similar appeals from the Virginia Commission’s order. In September 2017, the Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed that the legislation is constitutional.

In March 2017, as required by Regulation Act legislation enacted in February 2015, Virginia Power filed an application for the Virginia
Commission to determine the general ROE for Virginia Power’s

non-transmission

rate adjustment clauses. The application supported a 10.5% ROE for these rate adjustment clauses. In November 2017, the
Virginia Commission approved a general 9.2% ROE for these rate adjustment clauses.

2015 Biennial Review

In November 2015, the Virginia Commission issued the 2015 Biennial Review Order. After deciding several contested regulatory earnings adjustments, the
Virginia Commission ruled that Virginia Power earned on average an ROE of approximately 10.89% on its generation and distribution services for the combined 2013 and 2014 test periods. Because this ROE was more than 70 basis points above Virginia
Power’s authorized ROE of

10.0%, the Virginia Commission ordered that approximately $20 million in excess earnings be credited to customer bills based on usage in 2013 and 2014 over a

six-month

period beginning within 60 days of the 2015 Biennial Review Order.

Virginia Fuel Expenses

In May 2017, Virginia Power submitted its annual fuel factor to the Virginia Commission to recover an estimated $1.6 billion in Virginia jurisdictional
projected fuel expenses for the rate year beginning July 1, 2017. Virginia Power’s proposed fuel rate represented a fuel revenue increase of $279 million when applied to projected kilowatt-hour sales for the period July 1, 2017
to June 30, 2018. In June 2017, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power’s proposed fuel rate.

Solar Facility Projects

In February 2017, Virginia Power received approval from the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to construct and operate the Remington solar
facility and related distribution interconnection facilities. The 20 MW facility began operations in October 2017 at a total cost of $45 million, excluding financing costs. The facility is the subject of a public-private partnership
whereby the Commonwealth of Virginia, a

non-jurisdictional

customer, compensates Virginia Power for the facility’s net electrical energy output, and Microsoft Corporation purchases all environmental
attributes (including renewable energy certificates) generated by the facility. There is no rate adjustment clause associated with this CPCN, nor will any costs of the project be recovered from jurisdictional customers.

In March 2017, Virginia Power received Virginia Commission approval for a CPCN to construct and operate the Oceana solar
facility and related distribution interconnection facilities. The 18 MW facility began operations in December 2017 at a total cost of $40 million, excluding financing costs. The facility is the subject of a public-private partnership
whereby the Commonwealth of Virginia, a

non-jurisdictional

customer, compensates Virginia Power for the facility’s net electrical energy output. Virginia Power will retire renewable energy
certificates on the Commonwealth of Virginia’s behalf in an amount equal to those generated by the facility. There is no rate adjustment clause associated with the facility, nor will any of its costs be recovered from jurisdictional
customers.

Rate Adjustment Clauses

Below is a
discussion of significant riders associated with various Virginia Power projects:

•

The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider T1 concerning transmission rates. In May 2017, Virginia Power proposed a $625 million total revenue requirement consisting of $490 million for the transmission
component of Virginia Power’s base rates and $135 million for Rider T1. This total revenue requirement represents a $55 million decrease versus the revenues to be produced during the rate year under current rates. In July 2017, the
Virginia Commission approved the proposed total revenue requirement, including Rider T1, subject to

true-up,

for the rate year beginning September 1, 2017.

•

The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider B in conjunction with the conversion of three power stations to biomass. In February 2017, the Virginia Commission approved a $27 million revenue requirement for
the rate year beginning April 1, 2017. It also established an 11.4% ROE effective April 1, 2017. In June 2017, Virginia Power proposed a $42 million revenue requirement for the rate year beginning April 1, 2018, which represents
a $15 million increase over the previous year. This case is pending.

•

The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider U in conjunction with cost recovery to move certain electric distribution facilities underground as authorized by prior Virginia legislation. In September 2017, the
Virginia Commission approved a total $22 million annual revenue requirement effective October 1, 2017, using a 9.4% ROE, and a total capital investment of $40 million for second phase conversions.

•

The Virginia Commission previously approved Riders C1A and C2A in connection with cost recovery for DSM programs. In June 2017, the Virginia Commission approved a $28 million revenue requirement, subject to

true-up,

for the rate year beginning July 1, 2017. It also established a 9.4% ROE for Riders C1A and C2A effective July 1, 2017. In October 2017, Virginia Power requested approval to extend one
existing energy efficiency program for five years with a new $25 million cost cap, and proposed a total $31 million revenue requirement for the rate year beginning July 1, 2018, which represents a $3 million increase over the
previous year. This case is pending.

•

The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider BW in conjunction with Brunswick County. In April 2017, the Virginia Commission established a 10.4% ROE for Rider BW effective September 1, 2017. In June 2017, it

true-up,

for the rate year beginning September 1, 2017. In October 2017, Virginia Power proposed a $15 million revenue requirement for the rate year beginning September 1, 2018, which represents
a $5 million increase over the previous year. This case is pending.

•

The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider GV in conjunction with Greensville County. In February 2017, the Virginia Commission approved an $82 million revenue requirement, subject to

true-up,

for the rate year beginning April 1, 2017. It also established a 9.4% ROE effective April 1, 2017. In February 2018, the Virginia Commission approved an $82 million revenue requirement, subject to
true-up, for the rate year beginning April 1, 2018. It also established a 9.2% ROE effective April 1, 2018.

Electric Transmission
Projects

In November 2013, the Virginia Commission issued an order granting Virginia Power a CPCN to construct approximately 7 miles of new overhead
500 kV transmission line from the existing Surry switching station in Surry County to a new Skiffes Creek switching station in James City County, and approximately 20 miles of new 230 kV transmission line in James City County, York County, and the
City of Newport News from the proposed new Skiffes Creek switching station to Virginia Power’s existing Whealton substation in the City of Hampton. As of July 2017, Virginia Power has received all major required permits and approvals and is
proceeding with construction of the project. In connection with the receipt of the permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in July 2017, Virginia Power was required to make payments totaling approximately $90 million to fund improvements
to historical and cultural resources near the project. Accordingly, in July 2017, Virginia Power recorded an increase to property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability for these payment obligations. Through December 31, 2017,
Virginia Power had made $90 million of such payments. Also in July 2017, the National Parks Conservation Association filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit seeking to set aside the permit granted by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers for the project and requested a preliminary injunction against the permit. In August 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Preservation Virginia filed a similar lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit. In
October 2017, the preliminary injunction requests were denied. These lawsuits are pending.

In November 2015, Virginia Power filed an
application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to convert an existing transmission line to 230 kV in Prince William County, Virginia, and Loudoun County, Virginia, and to construct and operate a new



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

approximately five mile overhead 230 kV double circuit transmission line between a tap point near the Gainesville substation and a new

to-be-constructed

Haymarket substation. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $55 million. In April 2017, the Virginia Commission issued an interim order instructing Virginia Power to
construct and operate the project along an approved route if Virginia Power could obtain all necessary

rights-of-way.

Otherwise, the Virginia Commission ruled that
Virginia Power can construct and operate the project along an approved alternative route. In June 2017, the Virginia Commission issued a final order approving the alternative route for the project, and granted the necessary CPCN. In July 2017, the
Virginia Commission retained jurisdiction over the case to evaluate two requests to reconsider its decisions. Also in July 2017, Virginia Power requested that the Virginia Commission stay the proceeding while Virginia Power discusses the proposed
route with leaders of Prince William County. In December 2017, the Virginia Commission granted in part the two motions for reconsideration, retained jurisdiction for further proceedings in the case and stayed the effectiveness of its final order.
This matter is pending.

In November 2015, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to construct and
operate in multiple Virginia counties an approximately 38 mile overhead 230 kV transmission line between the Remington and Gordonsville substations, along with associated facilities. In August 2017, the Virginia Commission granted a CPCN for the
project. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $105 million.

In March 2016, Virginia Power filed an application
with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to rebuild and operate in multiple Virginia counties approximately 33 miles of the existing 500 kV transmission line between the Cunningham switching station and the Dooms substation, along with associated
station work. In May 2017, the Virginia Commission granted a CPCN to construct and operate the project. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $60 million.

In August 2016, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to rebuild and operate in multiple Virginia
counties approximately 28 miles of the existing 500 kV transmission line between the Carson switching station and a terminus located near the Rogers Road switching station under construction in Greensville County, Virginia, along with associated
work at the Carson switching station. In March 2017, the Virginia Commission granted a CPCN to construct and operate the project. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $55 million.

In January 2017, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to rebuild and rearrange its Idylwood substation
in Fairfax County, Virginia. In September 2017, the Virginia Commission granted a CPCN for the project. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $110 million.

In June 2017, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to rebuild and operate in Prince William County,
Virginia, approximately 9 miles of existing 115 kV transmission lines between Possum Point Switching Station and NOVEC’s Smoketown delivery point, utilizing 230 kV design on the majority of the route, for total estimated cost of approximately
$20 million. In February 2018, the Virginia Commission granted a CPCN for the project.

In September 2017, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN
to rebuild and operate in Augusta County, Virginia approximately 18 miles of the existing 500 kV transmission line between the Dooms substation and the Valley substation, along with associated substation work, for a total estimated cost of
approximately $65 million. This case is pending.

In November 2017, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission
for a CPCN to build and operate in Fairfax County, Virginia approximately 4 miles of 230 kV transmission line between the Idylwood and Tysons substations, along with associated substation work. The total estimated cost of the project is
approximately $125 million. This case is pending.

In February 2016, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission
for a CPCN to rebuild and operate in Lancaster County, Virginia and Middlesex County, Virginia and across the Rappahannock River, approximately 2 miles of existing 115 kV transmission lines between Harmony Village Substation and White Stone
Substation. In December 2017, the Virginia Commission granted a CPCN for the project to be constructed under the Rappahannock River. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $85 million.

North Anna

Virginia Power is considering the
construction of a third nuclear unit at a site located at North Anna nuclear power station. If Virginia Power decides to build a new unit, it would require a COL from the NRC, approval of the Virginia Commission and certain environmental permits and
other approvals. In June 2017, the NRC issued the COL. Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit at North Anna nuclear power station.

Requests by BREDL for a contested NRC hearing on Virginia Power’s COL application were dismissed, and in September 2016, the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit dismissed with prejudice petitions for judicial review that BREDL and other organizations had filed challenging the NRC’s reliance on a rule generically assessing the environmental impacts of continued onsite
storage of spent nuclear fuel in various licensing proceedings, including Virginia Power’s COL proceeding. This dismissal followed the Court’s June 2016 decision in New York v. NRC, upholding the NRC’s continued storage rule and
August 2016 denial of requests for rehearing en banc. Therefore, the contested portion of the COL proceeding was closed. The NRC is required to conduct a hearing in all COL proceedings. This mandatory NRC hearing was held in March 2017, was
uncontested and the resulting NRC decision authorized issuance of the COL.

In August 2016, Virginia Power received a

60-day

notice of intent to sue from the Sierra Club alleging Endangered Species Act violations. The notice alleges that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to conduct adequate environmental and consultation
reviews, related to a potential third nuclear unit located at North Anna, prior to issuing a CWA section 404 permit to Virginia Power in September 2011. No lawsuit was filed and in November 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers suspended the section 404
permit while it gathered additional information. The section 404 permit was reinstated in April 2017.

PIR Program

In 2008, East Ohio began PIR, aimed at
replacing approximately 25% of its pipeline system. In March 2015, East Ohio filed an application with the Ohio Commission requesting approval to extend the PIR program for an additional five years and to increase the annual capital investment, with
corresponding increases in the annual rate-increase caps. In September 2016, the Ohio Commission approved a stipulation filed jointly by East Ohio and the Staff of the Ohio Commission to settle East Ohio’s pending application. As
requested, the PIR program and associated cost recovery will continue for another five-year term, calendar years 2017 through 2021, and East Ohio will be permitted to increase its annual capital expenditures to $200 million by 2018 and
3% per year thereafter subject to the cost recovery rate increase caps proposed by East Ohio.

In April 2017, the Ohio Commission
approved East Ohio’s application to adjust the PIR cost recovery rates for 2016 costs. The filing reflects gross plant investment for 2016 of $188 million, cumulative gross plant investment of $1.2 billion and a revenue requirement of
$157 million.

AMR Program

In 2007, East Ohio
began installing automated meter reading technology for its 1.2 million customers in Ohio. The AMR program approved by the Ohio Commission was completed in 2012. Although no further capital investment will be added, East Ohio is approved
to recover depreciation, property taxes, carrying charges and a return until East Ohio has another rate case.

In April 2017, the Ohio
Commission approved East Ohio’s application to adjust its AMR cost recovery rate for 2016 costs. The filing reflects a revenue requirement of approximately $6 million.

PIPP Plus Program

Under the Ohio PIPP Plus Program,
eligible customers can make reduced payments based on their ability to pay their bill. The difference between the customer’s total bill and the PIPP amount is deferred and collected under the PIPP Rider in accordance with the rules of the Ohio
Commission. In July 2017, East Ohio’s annual update of the PIPP Rider was automatically approved by the Ohio Commission after a

45-day

waiting period from the date of the filing. The revised rider rate
reflects the recovery over the twelve-month period from July 2017 through June 2018 of projected deferred program costs of approximately $19 million from April 2017 through June 2018, net of a refund for over-recovery of accumulated arrearages
of approximately $20 million as of March 31, 2017.

UEX Rider

East Ohio has approval for a UEX Rider through which it recovers the bad debt expense of most customers not participating in the PIPP Plus Program. The UEX
Rider is adjusted annually to achieve dollar for dollar recovery of East Ohio’s actual write-offs of uncollectible amounts. In September 2017, the Ohio Commission approved East Ohio’s application requesting approval of its

UEX Rider to reflect a refund of over-recovered accumulated bad debt expense of approximately $12 million as of March 31, 2017, and recovery of prospective net bad debt expense
projected to total approximately $22 million for the twelve-month period from April 2017 to March 2018.

Ohio Legislation

In March 2017, the Governor of Ohio signed legislation into law that allows utilities to file an application to recover infrastructure development costs
associated with economic development projects. The new cost recovery provision allows for projects totaling up to $22 million for East Ohio subject to Ohio Commission approval.

DSM Rider

East Ohio has approval for a DSM rider
through which it recovers expenditures related to its DSM programs. In December 2017, East Ohio filed an application with the Ohio Commission seeking approval of an adjustment to the DSM rider to recover a total of $5 million, which
includes an under-recovery of costs during the preceding 12-month period. This application is pending.

EGULATION

In October 2017, Questar Gas submitted filings with both the Utah Commission and the Wyoming Commission for an approximately $25 million gas cost
increase reflecting forecasted increases in commodity and transportation costs. The Utah Commission and the Wyoming Commission both approved the filings in October 2017 with rates effective November 2017.

FERC—G

AS

Cove Point

In November 2016, pursuant to the terms of a previous settlement, Cove Point filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with 23 proposed
rates to be effective January 1, 2017. Cove Point proposed an annual

cost-of-service

of approximately $140 million. In December 2016, FERC accepted a
January 1, 2017 effective date for all proposed rates but five which were suspended to be effective June 1, 2017. Under the terms of the settlement agreement filed by Cove Point in August 2017 and approved by FERC in November 2017, Cove
Point’s rates effective October 2017 result in decreases to annual revenues and depreciation expense of approximately $18 million and $3 million, respectively, compared to the rates in effect through December 2016.

DETI

In September 2017, DETI submitted its annual
transportation cost rate adjustment to FERC requesting approval to recover $39 million. Also in September 2017, DETI submitted its annual electric power cost adjustment to FERC requesting approval to recover $6 million. In October 2017,
FERC approved these adjustments.

AROs represent obligations that result from laws, statutes, contracts and regulations related to the eventual retirement of certain of the Companies’
long-lived assets. Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s AROs are primarily associated with the decommissioning of their nuclear generation facilities and ash pond and landfill closures. Dominion Energy Gas’ AROs primarily include
plugging and abandonment of gas and oil wells and the interim retirement of natural gas gathering, transmission, distribution and storage pipeline components.

The Companies have also identified, but not recognized, AROs related to the retirement of Dominion Energy’s LNG facility, Dominion
Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ storage wells in their underground natural gas storage network, certain Virginia Power electric transmission and distribution assets located on property with easements, rights of way, franchises and lease
agreements, Virginia Power’s hydroelectric generation facilities and the abatement of certain asbestos not expected to be disturbed in Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s generation facilities. The Companies currently do not have
sufficient information to estimate a reasonable range of expected retirement dates for any of these assets since the economic lives of these assets can be extended indefinitely through regular repair and maintenance and they currently have no
plans to retire or dispose of any of these assets. As a result, a settlement date is not determinable for these assets and AROs for these assets will not be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements until sufficient information becomes
available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the activities to be performed. The Companies continue to monitor operational and strategic developments to identify if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate a
retirement date for these assets. The changes to AROs during 2016 and 2017 were as follows:

The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE and to disclose certain information about its significant variable interests in the VIE.
The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both 1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that
could potentially be significant to the VIE.

At December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy owns the general partner, 50.6% of the common and subordinated units and 37.5% of the convertible preferred
interests in Dominion Energy Midstream, which owns a preferred equity interest and the general partner interest in Cove Point. Additionally, Dominion Energy owns the manager and 67% of the membership interest in certain merchant solar facilities, as
discussed in Note 2. Dominion Energy has concluded that these entities are VIEs due to the limited partners or members lacking the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. In addition, in 2016 Dominion Energy created a wholly owned
subsidiary, SBL Holdco, as a holding company of its interest in the VIE merchant solar facilities and accordingly SBL Holdco is a VIE. Dominion Energy is the primary beneficiary of Dominion Energy Midstream, SBL Holdco and the merchant solar
facilities, and Dominion Energy Midstream is the primary beneficiary of Cove Point, as they have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and benefits
which could be significant to them. Dominion Energy’s securities due within one year and long-term debt include $30 million and $332 million, respectively, of debt issued in 2016 by SBL Holdco net of issuance costs that is nonrecourse
to Dominion Energy and is secured by SBL Holdco’s interest in the merchant solar facilities.

Dominion Energy owns a 48% membership
interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. See Note 9 for more details regarding the nature of this entity. Dominion Energy concluded that Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a VIE because it has insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support. Dominion Energy has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of Atlantic Coast Pipeline as it does not have the power to direct the activities of Atlantic Coast Pipeline that most significantly impact its
economic performance, as the power to direct



is shared among multiple unrelated parties. Dominion Energy is obligated to provide capital contributions based on its ownership percentage. Dominion Energy’s maximum exposure to loss is
limited to its current and future investment as well as any obligations under a guarantee provided. See Note 22 for more information.

Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear

most significantly impact these VIEs’ economic performance. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are obligated to provide capital contributions to the partnerships as required by each partnership agreement based on their ownership percentages.

Dominion Energy previously concluded that
Iroquois was a VIE because a

non-affiliated

Iroquois equity holder had the ability during a limited period of time to transfer its ownership interests to another Iroquois equity holder or its affiliate. At the

Virginia Power had
long-term power and capacity contracts with five

non-utility

generators, which contain certain variable pricing mechanisms in the form of partial fuel reimbursement that Virginia Power considers to be variable
interests. Contracts with two of these

non-utility

generators expired during 2015 and two additional contracts expired during 2017, leaving a remaining aggregate summer generation capacity of approximately 218
MW. After an evaluation of the information provided by these entities, Virginia Power was unable to determine whether they were VIEs. However, the information they provided, as well as Virginia Power’s knowledge of generation facilities in
Virginia, enabled Virginia Power to conclude that, if they were VIEs, it would not be the primary beneficiary. This conclusion reflects Virginia Power’s determination that its variable interests do not convey the power to direct the most
significant activities that impact the economic performance of the remaining entity during the remaining terms of Virginia Power’s contract and for the years the entity is expected to operate after its contractual relationship expires. The
remaining contract expires in 2021. Virginia Power is not subject to any risk of loss from this potential VIE other than its remaining purchase commitments which totaled $200 million as of December 31, 2017. Virginia Power paid
$86 million, $144 million, and $200 million for electric capacity and $24 million, $31 million, and $83 million for electric energy to these entities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,

DETI has been engaged to oversee the construction of, and to subsequently operate and maintain, the projects undertaken by

Atlantic Coast Pipeline based on the overall direction and oversight of Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s members. An affiliate of DETI holds a membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline,
therefore DETI is considered to have a variable interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The members of Atlantic Coast Pipeline hold the power to direct the construction, operations and maintenance activities of the entity. DETI has concluded it is not
the primary beneficiary of Atlantic Coast Pipeline as it does not have the power to direct the activities of Atlantic Coast Pipeline that most significantly impact its economic performance. DETI has no obligation to absorb any losses of the VIE. See

Energy Gas determined that neither is the primary beneficiary of DES as neither has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and benefits which could
be significant to it. DES provides accounting, legal, finance and certain administrative and technical services to all Dominion Energy subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas. Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas have no

short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied
by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion Energy utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion Energy’s credit ratings and the credit

The weighted-average interest rates of the outstanding commercial paper supported by Dominion Energy’s credit facilities were 1.61% and 1.05% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Questar Gas’ short-term financing is supported through its access as

to the two joint revolving credit facilities discussed above with Dominion Energy, Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate

sub-limit

for Questar Gas was $250 million. In December 2016, Questar Gas entered into a commercial paper program pursuant to which it began accessing the commercial paper markets.

Dominion Energy has indicated its intention to replace the existing two joint revolving credit facilities with a $6.0 billion joint
revolving credit facility in the first quarter of 2018. Terms and covenants of the new credit facility are expected to be similar to the existing credit facilities, including that Virginia Power, Dominion Energy Gas and Questar Gas will remain
as

co-borrowers,

except that the maturity will be in five years and the maximum allowed total debt to total capital ratio, with respect to Dominion Energy only, will be increased from 65% to 67.5%. In February
2018, Virginia Power, as

co-borrower,

filed with the Virginia Commission for approval.

In
addition to the credit facilities mentioned above, SBL Holdco has $30 million of credit facilities which have an original stated maturity date of December 2017 with automatic

In February 2018, $250 million of Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline’s senior notes were repaid using proceeds from the January 2018 issuance, through private placements, of $100 million of 3.53% senior
notes and $150 million of 3.91% senior notes that mature in 2028 and 2038, respectively. As a result, at December 31, 2017, $250 million was included in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Companies short-term credit facilities and long-term debt agreements contain customary
covenants and default provisions. As of December 31, 2017, there were no events of default under these covenants.

Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes

In June 2006 and September 2006, Dominion Energy issued $300 million of June 2006 hybrids and $500 million of September 2006 hybrids,
respectively. Beginning June 30, 2016, the June 2006 hybrids bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 2.825%, reset quarterly. Previously, interest was fixed at 7.5% per year. The September 2006 hybrids bear interest at the three-month LIBOR
plus 2.3%, reset quarterly.

In October 2014, Dominion Energy issued $685 million of October 2014 hybrids that will bear interest
at 5.75% per year until October 1, 2024. Thereafter, they will bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 3.057%, reset quarterly.

Dominion Energy may defer interest payments on the hybrids on one or more occasions for up to 10 consecutive years. If the interest payments
on the hybrids are deferred, Dominion Energy may not make distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or

guarantee payments during the deferral period. Also, during the deferral period, Dominion Energy may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right
of payment with, or subordinated to, the hybrids.

Dominion Energy executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the June 2006
hybrids and the September 2006 hybrids. Under the terms of the RCCs, Dominion Energy covenants to and for the benefit of designated covered debtholders, as may be designated from time to time, that Dominion Energy shall not redeem, repurchase, or
defease all or any part of the hybrids, and shall not cause its majority owned subsidiaries to purchase all or any part of the hybrids, on or before their applicable RCC termination date, unless, subject to certain limitations, during the 180 days
prior to such activity, Dominion Energy has received a specified amount of proceeds as set forth in the RCCs from the sale of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than the applicable
characteristics of the hybrids at that time, as more fully described in the RCCs. In September 2011, Dominion Energy amended the RCCs of the June 2006 hybrids and September 2006 hybrids to expand the measurement period for consideration of proceeds
from the sale of common stock issuances from 180 days to 365 days. The pro-



ceeds Dominion Energy receives from the replacement offering, adjusted by a predetermined factor, must equal or exceed the redemption or repurchase price.

In 2015, Dominion Energy purchased and cancelled $14 million and $3 million of the June 2006 hybrids and the September 2006 hybrids,
respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, Dominion Energy purchased and cancelled $38 million and $4 million of the June 2006 hybrids and the September 2006 hybrids, respectively. In July 2016, Dominion Energy launched a tender offer to
purchase up to $200 million in aggregate of additional June 2006 hybrids and September 2006 hybrids, which expired on August 1, 2016. In connection with the tender offer, Dominion Energy purchased and cancelled $125 million and
$74 million of the June 2006 hybrids and the September 2006 hybrids, respectively. All purchases were conducted in compliance with the applicable RCC. Also in July 2016, Dominion Energy issued $800 million of 5.25% July 2016 hybrids.
The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to finance the tender offer. The July 2016 hybrids are listed on the NYSE under the symbol DRUA.

Remarketable Subordinated Notes

In June 2013, Dominion Energy
issued $550 million of 2013 Series A 6.125% Equity Units and $550 million of 2013 Series B 6.0% Equity Units, initially in the form of Corporate Units. In July 2014, Dominion Energy issued $1.0 billion of 2014 Series A 6.375% Equity
Units, initially in the form of Corporate Units. The Corporate Units were listed on the NYSE under the symbols DCUA, DCUB and DCUC respectively.

Each Corporate Unit consisted of a stock purchase contract and 1/20 interest in a RSN issued by Dominion Energy. The stock purchase contracts
obligated the holders to purchase shares of Dominion Energy common stock at a future settlement date prior to the relevant RSN maturity date. The purchase price paid under the stock purchase contracts was $50 per Corporate Unit and the number of
shares purchased was determined under a formula based upon the average closing price of Dominion Energy common stock near the settlement date. The RSNs were pledged as collateral to secure the purchase of common stock under the related stock
purchase contracts.

In May 2017, Dominion Energy successfully remarketed the $1.0 billion 2014 Series A 1.50% RSNs due 2020 pursuant
to the terms of the related 2014 Equity Units. In connection with the remarketing, the interest rate on the junior subordinated notes was reset to 2.579%, payable on a semi-annual basis and Dominion Energy ceased to have the ability to redeem the
notes at its option or defer interest payments. In March 2016 and May 2016, Dominion Energy successfully remarketed the $550 million 2013 Series A 1.07% RSNs due 2021 and the $550 million 2013 Series B 1.18% RSNs due 2019, respectively,
pursuant to the terms of the related 2013 Equity Units. In connection with the remarketings, the interest rate on the Series A and Series B junior subordinated notes was reset to 4.104% and 2.962%, respectively, payable on a semi-annual basis
and Dominion Energy ceased to have the ability to redeem the notes at its option or defer interest payments. At December 31, 2017, the securities are included in junior subordinated notes in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Dominion Energy did not receive any proceeds from the remarketings. Remarketing proceeds belonged to the

investors holding the related equity units and were temporarily used to purchase a portfolio of treasury securities. Upon maturity of each portfolio, the proceeds were applied on behalf of
investors on the related stock purchase contract settlement date to pay the purchase price to Dominion Energy for issuance of 12.5 million shares of its common stock in July 2017 and 8.5 million shares of its common stock in both April
2016 and July 2016. See Issuance of Common Stock below for a description of common stock issued by Dominion Energy under the stock purchase contracts.

In August 2016, Dominion Energy issued $1.4 billion of 2016 Series A 6.75% Equity Units, initially in the form of Corporate Units. The
Corporate Units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol DCUD. The net proceeds from the 2016 Equity Units were used to finance the Dominion Energy Questar Combination. See Note 3 for more information.

Each 2016 Series A Corporate Unit consists of a stock purchase contract, a 1/40 interest in a 2016 Series

A-1

RSN issued by Dominion Energy and a 1/40 interest in a 2016 Series

A-2

RSN issued by Dominion Energy. The stock purchase contracts obligate the holders to purchase
shares of Dominion Energy common stock at a future settlement date prior to the relevant RSN maturity date. The purchase price to be paid under the stock purchase contracts is $50 per Corporate Unit and the number of shares to be purchased will be
determined under a formula based upon the average closing price of Dominion Energy common stock near the settlement date. The RSNs are pledged as collateral to secure the purchase of common stock under the related stock purchase contracts.

Dominion Energy makes quarterly interest payments on the RSNs and quarterly contract adjustment payments on the stock purchase contracts, at
the rates described below. Dominion Energy may defer payments on the stock purchase contracts and the RSNs for one or more consecutive periods but generally not beyond the purchase contract settlement date. If payments are deferred, Dominion Energy
may not make any cash distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments. Also, during the deferral period, Dominion Energy may not make any payments on or redeem or
repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the RSNs.

Dominion Energy has recorded the
present value of the stock purchase contract payments as a liability offset by a charge to equity. Interest payments on the RSNs are recorded as interest expense and stock purchase contract payments are charged against the liability. Accretion of
the stock purchase contract liability is recorded as imputed interest expense. In calculating diluted EPS, Dominion Energy applies the treasury stock method to the equity units.

Pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Equity Units, Dominion Energy expects to remarket both the 2016 Series

A-1

and 2016 Series

A-2

RSNs during the third quarter of 2019. Following a successful remarketing, the interest rate on the RSNs will be reset, interest will be
payable on a semi-annual basis and Dominion Energy will cease to have the ability to redeem the RSNs at its option or defer interest payments. Proceeds of each remarketing will belong to the investors in the related equity units and will be held and
applied on their behalf at the settlement date of the related stock purchase contracts to pay the purchase price to Dominion Energy for issuance of its common stock.

employee savings plans through which contributions may be invested in Dominion Energy’s common stock. These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. In January 2014, Dominion
Energy began purchasing its common stock on the open market for these plans. In April 2014, Dominion Energy began issuing new common shares for these direct stock purchase plans.

During 2017, Dominion Energy received cash proceeds, net of fees and commissions, of $1.3 billion from the issuance of approximately
17 million shares of common stock through various programs resulting in approximately 645 million shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2017. These proceeds include cash of $302 million received from the issuance of
3.8 million of such shares through Dominion Energy Direct

®

and employee savings plans.

In July 2017, Dominion Energy issued 12.5 million shares under the related stock purchase contracts entered into as part of Dominion
Energy’s 2014 Equity Units and received proceeds of $1.0 billion.

In both April 2016 and July 2016, Dominion Energy issued
8.5 million shares under the related stock purchase contracts entered into as part of Dominion Energy’s 2013 Equity Units and received $1.1 billion of total proceeds. Additionally, Dominion Energy completed a market issuance of equity
in April 2016 of 10.2 million shares and received proceeds of $756 million through a registered underwritten public offering. A portion of the net proceeds was used to finance the Dominion Energy Questar Combination. See Note 3 for more
information.

In June 2017, Dominion Energy filed an SEC shelf registration for the sale of debt and equity securities including the
ability to sell common stock through an

at-the-market

program. Also in June 2017, Dominion Energy entered into three separate sales agency agreements to effect sales
under the program and pursuant to which it may offer from time to time up to $500 million aggregate amount of its common stock. Sales of common stock can be made by means of privately negotiated transactions, as transactions on the NYSE at
market prices or in such other transactions as are agreed upon by Dominion Energy and the sales agents in conformance with applicable securities laws. In January 2018, Dominion Energy provided sales instructions to one of the sales agents and has
issued 6.6 million shares through

at-the-market

issuances and received cash proceeds of $495 million, net of fees and commissions paid of $5 million.

Following these issuances, Dominion Energy has no remaining ability to issue stock under the 2017 sales agency agreements and has completed the program.

, employee stock awards, employee savings plans, director stock compensation plans and issuance in connection with stock purchase contracts. See Note 17 for more information.

Repurchase of Common Stock

Dominion Energy did not repurchase any
shares in 2017 or 2016 and does not plan to repurchase shares during 2018, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which do not count against its stock repurchase authorization.

Purchase of Dominion Energy Midstream Units

In September 2015,
Dominion Energy initiated a program to purchase from the market up to $50 million of common units representing limited partner interests in Dominion Energy Midstream, which expired in September 2016. Dominion Energy purchased approximately
658,000 common units for $17 million and 887,000 common units for $25 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Issuance of Dominion Energy Midstream Units

In 2017, Dominion
Energy Midstream received $18 million of proceeds from the issuance of common units through its

at-the-market

program.

In 2016, Dominion Energy Midstream received $482 million of proceeds from the issuance of common units and $490 million of proceeds
from the issuance of convertible preferred units. The net proceeds were primarily used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline from Dominion Energy. See Note 3 for more information.

The holders of the convertible preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly distributions payable in cash or additional
convertible preferred units, subject to certain conditions. The units are convertible into Dominion Energy Midstream common units on a

one-for-one

basis, subject to
certain adjustments, (i) in whole or in part at the option of the unitholders any time after December 1, 2018 or, (ii) in whole or in part at Dominion Energy Midstream’s option, subject to certain conditions, any time after
December 1, 2019. The conversion of such units would result in a potential increase to Dominion Energy’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Stock-Based Awards

The 2005 and
2014 Incentive Compensation Plans permit stock-based awards that include restricted stock, performance grants, goal-based stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. The

Non-Employee

Directors
Compensation Plan permits grants of restricted stock and stock options. Under provisions of these plans, employees and

non-employee

directors may be granted options to purchase common stock at a price not less
than its fair market value at the date of grant with a maximum term of eight years. Option terms are set at the discretion of the CGN Committee of the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors itself, as provided under each plan. At
December 31, 2017, approximately 23 million shares were available for future grants under these plans.

Goal-based stock awards
are granted in lieu of cash-based performance grants to certain officers who have not achieved a certain targeted level of share ownership. As of December 31,

2017, unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested goal-based stock awards was immaterial.

Dominion Energy measures and recognizes compensation expense relating to share-based payment transactions over the vesting period based on the
fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Dominion Energy’s results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 include $45 million, $33 million, and $39 million,

respectively, of compensation
costs and $16 million, $11 million, and $14 million, respectively of income tax benefits related to Dominion Energy’s stock-based compensation arrangements. Stock-based compensation cost is reported in other operations and
maintenance expense in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Excess Tax Benefits are classified as a financing cash flow.

Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas—Defined Benefit Plans

Dominion Energy provides certain retirement benefits to eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. Dominion Energy Gas participates in a
number of the Dominion Energy-sponsored retirement plans. Under the terms of its benefit plans, Dominion Energy reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plans. From time to time in the past, benefits have changed, and some of these
changes have reduced benefits.

Dominion Energy maintains qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering virtually all
employees. Retirement benefits are based primarily on years of service, age and the employee’s compensation. Dominion Energy’s funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with the provisions of ERISA. The
pension programs also provide benefits to certain retired executives under company-sponsored nonqualified employee benefit plans. The nonqualified plans are funded through contributions to grantor trusts. Dominion Energy also provides retiree
healthcare and life insurance benefits with annual employee premiums based on several factors such as age, retirement date and years of service.

Pension benefits for Dominion Energy Gas employees not represented by collective bargaining units are covered by the Dominion Energy Pension
Plan, a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by Dominion Energy that provides benefits to multiple Dominion Energy subsidiaries. Pension benefits for Dominion Energy Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units are covered by separate
pension plans for East Ohio and, for DETI, a plan that provides benefits to employees of both DETI and Hope. Employee compensation is the basis for allocating pension costs and obligations between DETI and Hope and determining East Ohio’s share
of total pension costs.

Retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits for Dominion Energy Gas employees not represented by collective
bargaining units are covered by the Dominion Retiree Health and Welfare Plan, a plan sponsored by Dominion Energy that provides certain retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits to multiple Dominion Energy subsidiaries. Retiree healthcare and
life insurance benefits for Dominion Energy Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units are covered by separate other postretirement benefit plans for East Ohio and, for DETI, a plan that provides benefits to both DETI and Hope.
Employee headcount is the basis for allocating other postretirement benefit costs and obligations between DETI and Hope and determining East Ohio’s share of total other postretirement benefit costs.

Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are affected by employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and years of
service), the level of contributions made to the plans and



earnings on plan assets. These costs may also be affected by changes in key assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates,
mortality rates and the rate of compensation increases.

Dominion Energy uses December 31 as the measurement date for all of its
employee benefit plans, including those in which Dominion Energy Gas participates. Dominion Energy uses the market-related value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets, a component of net periodic pension cost, for
all pension plans, including those in which Dominion Energy Gas participates. The market-related value recognizes changes in fair value on a straight-line basis over a four-year period, which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. Changes in fair value are measured as the difference between the expected and actual plan asset returns, including dividends, interest and realized and unrealized investment gains and
losses. Since the market-related value recognizes changes in fair value over a four-year period, the future market-related value of pension plan assets will be impacted as previously unrecognized changes in fair value are recognized.

Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Dominion
Energy’s pension and other postretirement plan assets experienced aggregate actual returns of $1.6 billion and $534 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, versus expected returns of $767 million and $691 million,
respectively. Dominion Energy Gas’ pension and other postretirement plan assets for employees represented by collective bargaining units experienced aggregate actual returns of $335 million and $130 million in 2017 and 2016,
respectively, versus expected returns of $165 million and $157 million, respectively. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related
declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the net periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans.

In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries published new mortality tables and mortality improvement scales. Such tables and scales are used to
develop mortality assumptions for use in determining pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and expense. Following evaluation of the new tables, Dominion Energy changed its assumption for mortality rates to reflect a generational
improvement scale. This change in assumption increased net periodic benefit cost for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas (for employees represented by collective bargaining units) by $25 million and $3 million, respectively, for 2015.

During 2016, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas (for employees represented by collective bargaining units) engaged their actuary to
conduct an experience study of their employees demographics over a five-year period as compared to significant assumptions that were being used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and periodic costs. These assumptions
primarily included mortality, retirement rates, termination rates, and salary increase rates. The changes in assumptions implemented as a result of the experience study resulted in increases of $290 million and $38 million in the pension
and other postretirement benefits obligations, respectively, at

December 31, 2016 for Dominion Energy and $24 million and $9 million in the pension and other postretirement benefits obligations, respectively, at December 31, 2016 for
Dominion Energy Gas. In addition, these changes increased net periodic benefit costs $42 million for Dominion Energy during 2017. The increase in net periodic benefit costs for Dominion Energy Gas during 2017 was immaterial.

MENDMENTS

AND

EMEASUREMENTS

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy remeasured its pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a result of voluntary and
involuntary separation programs at Dominion Energy Questar. The settlement and related remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the pension benefit obligation of approximately $75 million and an increase in the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation of approximately $2 million. The discount rates used for the 2017 pension cost and related settlement were 4.46% as of December 31, 2016, 4.51% as of January 31, 2017 and 4.05% as of June 30 and
September 30, 2017. All other assumptions used were consistent with the measurement as of December 31, 2016.

In the first
quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas remeasured an other postretirement benefit plan as a result of an amendment that changed

post-65

retiree medical coverage for certain current and future
Local 69 retirees effective July 1, 2017. The remeasurement resulted in a decrease in Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $73 million and $61 million, respectively. As
a result of regulatory accounting, the remeasurement had an immaterial impact on net income for both Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was 4.30%. All other assumptions used were consistent with the
measurement as of December 31, 2016.

Also during the first quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy recorded a $7 million
($4 million

after-tax)

charge, including $6 million ($4 million

after-tax)

at Dominion Energy Gas, as a result of additional payments associated with the
new collective bargaining agreement, which is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Income.

In the third quarter of 2016, Dominion Energy remeasured an other postretirement benefit plan as a result of an amendment that changed

post-65

retiree medical coverage for certain current and future Local 50 retirees effective April 1, 2017. The remeasurement resulted in a decrease in Dominion Energy’s accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation of $37 million. The impact of the remeasurement on net periodic benefit credit was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date and increased the net periodic benefit credit for 2016 by $9 million. The discount rate used
for the remeasurement was 3.71% and the demographic and mortality assumptions were updated using plan-specific studies and mortality improvement scales. The expected long-term rate of return used was consistent with the measurement as of
December 31, 2015.

The ABO for all of Dominion Energy’s defined benefit pension plans was $8.2 billion
and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The ABO for the defined benefit pension plans covering Dominion Energy Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units was $724 million and $640 million at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Under its funding policies, Dominion Energy evaluates plan funding requirements annually,
usually in the fourth quarter after receiving updated plan information from its actuary. Based on the funded status of each plan and other factors, Dominion Energy determines the amount of contributions for the current year, if any, at that time.
During 2017, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas made no contributions to the qualified defined benefit pension plans other than a $75 million contribution to Dominion Energy’s qualified pension plan to satisfy a regulatory condition
to closing of the Dominion Energy Questar Combination and no contributions are currently expected in 2018. In July 2012, the MAP 21 Act was signed into law. This Act includes an increase in the interest rates used to determine plan sponsors’
pension contributions for required funding purposes. In 2014, the HATFA of 2014 was signed into law. Similar to the MAP 21 Act, the HATFA of 2014 adjusts the rules for calculating interest rates used in determining funding obligations. It is
estimated that the new interest rates will reduce required pension contributions through 2019. Dominion Energy believes that required pension contributions will rise subsequent to 2019, resulting in an estimated $200 million reduction in net
cumulative required contributions over a

10-year

period.

Certain regulatory authorities have held
that amounts recovered in utility customers’ rates for other postretirement benefits, in excess of benefits actually paid during the year, must be deposited in trust funds dedicated for the sole purpose of paying such benefits. Accordingly,
certain of Dominion Energy’s subsidiaries, including Dominion Energy Gas, fund other postretirement benefit costs through VEBAs. Dominion Energy’s remaining subsidiaries do not prefund other postretirement benefit costs but instead pay
claims as presented. Dominion Energy’s contributions to VEBAs, all of which pertained to Dominion Energy Gas employees, totaled $12 million for both 2017 and 2016, and Dominion Energy expects to contribute approximately $12 million to
the Dominion Energy VEBAs in 2018, all of which pertains to Dominion Energy Gas employees.

Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas do not
expect any pension or other postretirement plan assets to be returned during 2018.

Dominion Energy’s overall objective for investing its pension and other postretirement plan assets is to achieve appropriate long-term rates of return
commensurate with prudent levels of risk. As a participating employer in various pension plans sponsored by Dominion Energy, Dominion Energy Gas is subject to Dominion Energy’s investment policies for such plans. To minimize risk, funds are
broadly diversified among asset classes, investment strategies and investment advisors. The strategic target asset allocations for Dominion Energy’s pension funds are 28% U.S. equity, 18%

non-U.S.

equity,
35% fixed income, 3% real estate and 16% other alternative investments. U.S. equity includes investments in

large-cap,

mid-cap

and

small-cap

companies located in the U.S.

Non-U.S.

equity includes investments in

large-cap

and

small-cap

companies located outside of the U.S. including both developed and emerging markets. Fixed income includes corporate debt instruments of companies from diversified industries and U.S. Treasuries. The
U.S. equity,

non-U.S.

equity and fixed income investments are in individual securities as well as mutual funds. Real estate includes equity real estate investment trusts and investments in partnerships. Other
alternative investments include partnership investments in private equity, debt and hedge funds that follow several different strategies.

Dominion Energy also utilizes common/collective trust funds as an investment vehicle for its defined benefit plans. A common/collective trust
fund is a pooled fund operated by a bank or trust company for investment of the assets of various organizations and



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

individuals in a well-diversified portfolio. Common/collective trust funds are funds of grouped assets that follow various investment strategies.

Strategic investment policies are established for Dominion Energy’s prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies.
Factors considered in setting the investment policy include employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the
plans’ strategic allocation are a function of Dominion Energy’s assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans’ actual asset
allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other
postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns. Financial derivatives may be used to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities.

For fair value measurement policies and procedures related to pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, see Note 6.

Excludes net assets related to pending sales of securities of $1 million, net accrued income of $2 million, and includes net assets related to pending purchases of securities of $1 million at
December 31, 2017. Excludes net assets related to pending sales of securities of $5 million, net accrued income of $2 million, and includes net assets related to pending purchases of securities of $5 million at December 31,

The Plan’s investments are determined based on the fair values of the investments and the underlying
investments, which have been determined as follows:

•

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—Investments are held primarily in short-term notes and treasury bills, which are valued at cost plus accrued interest.

•

Common and Preferred Stocks

—Investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

•

Insurance Contracts

—Investments in Group Annuity Contracts with John Hancock were entered into after 1992 and are stated at fair value based on the fair value of the underlying securities as provided by the
managers and include investments in U.S. government securities, corporate debt instruments, state and municipal debt securities.

•

Corporate Debt Instruments

—Investments are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities. This includes basing value on yields currently available on comparable
securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar instruments, the instrument is valued under a discounted cash flows approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of
similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks or a broker quote, if available.

•

Government Securities

—Investments are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities.

•

Common/Collective Trust Funds

—Common/collective trust funds invest in debt and equity securities and other instruments with characteristics similar to those of the funds’ benchmarks. The primary
objectives of the funds are to seek investment returns that approximate the overall performance of their benchmark indexes. These benchmarks are major equity indices, fixed income indices, and money market indices that focus on growth, income, and
liquidity strategies, as applicable. Investments in common/collective trust funds are stated at the NAV as determined by the issuer of the common/collective trust funds and are based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund
less its liabilities. The NAV is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. The common/collective trust funds do not have any unfunded commitments, and do not have any applicable liquidation periods or defined terms/periods to be held.
The majority of the common/collective trust funds have limited withdrawal or redemption rights during the term of the investment.

•

Alternative Investments

—Investments in real estate funds, private equity funds, debt funds and hedge funds are stated at fair value based on the NAV of the Plan’s proportionate share of the partnership,
joint venture or other alternative investment’s fair value as determined by reference to audited financial statements or NAV statements provided by the investment manager. The NAV is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and
mortality are critical assumptions in determining net periodic benefit (credit) cost. Dominion Energy develops

non-investment

related assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent
investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions used for Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement plans, including those in which Dominion Energy Gas participates, including discount
rates, expected long-term rates of return, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates.

Dominion Energy determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for its
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, including those in which Dominion Energy Gas participates, by using a combination of:

•

Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions;

•

Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes;

•

Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations;

•

Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major stock market indices; and

•

Investment allocation of plan assets.

Dominion Energy determines discount rates from analyses
of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans, including those in which Dominion Energy Gas participates.

Mortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for postretirement benefit plans. Dominion Energy’s actuary
conducts an experience study periodically as part of the process to select its best estimate of mortality. Dominion Energy considers both standard mortality tables and improvement factors as well as the plans’ actual experience when selecting a
best estimate. During 2016, Dominion Energy conducted a new experience study as scheduled and, as a result, updated its mortality assumptions for all its plans, including those in which Dominion Energy Gas participates.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for Dominion Energy’s retiree healthcare plans,
including those in which Dominion Energy Gas participates. A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects for Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ (for employees represented
by collective bargaining units) other postretirement benefit plans:

Dominion Energy Gas (Employees Not Represented by Collective Bargaining Units) and Virginia Power—Participation in Defined
Benefit Plans

Virginia Power employees and Dominion Energy Gas employees not represented by collective bargaining units are covered by the Dominion
Energy Pension Plan described above. As participating employers, Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas are subject to Dominion Energy’s funding policy, which is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with ERISA. During 2017,
Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas made no con-



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

tributions to the Dominion Energy Pension Plan, and no contributions to this plan are currently expected in 2018. Virginia Power’s net periodic pension cost related to this plan was
$110 million, $79 million and $97 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Dominion Energy Gas’ net periodic pension credit related to this plan was $(37) million, $(45) million and $(38) million in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Net periodic pension (credit) cost is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in their respective Consolidated Statements of Income. The funded status of various Dominion Energy subsidiary groups and employee compensation
are the basis for determining the share of total pension costs for participating Dominion Energy subsidiaries. See Note 24 for Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas amounts due to/from Dominion Energy related to this plan.

Retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits, for Virginia Power employees and for Dominion Energy Gas employees not represented by
collective bargaining units, are covered by the Dominion Energy Retiree Health and Welfare Plan described above. Virginia Power’s net periodic benefit (credit) cost related to this plan was $(42) million, $(29) million and $(16) million in
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Dominion Energy Gas’ net periodic benefit (credit) cost related to this plan was $(5) million, $(4) million and $(5) million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net periodic benefit (credit) cost is
reflected in other operations and maintenance expenses in their respective Consolidated Statements of Income. Employee headcount is the basis for determining the share of total other postretirement benefit costs for participating Dominion Energy
subsidiaries. See Note 24 for Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas amounts due to/from Dominion Energy related to this plan.

Dominion
Energy holds investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans in which Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas’ employees participate. Any investment-related declines in these trusts
will result in future increases in the net periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash that Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas will provide to Dominion Energy for their
shares of employee benefit plan contributions.

Certain regulatory authorities have held that amounts recovered in rates for other
postretirement benefits, in excess of benefits actually paid during the year, must be deposited in trust funds dedicated for the sole purpose of paying such benefits. Accordingly, Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas fund other postretirement
benefit costs through VEBAs. During 2017 and 2016, Virginia Power made no contributions to the VEBA and does not expect to contribute to the VEBA in 2018. Dominion Energy Gas made no contributions to the VEBAs for employees not represented by
collective bargaining units during 2017 and 2016 and does not expect to contribute in 2018.

Defined Contribution Plans

Dominion Energy also sponsors defined contribution employee savings plans that cover substantially all employees. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, Dominion Energy
recognized $45 million, $44 million and $43 million, respectively, as employer matching contributions to these plans. Dominion Energy Gas participates in these employee savings plans, both specific to Dominion Energy Gas and that
cover multiple Dominion Energy
sub-

sidiaries. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, Dominion Energy Gas recognized $7 million as employer matching contributions to these plans. Virginia Power also participates in these employee savings
plans. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, Virginia Power recognized $19 million, $19 million and $18 million, respectively, as employer matching contributions to these plans.

Organizational Design Initiative

In the first quarter of 2016, the
Companies announced an organizational design initiative that reduced their total workforces during 2016. The goal of the organizational design initiative was to streamline leadership structure and push decision making lower while also improving
efficiency. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Dominion Energy recorded a $65 million ($40 million

after-tax)

charge, including $33 million ($20 million

after-tax)

at Virginia Power and $8 million ($5 million

after-tax)

at Dominion Energy Gas, primarily reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in their
Consolidated Statements of Income due to severance pay and other costs related to the organizational design initiative. The terms of the severance under the organizational design initiative were consistent with the Companies’ existing
severance plans.

ONTINGENCIES

As a result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in legal proceedings before various courts and are periodically
subject to governmental examinations (including by regulatory authorities), inquiries and investigations. Certain legal proceedings and governmental examinations involve demands for unspecified amounts of damages, are in an initial procedural phase,
involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, such that it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For such matters for which the
Companies cannot estimate a range of possible loss, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the litigation or investigative processes such that the Companies are
able to estimate a range of possible loss. For legal proceedings and governmental examinations for which the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the
accrued liability (if any) for such matters. Any accrued liability is recorded on a gross basis with a receivable also recorded for any probable insurance recoveries. Estimated ranges of loss are inclusive of legal fees and net of any anticipated
insurance recoveries. Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the Companies’ maximum possible loss
exposure. The circumstances of such legal proceedings and governmental examinations will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current proceedings not specifically reported below,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the Companies.



Environmental Matters

The Companies are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the
environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.

A

IR

CAA

The CAA, as amended, is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation’s air quality. At a
minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies’ facilities are subject to the
CAA’s permitting and other requirements.

MATS

The MATS rule requires coal- and

oil-fired

electric utility steam generating units to meet strict emission limits for
mercury, particulate matter as a surrogate for toxic metals and hydrogen chloride as a surrogate for acid gases. Following a

one-year

compliance extension granted by VDEQ and an additional

one-year

extension under an EPA Administrative Order, Virginia Power ceased operating the coal units at Yorktown power station in April 2017 to comply with the rule. In June 2017, the DOE issued an order to PJM to
direct Virginia Power to operate Yorktown power station’s Units 1 and 2 as needed to avoid reliability issues on the Virginia Peninsula. The order was effective for 90 days and can be reissued upon PJM’s request, if necessary, until
required electricity transmission upgrades are completed approximately 23 months following the receipt in July 2017 of final permits and approvals for construction. Beginning in August 2017, PJM filed requests for

90-day

renewals of the DOE order which the DOE has granted. The current renewal is effective until March 2018. The Sierra Club has challenged the DOE order and certain renewal requests, all of which have been
denied by the DOE.

Although litigation of the MATS rule is still pending, the regulation remains in effect and Virginia Power is
complying with the applicable requirements of the rule and does not expect any adverse impacts to its operations at this time.

Ozone Standards

In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule tightening the ozone standard from

75-ppb

to

70-ppb.

To comply with this standard, in April 2016 Virginia Power submitted the NO

X

Reasonable Available Control Technology analysis for Unit 5 at Possum
Point power station. In December 2016, the VDEQ determined that NO

X

reductions are required on Unit 5. In October 2017, Virginia Power proposed to install NO

X

controls by

mid-2019

with an expected cost in the range of $25 million to $35 million.

The statutory deadline for the EPA to complete attainment designations for a new standard was October 2017. States will have three years after
final designations, certain of which were issued by the EPA in November 2017, to develop plans to address the new standard. Until the states have developed implementation plans for the standard, the Companies are unable to predict whether or to what
extent the new rules will ultimately require

additional controls. The expenditures required to implement additional controls could have a material impact on the Companies’ results of operations and cash flows.

NO

x

and VOC Emissions

In April 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued final regulations, with an effective date of January 2017, to reduce NO

X

and VOC emissions from combustion sources. To comply with the regulations, Dominion Energy Gas is installing emission control systems on existing engines at several compressor stations in
Pennsylvania. The compliance costs associated with engineering and installation of controls and compliance demonstration with the regulation are expected to be approximately $35 million.

Oil and Gas NSPS

In August 2012, the EPA issued an NSPS
impacting new and modified facilities in the natural gas production and gathering sectors and made revisions to the NSPS for natural gas processing and transmission facilities. These rules establish equipment performance specifications and emissions
standards for control of VOC emissions for natural gas production wells, tanks, pneumatic controllers, and compressors in the upstream sector. In June 2016, the EPA issued a new NSPS regulation, for the oil and natural gas sector, to regulate
methane and VOC emissions from new and modified facilities in transmission and storage, gathering and boosting, production and processing facilities. All projects which commenced construction after September 2015 are required to comply with this
regulation. In April 2017, the EPA issued a notice that it is reviewing the rule and, if appropriate, will issue a rulemaking to suspend, revise or rescind the June 2016 final NSPS for certain oil and gas facilities. In June 2017, the EPA published
notice of reconsideration and partial stay of the rule for 90 days and proposed extending the stay for two years. In July 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the

90-day

stay. In
November 2017, the EPA solicited comments on the proposed

two-year

stay of the June 2016 NSPS rules. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas are implementing the 2016 regulation. Dominion Energy and Dominion
Energy Gas are still evaluating whether potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows related to this matter will be material.

GHG R

EGULATION

Carbon Regulations

In August 2016, the EPA issued a draft rule proposing to reaffirm that a source’s obligation to obtain a PSD or Title V permit for GHGs is
triggered only if such permitting requirements are first triggered by

non-GHG,

or conventional, pollutants that are regulated by the New Source Review program, and to set a significant emissions rate at 75,000
tons per year of CO


equivalent emissions under which a source would not be required to apply BACT for its GHG emissions. Until the EPA ultimately takes final action on this rulemaking, the
Companies cannot predict the impact to their financial statements.

In addition, the EPA continues to evaluate its policy regarding the
consideration of CO


emissions from biomass projects when determining whether a stationary source meets the PSD and Title V applicability thresholds, including those for the application of



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

BACT. It is unclear how the final policy will affect Virginia Power’s Altavista, Hopewell and Southampton power stations which were converted from coal to biomass under the prior biomass
deferral policy; however, the expenditures to comply with any new requirements could be material to Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s financial statements.

Methane Emissions

In July 2015, the EPA announced the
next generation of its voluntary Natural Gas STAR Program, the Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program. The program covers the entire natural gas sector from production to distribution, with more emphasis on transparency and increased reporting
for both annual emissions and reductions achieved through implementation measures. In March 2016, East Ohio, Hope, DETI and Questar Gas joined the EPA as founding partners in the new Methane Challenge program and submitted implementation plans
in September 2016. DECG joined the EPA’s voluntary Natural Gas STAR Program in July 2016 and submitted an implementation plan in September 2016. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas do not expect the costs related to these programs to have a
material impact on their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

W

ATER

The CWA, as amended, is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to
surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. The Companies must comply with applicable aspects of the CWA programs at their operating facilities.

In October 2014, the final regulations under Section 316(b) of the CWA that govern existing facilities and new units at existing
facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold became effective. The rule establishes a national standard for impingement based on seven compliance options, but forgoes the creation of
a single technology standard for entrainment. Instead, the EPA has delegated entrainment technology decisions to state regulators. State regulators are to make

case-by-case

entrainment technology determinations after an examination of five mandatory facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test, and six
optional facility-specific factors. The rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above two MGD, with a heightened entrainment analysis for those facilities over 125 MGD. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have 13 and 11
facilities, respectively, that may be subject to the final regulations. Dominion Energy anticipates that it will have to install impingement control technologies at many of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. Dominion Energy and
Virginia Power are currently evaluating the need or potential for entrainment controls under the final rule as these decisions will be made on a

a thorough review of detailed biological, technology, cost and benefit studies. While the impacts of this rule could be material to Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the
existing regulatory framework in Virginia provides rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for Virginia Power.

In September 2015, the EPA released a final rule to revise the Effluent Limitations Guidelines
for the Steam Electric Power Generating Category. The final rule establishes updated standards for wastewater discharges that apply primarily at coal and oil steam generating stations. Affected facilities are required to convert from wet to dry or
closed cycle coal ash management, improve existing wastewater treatment systems and/or install new wastewater treatment technologies in order to meet the new discharge limits. Virginia Power has eight facilities subject to the final rule. In April
2017, the EPA granted two separate petitions for reconsideration of the Effluent Limitations Guidelines final rule and stayed future compliance dates in the rule. Also in April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the
U.S.’s request for a stay of the pending consolidated litigation challenging the rule while the EPA addresses the petitions for reconsideration. In September 2017, the EPA signed a rule to postpone the earliest compliance dates for certain
waste streams regulations in the Effluent Limitations Guidelines final rule from November 2018 to November 2020; however, the latest date for compliance for these regulations remains December 2023. The EPA is proposing to complete new rulemaking for
these waste streams. While the impacts of this rule could be material to Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory framework in Virginia provides rate
recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for Virginia Power.

EMEDIATION

The CERCLA, as amended, provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in
the event of threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the U.S. government either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons
responsible for the situation to do so. Under the CERCLA, as amended, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of contaminated sites, can be jointly, severally and strictly liable for the
cost of cleanup. These potentially responsible parties can be ordered to perform a cleanup, be sued for costs associated with an

EPA-directed

cleanup, voluntarily settle with the U.S. government concerning
their liability for cleanup costs, or voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight.

From time to
time, Dominion Energy, Virginia Power, or Dominion Energy Gas may be identified as a potentially responsible party to a Superfund site. The EPA (or a state) can either allow such a party to conduct and pay for a remedial investigation, feasibility
study and remedial action or conduct the remedial investigation and action itself and then seek reimbursement from the potentially responsible parties. These parties can also bring contribution actions against each other and seek reimbursement from
their insurance companies. As a result, Dominion Energy, Virginia Power, or Dominion Energy Gas may be responsible for the costs of remedial investigation and actions under the Superfund law or other laws or regulations regarding the remediation of
waste. The Companies do not believe these matters will have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.



Dominion Energy has determined that it is associated with 19 former manufactured gas plant
sites, three of which pertain to Virginia Power and 12 of which pertain to Dominion Energy Gas. Studies conducted by other utilities at their former manufactured gas plant sites have indicated that those sites contain coal tar and other potentially
harmful materials. None of the former sites with which the Companies are associated is under investigation by any state or federal environmental agency. At one of the former sites, Dominion Energy is conducting a state-approved post closure
groundwater monitoring program and an environmental land use restriction has been recorded. Another site has been accepted into a state-based voluntary remediation program. Virginia Power is currently evaluating the nature and extent of the
contamination from this site as well as potential remedial options. Preliminary costs for options under evaluation for the site range from $1 million to $22 million. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the other sites, the Companies are
unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts.

See below for discussion on ash pond and landfill closure costs.

Other Legal Matters

The Companies are defendants in a number
of lawsuits and claims involving unrelated incidents of property damage and personal injury. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these matters, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts; however, they
could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

Pipeline Contractor Litigation

Following the
completion of the Appalachian Gateway project in 2012, DETI received multiple change order requests and other claims for additional payments from a pipeline contractor for the project. In July 2015, the contractor filed a complaint against DETI in
U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In March 2016, the Pennsylvania court granted DETI’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In July 2016, DETI filed a motion to
dismiss. In March 2017, the court dismissed three of eight counts in the complaint. In May 2017, the contractor withdrew one of the counts in the complaint. In November 2017, DETI and the contractor entered into a partial settlement agreement for a
release of certain claims. This case is pending. At December 31, 2017, DETI has accrued a liability of $2 million for this matter. Dominion Energy Gas cannot currently estimate additional financial statement impacts, but there could be a
material impact to its financial condition and/or cash flows.

Gas Producers Litigation

In connection with the Appalachian Gateway project, Dominion Energy Field Services, Inc. entered into contracts for firm purchase rights with a group of small
gas producers. In June 2016, the gas producers filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia against Dominion Energy, DETI and Dominion Energy Field Services, Inc., among other defendants, claiming that the contracts are
unenforceable and seeking compensatory and punitive damages. During the third quarter of

2016, Dominion Energy, DETI and Dominion Energy Field Services, Inc. were served with the complaint. Also in the third quarter of 2016, Dominion Energy and DETI, with the consent of the other
defendants, removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia. In October 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand. In February 2017, the U.S. District Court
entered an order remanding the matter to the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia. In March 2017, Dominion Energy was voluntarily dismissed from the case; however, DETI and Dominion Energy Field Services, Inc. remain parties to the
matter. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the Business Court Division of West Virginia. In January 2018, the court granted the motion to dismiss filed by the defendants on two counts. All other claims are pending in the Business Court
Division of West Virginia. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas cannot currently estimate financial statement impacts, but there could be a material impact to their financial condition and/or cash flows.

OSTS

In March 2015, the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit alleging CWA violations at Chesapeake power station. In March 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia ruled that impacted groundwater associated with the

on-site

coal ash storage units was migrating to adjacent surface water, which constituted an unpermitted point source discharge in
violation of the CWA. The court, however, rejected Sierra Club’s claims that Virginia Power had violated specific conditions of its water discharge permit. Finding no harm to the environment, the court further declined to impose civil penalties
or require excavation of the ash from the site as Sierra Club had sought. In July 2017, the court issued a final order requiring Virginia Power to perform additional specific sediment, water and aquatic life monitoring at and around the Chesapeake
power station for a period of at least two years. The court further directed Virginia Power to apply for a solid waste permit from VDEQ that includes corrective measures to address

on-site

groundwater impacts.
In July 2017, Virginia Power appealed the court’s July 2017 final order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In August 2017, the Sierra Club filed a cross appeal. This case is pending.

In April 2015, the EPA enacted a final rule regulating CCR landfills, existing ash ponds that still receive and manage CCRs, and inactive ash
ponds that do not receive, but still store, CCRs. Virginia Power currently operates inactive ash ponds, existing ash ponds, and CCR landfills subject to the final rule at eight different facilities. This rule created a legal obligation for
Virginia Power to retrofit or close all of its inactive and existing ash ponds over a certain period of time, as well as perform required monitoring, corrective action, and post-closure care activities as necessary.

In 2015, Virginia Power recorded a $386 million ARO related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs, which resulted in a
$99 million incremental charge recorded in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income, a $166 million increase in property, plant and equipment associated with asset retirement costs, and a
$121 million reduction in other noncurrent liabilities from the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability since the ARO obligation created by the final CCR rule represents similar

activities. In 2016, Virginia Power recorded an increase to this ARO of $238 million, which resulted in a $197 million incremental charge recorded in other operations and maintenance expense
in its Consolidated Statement of Income, a $17 million increase in property, plant and equipment and a $24 million increase in regulatory assets.

In December 2016, legislation was enacted that creates a framework for

EPA-

approved state CCR permit
programs. In August 2017, the EPA issued interim guidance outlining the framework for state CCR program approval. The EPA has enforcement authority until state programs are approved. The EPA and states with approved programs both will have authority
to enforce CCR requirements under their respective rules and programs. In September 2017, the EPA agreed to reconsider portions of the CCR rule in response to two petitions for reconsideration. Litigation concerning the CCR rule is pending and the
EPA has submitted to the court a list of which CCR rule provisions the EPA intends to reevaluate. Virginia Power cannot forecast potential incremental impacts or costs related to existing coal ash sites in connection with future implementation of
the 2016 CCR legislation and reconsideration of the CCR rule.

In April 2017, the Virginia Governor signed legislation into law that
places a moratorium on the VDEQ issuing solid waste permits for closure of ash ponds at Virginia Power’s Bremo, Chesapeake, Chesterfield and Possum Point power stations until May 2018. The law also required Virginia Power to conduct an
assessment of closure alternatives for the ash ponds at these four stations, to include an evaluation of excavation for recycling or

off-site

disposal, surface and groundwater conditions and
safety. Virginia Power completed the assessments and provided the report on December 1, 2017. The actual AROs related to the CCR rule may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the obligation.

Dominion
Energy has constructed the Liquefaction Project at the Cove Point facility, which, once commercially operational, would enable the facility to liquefy domestically-produced natural gas and export it as LNG. In September 2014, FERC issued an order
granting authorization for Cove Point to construct, modify and operate the Liquefaction Project.

Two parties have separately filed
petitions for review of the FERC order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which petitions were consolidated. Separately, one party requested a stay of the FERC order until the judicial proceedings are complete, which the court denied
in June 2015. In July 2016, the court denied one party’s petition for review of the FERC order authorizing the Liquefaction Project. The court also issued a decision remanding the other party’s petition for review of the FERC order to FERC
for further explanation of FERC’s decision that a previous transaction with an existing import shipper was not unduly discriminatory. In September 2017, FERC issued its order on remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit,
and reaffirmed its ruling in its prior orders that Cove Point did not violate the prohibition against undue discrimination by agreeing to a capacity reduction and early contract termination with the existing import shipper. In October 2017, the
party filed a request for rehearing of the FERC order on remand. This case is pending.

In September 2013, the DOE granted

Non-FTA

Authorization approval for the export of up to 0.77 bcfe/day of natural gas to countries that do not have an FTA for trade in natural gas. In June 2016, a party filed a petition for review of this approval in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit. In November 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an order denying the petition for review.

In July 2017,
Cove Point submitted an application for a temporary operating permit to the Maryland Department of the Environment, as required prior to the date of first production of LNG for commercial purposes of exporting LNG. The permit was received in
December 2017. In February 2018, the Public Service Commission of Maryland issued an order approving Cove Point’s August 2017 application to amend the CPCN issued by the Public Service Commission of Maryland in May 2014 to make necessary
updates.

with these activities. Virginia Power has provided its response to FERC staff’s preliminary findings letter explaining why Virginia Power’s conduct was lawful and refuting any allegation of wrongdoing. Virginia Power is cooperating fully
with the investigation; however, it cannot currently predict whether or to what extent it may incur a material liability.

Virginia Power is constructing Greensville County and related transmission interconnection facilities. In August 2016, the
Sierra Club filed an administrative appeal in the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond challenging certain provisions in Greensville County’s PSD air permit issued by VDEQ in June 2016. In August 2017, the Circuit Court upheld the air

Nuclear Matters

In March
2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami caused significant damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in northeast Japan. These events have resulted in significant nuclear safety reviews required by the NRC and industry
groups such as the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. Like other U.S. nuclear operators, Dominion Energy has been gathering supporting data and participating in industry initiatives focused on the ability to respond to and mitigate the
consequences of design-basis and beyond-design-basis events at its stations.

In July 2011, an NRC task force provided initial
recommendations based on its review of the Fukushima Daiichi accident and in October 2011 the NRC staff prioritized these recommendations into Tiers 1, 2 and 3, with the Tier 1 recommendations consisting of actions which the staff determined should
be started without unnecessary delay. In December 2011, the NRC Commissioners approved the agency staff’s prioritization and recommendations, and that same month an
appropria-



tions act directed the NRC to require reevaluation of external hazards (not limited to seismic and flooding hazards) as soon as possible.

Based on the prioritized recommendations, in March 2012, the NRC issued orders and information requests requiring specific reviews and actions
to all operating reactors, construction permit holders and combined license holders based on the lessons learned from the Fukushima Daiichi event. The orders applicable to Dominion Energy requiring implementation of safety enhancements related to
mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at plants, and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation have been implemented. The information requests issued by the NRC request each reactor to
reevaluate the seismic and external flooding hazards at their site using

present-day

methods and information, conduct walkdowns of their facilities to ensure protection against the hazards in their current
design basis, and to reevaluate their emergency communications systems and staffing levels. The walkdowns of each unit have been completed, audited by the NRC and found to be adequate. Reevaluation of the emergency communications systems and
staffing levels was completed as part of the effort to comply with the orders. Reevaluation of the seismic and external flooding hazards is expected to continue through 2018. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power do not currently expect that compliance
with the NRC’s information requests will materially impact their financial position, results of operations or cash flows during the implementation period. The NRC staff is evaluating the implementation of the longer term Tier 2 and Tier 3
recommendations. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power do not expect material financial impacts related to compliance with Tier 2 and Tier 3 recommendations.

SSURANCE

The NRC requires nuclear power plant
owners to annually update minimum financial assurance amounts for the future decommissioning of their nuclear facilities. Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once
operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. The 2017 calculation for the NRC minimum financial assurance amount, aggregated for Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear units, excluding joint
owners’ assurance amounts and Millstone Unit 1 and Kewaunee, as those units are in a decommissioning state, was $2.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and has been satisfied by a combination of the funds being collected and
deposited in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the real annual rate of return growth of the funds allowed by the NRC. The 2017 NRC minimum financial assurance amounts above were calculated using preliminary December 31, 2017 U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics indices. Dominion Energy believes that the amounts currently available in its decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone and Kewaunee units.
Virginia Power also believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient to cover decommissioning costs, particularly when

combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects a positive long-term outlook
for trust fund investment returns as the decommissioning of the units will not be complete for decades. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance requirement,
which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. See Note 9 for additional information on nuclear decommissioning trust investments.

NSURANCE

The
Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 provides the public up to $13.44 billion of liability protection per nuclear incident, via obligations required of owners of nuclear power plants, and allows for an inflationary provision adjustment every
five years. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have purchased $450 million of coverage from commercial insurance pools for each reactor site with the remainder provided through a mandatory industry retrospective rating plan. In the event of a
nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear reactor in the U.S., the Companies could be assessed up to $127 million for each of their licensed reactors not to exceed $19 million per year per reactor. There is no limit to the number of
incidents for which this retrospective premium can be assessed. However, the NRC granted an exemption in March 2015 to remove Kewaunee from the Secondary Financial Protection program. The current levels of nuclear property insurance coverage for
Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear units are as follows:

Surry and North Anna share a blanket property limit of $200 million.

Dominion
Energy’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear property insurance coverage for Millstone, Surry and North Anna exceeds the NRC minimum requirement for nuclear power plant licensees of $1.06 billion per reactor site. Kewaunee meets the NRC
minimum requirement of $1.06 billion. This includes coverage for premature decommissioning and functional total loss. The NRC requires that the proceeds from this insurance be used first, to return the reactor to and maintain it in a safe and
stable condition and second, to decontaminate the reactor and station site in accordance with a plan approved by the NRC. Nuclear property insurance is provided by NEIL, a mutual insurance company, and is subject to retrospective premium assessments
in any policy year in which losses exceed the funds available to the insurance company. Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s maximum retrospective premium assessment for the current policy period is $86 million and $50 million,
respectively. Based on the severity of the incident, the Board of Directors of the nuclear insurer has the discretion to lower or eliminate the maximum retrospective premium assessment. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

the financial responsibility for any losses that exceed the limits or for which insurance proceeds are not available because they must first be used for stabilization and decontamination.

Millstone and Virginia Power also purchase accidental outage insurance from NEIL to mitigate certain expenses, including replacement power
costs, associated with the prolonged outage of a nuclear unit due to direct physical damage. Under this program, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are subject to a retrospective premium assessment for any policy year in which losses exceed funds
available to NEIL. Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s maximum retrospective premium assessment for the current policy period is $22 million and $10 million, respectively.

ODEC, a part owner of North Anna, and Massachusetts Municipal and Green Mountain, part owners of Millstone’s Unit 3, are responsible to
Dominion Energy and Virginia Power for their share of the nuclear decommissioning obligation and insurance premiums on applicable units, including any retrospective premium assessments and any losses not covered by insurance.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power entered into contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
of 1982. The DOE failed to begin accepting the spent fuel on January 31, 1998, the date provided by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and by Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s contracts with the DOE. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power
have previously received damages award payments and settlement payments related to these contracts.

By mutual agreement of the parties,
the settlement agreements are extendable to provide for resolution of damages incurred after 2013. The settlement agreements for the Surry, North Anna and Millstone plants have been extended to provide for periodic payments for damages incurred
through December 31, 2016, and have been extended to provide for periodic payment of damages through December 31, 2019. Pursuit of or possible settlement of the Kewaunee claims for damages incurred after December 31, 2013 is being
evaluated.

In 2017, Virginia Power and Dominion Energy received payments of $22 million for resolution of claims incurred at North
Anna and Surry for the period of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, and $14 million for resolution of claims incurred at Millstone for the period of July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016.

In 2016, Virginia Power and Dominion Energy received payments of $30 million for resolution of claims incurred at North Anna and Surry
for the period of January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and $22 million for resolution of claims incurred at Millstone for the period of July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015.

In 2015, Virginia Power and Dominion Energy received payments of $8 million for resolution of claims incurred at North Anna and Surry for
the period of January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, and $17 million for resolution of claims incurred at Millstone for the period of July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power continue to recognize receivables for certain spent nuclear fuel-related costs that they believe are
probable of recovery from the DOE. Dominion

Energy’s receivables for spent nuclear fuel-related costs totaled $46 million and $56 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Virginia Power’s receivables
for spent nuclear fuel-related costs totaled $30 million and $37 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Dominion Energy and Virginia Power will continue to manage their spent fuel until it is accepted by the DOE.

than $1 million recorded in depreciation, depletion and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Rental expense for Dominion Energy totaled $113 million, $104 million, and $99 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Rental expense for Virginia Power totaled $57 million, $52 million, and $51 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rental expense for Dominion Energy Gas totaled $34 million, $37 million, and $37 million for
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of rental expense is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.



In July 2016, Dominion Energy signed an agreement with a lessor to construct and lease a new
corporate office property in Richmond, Virginia. The lessor is providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $365 million, to fund the estimated project costs. The project is expected to be completed by

mid-2019.

Dominion Energy has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor, during which time Dominion Energy will request cash draws from the lessor and debt investors to fund all project costs,
which totaled $139 million as of December 31, 2017. If the project is terminated under certain events of default, Dominion Energy could be required to pay up to 89.9% of the then funded amount. For specific full recourse events, Dominion
Energy could be required to pay up to 100% of the then funded amount.

The five-year lease term will commence once construction is
substantially complete and the facility is able to be occupied. At the end of the initial lease term, Dominion Energy can (i) extend the term of the lease for an additional five years, subject to the approval of the participants, at current
market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the project costs or, (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property on behalf of the lessor to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the project costs, Dominion Energy may be required to make a payment to the lessor, up to 87% of
project costs, for the difference between the project costs and sale proceeds.

Guarantees, Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit

In October 2017, Dominion Energy entered into a guarantee agreement to support a portion of Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s obligation under a
$3.4 billion revolving credit facility, also entered in October 2017, with a stated maturity date of October 2021. Dominion Energy’s maximum potential loss exposure under the terms of the guarantee is limited to 48% of the outstanding
borrowings under the revolving credit facility, an equal percentage to Dominion Energy’s ownership in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. As of December 31, 2017, Atlantic Coast Pipeline has borrowed $664 million against the revolving
credit facility. Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a liability of $28 million associated with this guarantee agreement at December 31, 2017.

In addition, at December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy had issued an additional $48 million of guarantees, primarily to support other
equity method investees. No amounts related to the other guarantees have been recorded.

Dominion Energy also enters into guarantee
arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries, primarily to facilitate their commercial transactions with third parties. If any of these subsidiaries fail to perform or pay under the contracts and the counterparties seek performance or
payment, Dominion Energy would be obligated to satisfy such obligation. To the extent that a liability subject to a guarantee has been incurred by one of Dominion Energy’s consolidated subsidiaries, that liability is included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion Energy is not required to recognize liabilities for guarantees issued on behalf of its subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that it will have to perform under the guarantees. Terms of the guarantees

typically end once obligations have been paid. Dominion Energy currently believes it is unlikely that it would be required to perform or otherwise incur any losses associated with guarantees of
its subsidiaries’ obligations.

At December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy had issued the following subsidiary guarantees:

Additionally, at December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy had purchased $153 million of surety bonds, including $63 million at
Virginia Power and $24 million at Dominion Energy Gas, and authorized the issuance of letters of credit by financial institutions of $76 million to facilitate commercial transactions by its subsidiaries with third parties. Under the terms
of surety bonds, the Companies are obligated to indemnify the respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.

As of
December 31, 2017, Virginia Power had issued $14 million of guarantees primarily to support

tax-exempt

debt issued through conduits. The related debt matures in 2031 and is included in long-term debt
in Virginia Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the event of default by a conduit, Virginia Power would be obligated to repay such amounts, which are limited to the principal and interest then outstanding.

the normal course of business, the Companies may sometimes agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may involve an
adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretation of the tax law. The Companies are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

of any other future payments under these contracts because events that would obligate them have not yet occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence.
However, at December 31, 2017, the Companies believe any other future payments, if any, that could ultimately become payable under these contract provisions, would not have a material impact on their results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if counterparties fail to perform their contractual obligations. In order to minimize overall credit risk, credit
policies are maintained, including the evaluation of counterparty financial condition, collateral requirements and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition,
counterparties may make available collateral, including letters of credit or cash held as margin deposits, as a result of exceeding agreed-upon credit limits, or may be required to prepay the transaction.

The Companies maintain a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of their customers, historical trends and
other information. Management believes, based on credit policies and the December 31, 2017 provision for credit losses, that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as
a result of counterparty nonperformance.

As a diversified
energy company, Dominion Energy transacts primarily with major companies in the energy industry and with commercial and residential energy consumers. These transactions principally occur in the Northeast,

mid-Atlantic,

Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the U.S. Dominion Energy does not believe that this geographic concentration contributes significantly to its overall exposure to credit risk. In addition,
as a result of its large and diverse customer base, Dominion Energy is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk for receivables arising from electric and gas utility operations.

Dominion Energy’s exposure to credit risk is concentrated primarily within its energy marketing and price risk management activities, as
Dominion Energy transacts with a smaller, less diverse group of counterparties and transactions may involve large notional volumes and potentially volatile commodity prices. Energy marketing and price risk management activities include marketing of
merchant generation output, structured transactions and the use of financial contracts for enterprise-wide hedging purposes. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized

on-

or

off-balance

sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross credit exposure is calculated prior to the application of any collateral. At
December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy’s credit exposure totaled $95 million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those internally rated, represented 26%, and no single counterparty, whether investment grade or

non-investment

grade, exceeded $13 million of exposure.

Virginia Power sells electricity and provides distribution and transmission services to customers in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Management
believes that this geographic concentration risk is mitigated by the diversity of Virginia Power’s customer base, which includes residential, commercial and industrial customers, as well as rural electric cooperatives and municipalities. Credit
risk associated with trade accounts receivable from energy consumers is limited due to the large number of customers. Virginia Power’s exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from sales to wholesale customers.
Virginia Power’s gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized

In 2017, DETI provided service to 289 customers with approximately 96% of its storage and transportation revenue being provided through firm
services. The ten largest customers provided approximately 38% of the total storage and transportation revenue and the thirty largest provided approximately 68% of the total storage and transportation revenue.

East Ohio distributes natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio using rates established by the Ohio Commission.
Approximately 98% of East Ohio revenues are derived from its regulated gas distribution services. East Ohio’s bad debt risk is mitigated by the regulatory framework established by the Ohio Commission. See Note 13 for further information about
Ohio’s PIPP and UEX Riders that mitigate East Ohio’s overall credit risk.

Credit-Related Contingent Provisions

The majority of Dominion Energy’s derivative instruments contain credit-related contingent provisions. These provisions require Dominion Energy to
provide collateral upon the occurrence of



specific events, primarily a credit downgrade. If the credit-related contingent features underlying these instruments that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash were
fully triggered as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Dominion Energy would have been required to post an additional $62 million and $3 million, respectively, of collateral to its counterparties. The collateral that would be required to
be posted includes the impacts of any offsetting asset positions and any amounts already posted for derivatives,

non-derivative

contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales
exception, per contractual terms. Dominion Energy had posted no collateral at December 31, 2017 and 2016, related to derivatives with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash.
The collateral posted includes any amounts paid related to

non-derivative

contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. The aggregate fair
value of all derivative instruments with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $65 million and $9 million, respectively, which
does not include the impact of any offsetting asset positions. Credit- related contingent provisions for Virginia Power and Dominion Energy Gas were not material as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. See Note 7 for further information about

Management of Dominion Energy understands and accepts responsibility for
Dominion Energy’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (internal control). Dominion Energy continuously strives to identify opportunities to enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency of internal control, just as Dominion Energy does throughout all aspects of its business.

Dominion Energy
maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that its assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance
with established procedures. This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to ensure appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and internal audits.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Dominion Energy, composed entirely of independent directors, meets periodically with the
independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to discuss auditing, internal control, and financial reporting matters of Dominion Energy and to ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. Both
the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit Committee and have free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

SEC rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require Dominion Energy’s 2017 Annual Report to contain a
management’s report and a report of the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of internal control. As a basis for the report, Dominion Energy tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of
internal controls. Based on its assessment as of December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy makes the following assertions:

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting of Dominion Energy.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

Management evaluated Dominion Energy’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that Dominion Energy maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.

Dominion Energy’s independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to express an opinion on Dominion Energy’s internal
control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Opinion on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Dominion Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Dominion
Energy”) at December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, Dominion
Energy maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of Dominion Energy and our report dated February 27, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

Dominion Energy’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Dominion Energy’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to Dominion Energy in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of

the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
