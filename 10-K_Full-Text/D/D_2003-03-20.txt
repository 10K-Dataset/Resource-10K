Dominion Resources, Inc.



Part I

Item 1.    Business

The Company

Dominion Resources, Inc. is a fully integrated gas and electric
holding company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Incorporated in Virginia in 1983, Dominion is a registered public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (the 1935 Act).

The term “Dominion” is used throughout this report
and, depending on the context of its use, may represent any of the following: the legal entity, Dominion Resources, Inc., one of Dominion Resources, Inc.’s consolidated subsidiaries or the entirety of Dominion Resources, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries.

Operating Segments

Dominion manages its operations along three primary business lines that
integrate its electric and gas services, streamline operations and position it for long-term growth in the competitive marketplace.

Dominion Energy

—Dominion Energy manages Dominion’s generation portfolio, consisting primarily of generating units and power purchase agreements. It also manages Dominion’s energy trading and marketing, hedging and arbitrage
activities; and gas pipeline and certain gas production and storage operations. Effective January 1, 2003, Dominion’s electric transmission operations became a part of Dominion Energy.

Dominion
Delivery

—Dominion Delivery manages Dominion’s electric and gas distribution systems, as well as customer service and, through December 31, 2002, electric transmission
functions. Dominion Delivery also includes Dominion’s interest in Dominion Fiber Ventures LLC (DFV), a telecommunications joint venture. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of Dominion’s consolidation of
DFV beginning in February 2003. Effective January 1, 2003, Dominion’s electric transmission operations became a part of the Dominion Energy segment.

Dominion Exploration & Production

—Dominion Exploration & Production manages Dominion’s onshore and offshore gas and oil exploration, development and production operations. They are located in several major producing basins in the lower 48
states, including the outer continental shelf and deep-water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and Western Canada.

While Dominion manages its daily operations as described above, its assets remain wholly-owned by its legal subsidiaries, which are
described below. For additional

financial information on business segments and geographic areas, see Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dominion’s principal direct legal subsidiaries are
Virginia Electric and Power Company (Virginia Power), Consolidated Natural Gas Company (CNG) and Dominion Energy, Inc. (DEI). Virginia Power is a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes power for sale in Virginia and
northeastern North Carolina. CNG is a producer, transporter, distributor and retail marketer of natural gas, serving customers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and other states. DEI is an independent power and natural gas and oil exploration and
production company.

As of December 31, 2002,
Dominion and its subsidiaries had approximately 17,000 full-time employees. Approximately 6,400 employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Dominion’s principal executive offices are located at 120 Tredegar Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219 and its telephone number is
(804) 819-2000.

Dominion’s website address
is www.dom.com. Dominion makes available free of charge through its website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports as soon as practicable after filing or
furnishing the material with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Business Developments

In June 2002, Dominion
acquired Mirant State Line Ventures, Inc. (State Line) from a subsidiary of Mirant Corporation for $185 million in cash. State Line’s assets include a 515 Mw coal-fired generation facility located near Hammond, Indiana. In September 2002,
Dominion acquired Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership (Cove Point) from a subsidiary of The Williams Companies for $225 million in cash. Cove Point’s assets include a liquefied natural gas import facility located near Baltimore, Maryland
that is under reconstruction, a liquefied natural gas storage facility and an approximate 85-mile natural gas pipeline.

Dominion became a registered public utility holding company when it completed the CNG acquisition in January 2000. The 1935 Act prohibits
registered companies from owning businesses not directly related to utility or other energy operations. Dominion has substantially completed its strategy to exit the core operating business of Dominion Capital, Inc.



(DCI), its financial services subsidiary, and continues to seek opportunities to divest of the remaining assets. Currently, Dominion is
required to divest of all remaining DCI holdings by January 2006.

Because it is no longer investing in or creating energy business overseas, Dominion continues to explore the sale of CNG’s remaining international operations in Australia.

In February 2003, pursuant to the terms of its lease
agreement, Dominion purchased the Dresden, Ohio electric generation facility from the lessor. The Dresden facility remains under construction and includes a 550 Mw combined cycle gas-powered generation plant. The purchase price of approximately $266
million was equal to the sum of all amounts previously advanced by the lenders and equity holders with respect to the facility and certain other additional costs and fees due and payable to the lenders and equity holders by Dominion.

Dominion’s acquisitions and divestitures are described in
more detail in Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Seasonality

Sales of electricity in the
Dominion Delivery segment typically vary seasonally based on increased demand for electricity by residential and commercial customers for cooling and heating use based on changes in temperature. The same is true for gas sales based on heating needs.
Dominion Energy’s business is also impacted by seasonal changes in the prices of commodities, primarily electricity and natural gas, that it actively markets and trades. For Dominion Exploration & Production, gas prices can vary seasonally
as well.

Competition

Deregulation and restructuring in the electric and gas industries continue to
create issues that affect or will likely affect the markets where Dominion Energy and Dominion Delivery do business, and govern the way these business units and their competitors operate. The electric power and natural gas industries continue to
evolve into a competitive marketplace where energy companies will compete to provide energy and energy services to a broad range of customers.

Electric Industry

The Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act (Virginia Restructuring Act) was enacted in 1999 and established a plan

to restructure
Virginia’s electric utility industry and provide for the phase-in of choice for retail customers from January 1, 2002 through January 1, 2004. As ordered by the Virginia State Corporation Commission (Virginia Commission), Dominion made retail
choice available for all of its Virginia regulated electric customers as of January 1, 2003.

Under the Virginia Restructuring Act, the generation portion of Dominion’s Virginia jurisdictional operations is no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation effective January 1, 2002. Base
rates (excluding fuel costs and certain other allowable adjustments) are capped and will remain unchanged until July 2007, unless modified or terminated sooner, as provided by the Virginia Restructuring Act. Under the Virginia Restructuring Act,
Dominion may request a termination of the capped rates at any time after January 1, 2004, and the Virginia Commission may grant Dominion’s request to terminate the capped rates, if it finds that a competitive generation services market exists
in Dominion’s service area. Recovery of generation-related costs will continue to be provided through capped rates and a wires charge. A wires charge, where applicable, is being assessed to those customers opting for alternative suppliers. The
Virginia Restructuring Act also requires Dominion to join or establish a regional transmission organization (RTO), phase-in retail choice beginning January 1, 2002, and functionally separate its electric generation from its electric transmission and
distribution operations.

Recently, the Virginia
Commission recommended that state policymakers decide promptly whether to proceed with or delay implementation of the Virginia Restructuring Act, in light of recent developments impacting electric industry restructuring in Virginia, including the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) issuance of a notice of proposed rule making on Standard Market Design. Legislation that would delay entry into a RTO until on or after July 1, 2004 was approved by the Virginia General Assembly in
February 2003 and is now awaiting action by the Governor. The proposed legislation also would require Dominion to file an application with the Virginia Commission by July 1, 2003 to join a RTO. Subject to Virginia Commission approval, Dominion would
be required to transfer management and control of its transmission assets to a RTO by January 1, 2005.

For additional information on electric deregulation in Virginia, see

Regulated Electric Operations

in

Future Issues and
Outlook

in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A).

In North Carolina, regulators and legislators continue to explore the issues related to electric industry restructuring, the



development of a competitive, wholesale market and retail competition. However, to date, there has been no significant activity.

Dominion plans to continue to participate
actively in both the legislative and regulatory processes to ensure an orderly transition from a regulated environment.

Gas Industry

Dominion Delivery

Deregulation is at
varying stages in the three states in which Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries operate. In Pennsylvania, supplier choice is available for all residential and small commercial customers. In Ohio, legislation has not been enacted to require
supplier choice for residential and commercial natural gas consumers. However, Dominion offers an Energy Choice program to customers on its own initiative, in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (Ohio Commission).

West Virginia legislation currently does not require customer
choice in its retail natural gas markets, and Dominion has not voluntarily initiated an Energy Choice program. However, the West Virginia Public Service Commission (West Virginia Commission) recently issued regulations to govern pooling services,
one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customer choice in the future. In 2002, the West Virginia Commission proposed rules that require that competitive gas service providers be licensed in West Virginia. In
addition, the West Virginia Commission is developing rules for a code of conduct between utilities and their marketing affiliates, as well as consumer protection regulations and marketer licensing rules.

See

Regulated Gas Distribution Operations

in

Future
Issues and Outlook

in MD&A for additional information.

Dominion
Energy

Dominion’s large underground natural gas storage
network and the location of its pipeline system are a significant link between the country’s major gas pipelines and large markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and on the East Coast. Dominion’s pipelines are part of an
interconnected gas transmission system which continues to provide local distribution companies, marketers, power generators and industrial and commercial customers the accessibility of supplies nationwide.

Dominion competes with domestic and Canadian pipeline companies and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. Alternative energy sources, such as oil or coal, provide
another level of competition. Although competition is based primarily on price, the array of services that can be provided to customers is also an important factor. The combination of capacity rights held on certain longline pipelines, a large
storage capability and the availability of numerous receipt and delivery points along its own pipeline system enables Dominion to tailor its services to meet the needs of individual customers.

Dominion Exploration & Production

Dominion conducts exploration and production operations in several major
producing basins in the lower 48 states, including the outer continental shelf and deep-water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and Western Canada. Competitors range from major international oil companies, to smaller, independent producers.

Dominion faces significant competition in the bidding for
federal offshore leases and in obtaining leases and drilling rights for onshore properties. Since Dominion is the operator of a number of properties, it also faces competition in securing drilling equipment and supplies for exploration and
development.

In terms of its production
activities, Dominion sells most of its deliverable natural gas and oil into short and intermediate-term markets. Dominion faces challenges related to the marketing of its natural gas and oil production due to the contraction of participants in the
energy marketing industry. In the wake of current industry developments, several energy trading participants have exited the business, reducing the number of active purchasers in the marketplace and reducing Dominion’s delivery flexibility.
However, Dominion owns a large and diverse natural gas and oil portfolio and maintains an active gas and oil marketing presence in its primary production regions which strengthens its knowledge of the marketplace and delivery options.

Regulation

General

Dominion is subject to regulation by the SEC, FERC, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC), the Army Corps of Engineers, and other federal, state and local authorities.



State Regulation

Electric

In Virginia, Dominion’s retail service is subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission. The Virginia Commission has approved a Virginia fuel factor of 1.613 cents per kWh in effect through
December 31, 2003.

In North Carolina, retail
service is subject to cost of service regulation by the North Carolina Utilities Commission (North Carolina Commission). In connection with the North Carolina Commission’s approval of the CNG acquisition, Dominion agreed not to request an
increase in North Carolina retail electric base rates until 2006, except for certain events that would have a significant financial impact on Dominion’s electric utility operations. Fuel rates are still subject to change under the annual fuel
cost adjustment proceedings. The North Carolina Commission has approved a fuel factor of 1.402 cents per kWh, effective January 1, 2003.

Dominion’s electric utility subsidiary holds certificates of public convenience and necessity authorizing it to construct and operate
its electric facilities now in operation and to sell electricity to customers. However, it may not construct or incur financial commitments for construction of any substantial generating facilities or large capacity transmission lines without the
prior approval of various state and federal government agencies.

In August 2002, the Virginia Commission adopted rules relating to competitive electric metering services and consolidated billing by competitive suppliers. Dominion must provide its Virginia electric customers with access to meter
functionality and interval meter data beginning January 1, 2003 and implement consolidated billing by competitive suppliers no later than July 1, 2003.

Gas

Dominion’s gas distribution business subsidiaries are subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of their businesses by the states in which they operate—Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. When necessary,
Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries seek general rate increases on a timely basis to recover increased operating costs and to ensure that rates of return are compatible with the cost of raising capital. In addition to general rate
increases, certain of Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries make routine separate filings with their respective state regulatory commissions to reflect changes

in the costs of
purchased gas. These purchased gas costs are recovered through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets.

Ohio—

In February 2002, Dominion filed a report with the Ohio Commission that addressed the results of a payment matching program approved by the Ohio Commission in
2001 and deferral of certain residential customer receivables in excess of the amount already recovered in rates. The report requires no action by the Ohio Commission. Recovery of the deferred amount will be requested in Dominion’s next rate
case. Dominion believes that it will recover those amounts deferred.

In November 2002, Dominion filed comments to the Ohio Commission’s request for information needed to ensure that Ohio public utilities are not impacted by adverse financial consequences of parent or affiliate company
unregulated operations. Dominion informed the Ohio Commission that its affiliate and parent company transactions are governed by the rules of the 1935 Act. The Ohio Commission has not acted on the comments filed or given any indication as to how it
will proceed at this time.

In December 2002, the
Ohio Commission conditionally approved an earlier application by Dominion to implement a four-month gas cost recovery (GCR) rate. The Ohio Commission approved the adjustment components of the GCR and directed Dominion to leave the expected gas cost
portion of the GCR at the previous level for one more month before filing for a new three-month rate.

In January 2003, the Ohio Commission approved the settlement of Dominion’s 2001 GCR financial and management performance audit. The
settlement contained no disallowances and provided for a review of the corporate gas supply group expense recovery through the GCR and an internal audit of gas procurement processes and affiliate company gas purchase transactions.

Pennsylvania—

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (Pennsylvania Commission) accepted a settlement filed by Dominion and other parties to Dominion’s gas cost
recovery proceeding in September 2002. As part of the settlement, the parties agreed that Dominion was following a least cost procurement policy and, as a result, no disallowances occurred.

West
Virginia—

In 2001, the West Virginia Commission approved a settlement between Dominion and certain third parties, regarding the costs of gas supplies and increased operating costs.
The settlement stipulated that Dominion would receive a $9.5 million increase in gas and non-gas



revenues and provides for a two-year rate moratorium. The new rates took effect on January 1, 2002 and will be in place through December 31,
2003.

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935

Dominion is a registered holding company under the 1935 Act. The 1935 Act and
related regulations issued by the SEC govern activities of Dominion and its subsidiaries with respect to the issuance and acquisition of securities, acquisition and sale of utility assets, certain transactions among affiliates, engaging in business
activities not directly related to the utility or energy business and other matters. Over the past few years, several bills have been introduced in Congress to repeal the 1935 Act, and repeal provisions are currently again pending before Congress.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

Electric

Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale sales of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate
commerce by public utilities. Dominion’s electric utility subsidiary sells electricity in the wholesale market under its market-based sales tariff authorized by FERC but has agreed not to make wholesale power sales under this tariff to loads
located within its service territory. For additional discussion on this matter, see

Regulated Electric Operations—Wholesale Competition

in

Future Issues and Outlook

in MD&A.

The Virginia Restructuring Act requires that Dominion join a
RTO, and FERC encourages RTO formation as a means to foster wholesale market formation. FERC Order No. 2000 requires each public utility that owns or operates transmission facilities to make certain filings with respect to RTO formation, but will
rely on voluntary formation of RTOs to advance its energy policies. By joining a RTO, Dominion would transfer operational control of its transmission assets to a RTO, a third party.

In September 2002, Dominion and PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) entered into the PJM South Implementation
Agreement. The agreement provides that, subject to regulatory approval and certain provisions, Dominion will become a member of PJM, transfer functional control of its electric transmission facilities to PJM for inclusion in a new PJM South Region,
integrate its control

area into the PJM energy markets and otherwise facilitate the establishment and operation of PJM as the RTO with respect to Dominion’s transmission facilities.
The agreement also contemplates additional agreements and transmission tariff provisions to be negotiated by the parties and allocates costs of implementation of the agreement among the parties.

Dominion intends to file for FERC approval to join PJM in the
future. Dominion will also seek authorization from the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission to become a member of PJM at that time. Dominion will incur integration and operating costs associated with joining a RTO. Dominion has
deferred certain of those costs for future recovery and is giving further consideration to seeking regulatory approval to defer the balance of such costs.

Legislation that would delay entry into a RTO until on or after July 1, 2004 was approved by the Virginia General Assembly in February
2003 and is now awaiting action by the Governor. The proposed legislation also would require Dominion to file an application with the Virginia Commission by July 1, 2003 to join a RTO. Subject to Virginia Commission approval, Dominion would be
required to transfer management and control of its transmission assets to a RTO by January 1, 2005.

For additional discussion on this matter, see

RTO

Future Issues and Outlook

in MD&A.

Gas

FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act of 1938
and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended. FERC also has jurisdiction over the construction of pipeline and related facilities used in transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce.

Dominion’s interstate gas transportation and storage
activities are conducted in accordance with certificates, tariffs and service agreements on file with FERC. Dominion is also subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, which authorizes the establishment and enforcement of federal
pipeline safety standards and places jurisdiction of these standards with the Department of Transportation.

Competition in the natural gas industry was increased by FERC Order 636, which was issued in 1992. FERC Order 636 requires transmission
pipelines to operate as open-access transporters and provide transportation and storage services on an equal basis for all gas supplies, whether purchased from Dominion or from another gas supplier.



In the spring of 2003, FERC expects to issue new rules governing standards of conduct
between interstate electric transmission, gas transporation and storage providers and their energy related affiliates. One goal of FERC is to eliminate the separate standards of conduct regulations for natural gas pipelines and electric transmission
utilities and replace these requirements with uniform standards applicable to interstate “Transmission Providers” of both natural gas and electricity. For additional discussion on this matter, see

Interstate Gas Transmission
Operations

Environmental Matters

Each operating segment
faces substantial regulation and compliance costs with respect to environmental matters. For discussion of significant aspects of these matters, including current and planned capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance, see

Environmental Matters

in

Future Issues and Outlook

in MD&A. Additional information can also be found in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

From time to time Dominion may be identified as a potentially
responsible party to a Superfund site. The EPA (or a state) can either (a) allow such a party to conduct and pay for a remedial investigation, feasibility study and remedial action or (b) conduct the remedial investigation and action and then seek
reimbursement from the parties. Each party can be held jointly, severally and strictly liable for all costs. These parties can also bring contribution actions against each other and seek reimbursement from their insurance companies. As a result,
Dominion may be responsible for the costs of remedial investigation and actions under the Superfund Act or other laws or regulations regarding the remediation of waste. Dominion does not believe that any currently identified sites will result in
significant liabilities.

Dominion has determined
that it is associated with 20 former manufactured gas plant sites. Studies conducted by other utilities at their former manufactured gas plants have indicated that their sites contain coal tar and other potentially harmful materials. None of the 20
former sites with which Dominion is associated is under investigation by any state or federal environmental agency, and no investigation or action is currently anticipated. At this time, it is not known to what degree these sites may contain
environmental contamination. Dominion is not able to estimate the cost, if any, that may be required for the possible remediation of these sites.

The EPA amended its oil pollution prevention regulations in July 2002. The total projected cost of compliance with the new regulations is
estimated to range from $21 to $40 million, representing primarily capital expenditures.

The EPA is also considering issuing new regulations that govern existing utilities that employ a cooling
water intake structure, and whose flow levels exceed a minimum threshold. As currently written, EPA’s proposed rule presents several control options under consideration for the final rule. Dominion is evaluating facility information from
certain of its power stations. Given the uncertainties of future action by EPA on this issue, the Dominion cannot predict the future impact on its operations at this time.

Dominion has applied for or obtained the necessary environmental permits material to the operation of its
electric generating stations. Many of these permits are subject to re-issuance and continuing review.

As part of its reissuance of a pollution discharge permit for the Millstone Power Station, the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection will evaluate the ecological impacts of the cooling water intake system. Until the permit is reissued, it is not possible to predict the financial impact, if any, that may result.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

All aspects of the operation and maintenance of Dominion’s nuclear power
stations, which are part of the Dominion Energy segment, are regulated by the NRC. Operating licenses issued by the NRC are subject to revocation, suspension or modification, and operation of a nuclear unit may be suspended if the NRC determines
that the public interest, health or safety so requires.

Dominion filed applications for 20 year life-extension for the North Anna and Surry units in May 2001. The NRC has completed its review of the applications and Dominion expects to receive a renewed license for these units in 2003.
Dominion also expects to file a similar request for the Millstone units in 2004. For more information on this matter, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

From time to time, the NRC adopts new requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities.
In many cases, these new regulations require changes in the design, operation and maintenance of existing nuclear facilities. If the NRC adopts such requirements in the future, it could result in substantial increases in the cost of operating and
maintaining Dominion’s nuclear generating units.

The NRC also requires Dominion to decontaminate nuclear facilities once operations cease. This process is referred to as decommissioning, and Dominion is required by the NRC to prepare for it financially. For information on
compliance with the NRC financial assurance requirements, see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Disposal of spent nuclear fuel is a significant issue associated with the operation and
decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982 required a permanent, federal repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel to be made available by January 31, 1998. In February 2002, the
Secretary of Energy recommended that Yucca Mountain located in the state of Nevada be developed as the permanent repository. Final congressional approval was received in July 2002. The DOE is currently in the process of seeking approval of a NRC
license to begin construction of the repository.

Dominion and other utilities have petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit to review a matter involving DOE and PECO Energy Company (PECO). The petitioners challenged the DOE’s action that allowed PECO to take
credits against payments PECO would have been making into the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF). The credits are part of the DOE’s settlement of PECO’s claim regarding the DOE’s failure to provide a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel
as required by the NWPA. The petition stated that the credits violated the NWPA by depleting the NWF and releasing PECO from a portion of its NWF obligation. The petition also sought an injunction of the DOE’s settlement agreement with PECO and
an injunction against DOE entering into similar agreements. In September 2002, the court issued its decision on the matter declaring the fee adjustment aspect of the settlement between PECO and DOE

“null and void.” The decision does not prevent DOE from settling claims related to its breach of its contractual obligation to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel, but precludes DOE from using the NWF to compensate
utilities for damages incurred by utilities owing to DOE’s breach of its NWF obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel.

Interconnections

Dominion maintains major interconnections with Progress Energy, American Electric Power Company, Inc., PJM-West and PJM. Through this major transmission network, Dominion has arrangements with these
entities for coordinated planning, operation, emergency assistance and exchanges of capacity and energy. See also

Sources of Energy

Sources of Energy—Electricity

Dominion Energy provides electricity for use on a wholesale and a retail level. Dominion Energy can supply electricity demand either from its generation
facilities in Connecticut, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia or through purchased power contracts when needed. The following table lists Dominion’s generating units and capability.



Dominion’s Power Generation

Excludes 50 percent undivided interest owned by Peoples Energy.

(f)

Excludes 50 percent undivided interest owned by Cogen Technologies Morgantown, Ltd. and Hickory Power Corporation.

(g)

Includes generating units which Dominion operates under leasing arrangements.



Power Purchase Contracts

Dominion Energy purchases electricity under contracts with other suppliers to
meet a portion of its system capacity requirements. As of December 31, 2002, Dominion has 42 power purchase contracts with a combined dependable summer capacity of 3,758 Mw. For information on the financial obligations under these agreements, see
Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fuel for Electric
Generation

Dominion uses a variety of fuels to power its
electric generation. These include a mix of both nuclear fuel and fossil fuel as described further below.

Nuclear Fuel Supply

Dominion utilizes both long-term contracts and short-term purchases to support its nuclear fuel requirements. Worldwide market conditions are continuously evaluated to ensure a range of supply options at reasonable prices. Current
agreements, inventories and spot market availability are expected to support current and planned fuel supply needs. Additional fuel is purchased as required to ensure optimum cost and inventory levels.

Fossil Fuel Supply

Dominion utilizes coal, oil and natural gas in its fossil fuel operations. Dominion Energy’s coal supply is obtained
through long-term contracts and spot purchases. Oil and oil-fired generation are used primarily to support heavier system generation loads during very cold or very hot weather periods. System requirements are purchased mainly under short-term spot
agreements.

Dominion uses natural gas as needed
throughout the year for Dominion’s jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional generation facilities. Dominion’s gas supply is obtained from various sources including: purchases from major and independent producers in the Southwest and Midwest
regions; purchases from local producers in the Appalachian area; purchases from gas marketers; and withdrawals from Dominion’s and third party underground storage fields.

Firm natural gas transportation contracts (capacity) exist that allow delivery of gas to our facilities.
Dominion’s capacity portfolio allows flexible natural gas deliveries to its gas turbine fleet, while minimizing costs.

Gas Supply

Dominion is engaged in the sale and storage of natural gas through its operating subsidiaries. Sources of gas supplies for
sale to customers are the same as those described in Fossil Fuel Supply above.

Dominion continues to purchase volumes from the array of accessible producing basins using its firm capacity resources. These purchased supplies include Appalachian resources in Ohio, Pennsylvania and
West Virginia and production from the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and offshore areas. Upon FERC’s restructuring of the interstate pipeline business in 1992 and 1993, pipelines no longer sell the delivered natural gas commodity; rather, customers
provide their own gas supply for wholesale storage and/or delivery by the pipelines. Much of the supply is purchased by local distributors, energy marketing companies or end-users under seasonal or spot purchase agreements.

Gas Storage—Transmission

Dominion’s underground storage facilities play an important part in
balancing gas supply with sales demand and are essential to servicing the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast’s large volume of space-heating business. In addition, storage capacity is an important element in the effective management of both gas supply
and pipeline transport capacity. Dominion operates 26 underground gas storage fields located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New York. Dominion owns 20 of these storage fields and has joint-ownership with other companies in six of the
fields. The total designed capacity of the storage fields is approximately 960 billion cubic feet (bcf). Dominion’s share of the total capacity is about 717 bcf. About one-half of the total capacity is base gas which remains in the reservoirs
at all times to provide the primary pressure which enables the balance of the gas to be withdrawn as needed.

Gas Production

Dominion
Exploration & Production owns 6.1 trillion cubic feet of proved equivalent natural gas reserves and produced almost 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day and 27 thousand barrels of oil per day in 2002.

Dominion Exploration & Production utilizes production
handling and firm transportation contracts to support delivery of its gas and oil in certain market areas. Additional information about these commitments can also be found in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Item 2.    Properties

Dominion leases its principal executive office in Richmond, Virginia as well as corporate offices in other cities in which its subsidiaries operate. It also owns another corporate office in Richmond.

Dominion’s assets consist primarily of its investments in
its subsidiaries, the principal properties of which are described below.

Substantially all of Dominion’s electric subsidiary’s property is subject to the lien of the mortgage securing its First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds and certain of its nonutility generation facilities are subject
to liens.

Dominion Energy utilizes the electric generation facilities listed under the heading

Sources of Energy—Dominion’s Power Generation

in Item 1. Business.

Dominion’s storage operation consists of 26 storage
fields, approximately 373,000 acres of operated leaseholds and 2,000 storage wells. Dominion Energy has approximately 7,900 miles of gas transmission, gathering and storage piplines.

The map below illustrates Dominion’s gas transmission pipelines, storage facilities and electric
transmission lines.

Dominion
Energy also has more than 100 compressor stations with approximately 577,000 installed compressor horsepower located in Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. Some of the stations are used interchangeably for several functions.

Dominion Delivery has approximately 6,000 miles
of electric transmission lines. Portions of Dominion Delivery’s transmission lines cross national parks and forests under permits entitling the federal government to use, at specified charges, surplus capacity in the line, if any exists.

Dominion Delivery’s right-of-way grants
from the apparent owners of real estate have been obtained for most

electric lines, but underlying titles have not been examined except for transmission lines of 69 Kv or more. Where
rights-of-way have not been obtained, they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation, if necessary. Many electric lines are on publicly owned property, where permission to operate can be revoked.

Dominion Delivery’s investment in its gas distribution
network is located in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The gas distribution network includes approximately 27,000 miles of pipe, exclusive of service pipe.



Dominion Exploration & Production owns 6.1 trillion cubic feet of proved equivalent
natural gas reserves and produces approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet of equivalent natural gas per day from its leasehold acreage and facility investments. Dominion, either alone or with partners, holds interests in natural gas and oil lease
acreage, wellbores, well facilities, production platforms and gathering systems. Dominion also owns or holds rights to seismic data and other tools used in exploration and development drilling activities.

Dominion’s share of developed leasehold totals 3.1 million acres, with another 2.4 million acres held for future exploration and development drilling opportunities.

activities of the Dominion Exploration & Production segment and the production activity of Dominion Transmission, Inc., which is included in the Dominion Energy segment:

Company-Owned Proved Gas and Oil
Reserves

Estimated net quantities of proved gas and oil
reserves at December 31 of each of the last three years were as follows:



Certain subsidiaries of Dominion file Form EIA-23 with the DOE, which reports gross proved
reserves, including the working interests share of other owners, for properties operated by such Dominion subsidiaries. The proved reserves reported in the table above represent Dominion’s share of proved reserves for all properties, based on
Dominion’s ownership interest in each property. For properties operated by Dominion, the difference between the proved reserves reported on Form EIA-23 and the Company-owned proved

reserves, reported in the table above, does not exceed five percent. Estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002 are based upon studies for each Dominion property prepared by Dominion’s staff engineers and reviewed by
either Ralph E. Davis Associates, Inc. or Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC guidelines.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, Dominion and its subsidiaries are alleged to be in violation or in default under orders, statutes, rules or regulations relating to the environment, compliance plans or permits
issued by various local, state and federal agencies for the construction or operation of facilities. From time to time, there may be administrative proceedings on these matters pending. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Dominion and
its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on Dominion’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Future Issues and Outlook

in MD&A and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on rate matters and various regulatory proceedings to which Dominion is a party.

Before being acquired by Dominion, Louis Dreyfus and two
predecessor companies were named as defendants in several lawsuits originally filed in 1995 that were subsequently consolidated. The consolidated lawsuit is now pending in the Texas 93rd Judicial District Court in Hildago County, Texas.  The
lawsuit alleges that gas wells and related pipeline facilities operated by Louis Dreyfus, and other facilities operated by other defendants, caused an underground hydrocarbon plume in McAllen, Texas. The plaintiffs claim that they have suffered
damages, including property damage and lost profits, as a result of the plume and seek compensation for these items.

In July 1997, Jack Grynberg, an oil and gas entrepreneur, brought suit against CNG and several of its subsidiaries. The suit seeks damages
for alleged fraudulent mismeasurement of gas volumes and underreporting of gas royalties from gas production taken from federal leases. In 2002, the valuation portion of the claim was dismissed. The plaintiff has filed an appeal.

In April 1998, Harrold E. (Gene) Wright, an oil and gas
entrepreneur, brought suit against CNG Producing Company, a subsidiary of CNG, alleging various fraudulent valuation practices in the payment of royalties on federal leases. Shortly after filing, this case was consolidated under the Federal
Multidistrict Litigation rules with the Grynberg case noted above. A substantial portion of the claim against CNG Producing Company was resolved by settlement in late 2002; however, the suit remains consolidated with the Grynberg case.

In 1999, a class action was filed by Quinque Operating Co. and other parties against approximately 300 defendants, including CNG and several of its subsidiaries, in Stevens County, Kansas. The complaint seeks damages for alleged
fraud, misrepresentation, conversion and assorted other claims, in the measurement and payment of gas royalties from privately held gas leases. The plaintiffs will seek class certification and expedited discovery in Kansas. The defendants have filed
motions to dismiss the case. A motion in opposition to class certification was argued in January 2003.

During 2000, Virginia Power received a Notice of Violation from the EPA, alleging that Virginia Power failed to obtain New Source Review
permits under the Clean Air Act prior to undertaking specified construction projects at the Mt. Storm Power Station in West Virginia. The Attorney General of New York filed a suit against Virginia Power alleging similar violations of the Clean Air
Act at the Mt. Storm Power Station. Virginia Power also received notices from the Attorneys General of Connecticut and New Jersey of their intentions to file suit for similar violations. In December 2002, the Attorney General of Connecticut filed a
motion to intervene as a plaintiff in the action filed by the New York State Attorney General. This action has been stayed. Management believes that Virginia Power has obtained the necessary permits for its generating facilities. Virginia Power has
reached an agreement in principle with the federal government and the state of New York to resolve this situation. The agreement in principle includes payment of a $5 million civil penalty, a commitment of $14 million for environmental projects in
Virginia, West Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, and a 12-year, $1.2 billion capital investment program for environmental improvements at Virginia Power’s coal- fired generating stations in Virginia and West Virginia. Virginia
Power had already committed to a substantial portion of the $1.2 billion expenditures for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions controls. The negotiations over the terms of a binding settlement have expanded beyond the basic agreement in
principle and are ongoing. As of December 31, 2002, Virginia Power has recorded, on a discounted basis, $18 million for the civil penalty and environmental projects.

In June 2002, Wiley Fisher, Jr. and John Fisher filed a purported class action lawsuit against Virginia Power
and Dominion Telecom, Inc. (Dominion Telecom) in the U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia. The plaintiffs claim that Virginia Power and Dominion Telecom strung fiber-optic cable across their land, along a Virginia Power electric transmission
corridor without paying compensation. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for trespass and “unjust enrichment,” as well as punitive damages from the defendants.



The named plaintiffs purport to “represent a class . . . consisting of all owners of land in North Carolina and Virginia, other than
public streets or highways, that underlies Virginia Power’s electric transmission lines and on or in which fiber optic cable has been installed.” The named plaintiffs have asked that the court allow the lawsuit to proceed as a class
action. Discovery has begun and the court has granted a motion to add additional plaintiffs, Harmon T. Tomlinson,

Jr. and Linda D. Tomlinson. The outcome of the proceeding, including an
estimate as to any potential loss, cannot be predicted at this time.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) discusses the results of operations and general financial condition of Dominion. MD&A should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The term “Dominion” is used throughout MD&A and, depending on the context of its use, may represent any of the following: the legal entity, Dominion Resources, Inc., one of Dominion Resources,
Inc.’s consolidated subsidiaries, or the entirety of Dominion Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements That May Affect Future Results

This report contains statements concerning Dominion’s expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are “forward-looking statements”
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In most cases, the reader can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “forecast,”
“expect,” “believe,” “should,” “could,” “plan,” “may” or other similar words.

Dominion makes forward-looking statements with full knowledge that risks and uncertainties exist that may cause actual results to be
materially different from predicted results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are often presented with the forward-looking statements themselves. In addition, other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those
indicated in any forward-looking statement. These factors include weather conditions; fluctuations in energy-related commodities prices and the effect these could have on Dominion’s earnings, liquidity position and the underlying value of its
assets; trading counterparty credit risk; capital market conditions, including price risk due to marketable securities held as investments in trusts and benefit plans; fluctuations in interest rates; changes in rating agency requirements or ratings;
changes in accounting standards; the risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are becoming deregulated; the transfer of control over electric transmission facilities to a regional transmission organization; completing the
divestiture of Dominion Capital, Inc. (DCI) and CNG International Corporation; collective bargaining agreements and labor negotiations; and political and economic conditions (including inflation rates). Some more specific risks are discussed below.

Dominion bases its forward-looking statements
on management’s beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. Dominion



cautions the reader not to place undue reliance on its forward- looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and
projections about future events may, and often do, materially differ from actual results. Dominion undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.

Dominion’s operations are weather sensitive.

Dominion’s results of operations can be affected by changes in the
weather. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms and droughts, can be destructive, causing outages,
production delays and property damage that requires Dominion to incur additional expenses.

Dominion is
subject to complex government regulation that could adversely affect its operations.

Dominion’s operations are subject to extensive regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates
from federal, state and local governmental agencies. Dominion must also comply with environmental legislation and other regulations. Management believes the necessary approvals have been obtained for Dominion’s existing operations and that its
business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. However, new laws or regulations, or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, may require Dominion to incur additional expenses.

Costs of environmental compliance, liabilities and litigation could exceed Dominion’s estimates.

Compliance with
federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs, including remediation and containment and monitoring obligations. In addition, Dominion may be a responsible party for
environmental clean up at a site identified by a regulatory body. Management cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs and
compliance, and the possibility that changes will be made to the current environmental laws and regulations. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially
responsible parties.

Capped electric rates in Virginia may be insufficient to allow full recovery of stranded and
other costs.

Under the Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act, Dominion’s electric base rates (excluding fuel costs and certain other allowable adjustments) remain unchanged until July 2007 unless
modified or terminated consistent with that Act. The capped rates and wires charges that, where applicable, are being assessed to customers opting for alternative suppliers allow

Dominion
to recover certain generation-related costs; however, Dominion remains exposed to numerous risks of cost-recovery shortfalls.

These include exposure to potentially stranded costs, future environmental compliance requirements, changes in tax laws, inflation and increased capital costs. See

Future Issues and Outlook-Regulated Electric Operations

and
Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The electric generation business is subject to
competition

.

Effective January 1, 2002, the generation portion of Dominion’s electric utility operations in Virginia is open to competition and is no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a
result, there is increased pressure to lower costs, including the cost of purchased electricity. Because Dominion’s electric utility generation business has not previously operated in a competitive environment, the extent and timing of entry by
additional competitors into the electric market in Virginia is unknown. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the extent to which Dominion will be able to operate profitably within this new environment. In addition, the success of Dominion’s
merchant power plants depends upon its ability to find buyers willing to enter into power purchase agreements at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Depressed spot and forward wholesale power prices and excess capacity could result in
lower than expected revenues in Dominion’s merchant power business.

There are inherent risks in the
operation of nuclear facilities

.

Dominion operates nuclear facilities that are subject to inherent risks. These include the threat of terrorist attack and ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, the disposal
of which is subject to complex federal and state regulatory constraints. These risks also include the cost of and Dominion’s ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, costs of plant maintenance and exposure to potential
liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities. Dominion maintains decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks. However, it is possible that costs arising from claims could
exceed the amount of any insurance coverage.

The use of derivative instruments could result in financial
losses.

Dominion uses derivative instruments including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to manage its commodity and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion purchases and sells commodity-based
contracts in the natural gas, electricity and oil markets for trading purposes. In the future, Dominion could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a
counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

valuation of these financial instruments involves management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying
assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts. For additional information concerning derivatives and commodity-based trading contracts, see

Market Rate Sensitive
Instruments and Risk Management

and Notes 2 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dominion is exposed
to market risks beyond its control in its energy clearinghouse operations.

Dominion’s energy clearinghouse and risk management operations are subject to multiple market risks including market liquidity,
counterparty credit strength and price volatility. Many industry participants have experienced severe business downturns during the past year resulting in some being forced to exit or curtail their participation in the energy trading markets. This
has led to a reduction in the number of trading partners, lower industry trading revenues and lower than expected revenues in Dominion’s energy clearinghouse operations. Declining credit worthiness of some of Dominion’s trading
counterparties may limit the level of its trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract.

The success of Dominion’s telecommunications business strategy is dependent upon market conditions.

The current strategy of Dominion’s joint
venture in the telecommunications business is based upon its ability to deliver lit capacity, dark fiber and colocation services to its customers. The market for these services, like the telecommunications industry in general, is rapidly changing,
and Dominion cannot be certain that anticipated growth in demand for these services will occur. If the market for these services continues to fail to grow as quickly as anticipated or becomes saturated with competitors, including competitors using
alternative technologies such as wireless, Dominion’s equity and debt investments in the telecommunications business, as well as the results from such investments, may continue to be adversely affected. Additionally, the current market values
of assets in the telecommunications industry have been subject to depressed market conditions. If these conditions continue, Dominion may have to contribute cash to satisfy operating requirements and the underlying value of Dominion’s
telecommunications investments could be affected adversely which, under certain circumstances, could require a write-down of the value of such investments.

Dominion’s exploration and production business is dependent on factors including commodity prices that cannot

be predicted or
controlled.

Dominion’s exploration and production business is subject to numerous risks beyond its control. These factors include fluctuations in natural gas and

crude oil prices, results of future drilling and well completion activities, Dominion’s ability to acquire additional land positions in competitive lease areas, and operational risks that are inherent in the exploration and
production business and could result in disruption of production. In addition, in connection with the use of financial derivatives to hedge future sales of gas and oil production, Dominion’s liquidity may sometimes be affected by margin
requirements. Under these requirements, Dominion must deposit funds with counterparties to cover the fair value of covered contracts in excess of agreed-upon credit limits. Some of these factors could have compounding effects that could also affect
Dominion’s financial results. Also, because Dominion follows the full cost method of accounting for gas and oil exploration and production activities prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), short-term market declines in the
prices of natural gas and oil could adversely affect its financial results. Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. The principal limitation is that these
capitalized amounts may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues based on hedge-adjusted period-end prices from the production of proved gas and oil reserves (the ceiling test). If net capitalized costs exceed the ceiling test,
in a given country, at the end of any quarterly period, then a permanent write-down of the assets must be recognized in that period.

An inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of Dominion’s business plan.

Dominion relies on access to both short-term money markets and
longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from its operations. Management believes that Dominion and its subsidiaries will maintain sufficient access to these financial
markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain disruptions outside of Dominion’s control may increase its cost of borrowing or restrict its ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include an economic
downturn, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or changes to Dominion’s credit ratings. Restrictions on Dominion’s ability to access financial markets may affect its ability to execute its business plan as scheduled.

Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect Dominion’s growth and business
strategy.

As of March 1, 2003, Dominion’s senior unsecured debt is rated BBB+, stable outlook, by Standard & Poor’s Rating Group, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Standard
& Poor’s) and Baa1, negative outlook, by Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s). Both agencies have recently implemented more stringent applications of the financial requirements for various ratings levels. In order to maintain its
current credit



ratings in light of these or future new requirements, Dominion may find it necessary to take steps or change its business plans in ways that
may adversely affect its growth and earnings per share.

A reduction in Dominion’s credit ratings by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s could increase its borrowing costs and adversely affect operating results.

Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect Dominion’s financial
results.

Dominion cannot predict the impact of future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies, the energy industry or its operations specifically. New accounting
standards could be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or the SEC that could change the way Dominion records revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect
Dominion’s reported earnings or increase its liabilities.

Operating
Segments

In general, management’s discussion of Dominion’s results of operations focuses on the contributions of its operating
segments. However, the discussion of Dominion’s financial condition under

Liquidity and Capital Resources

is based on legal entities as Dominion transacts business in the financial markets on that basis. Dominion’s three primary
operating segments are:

Dominion Energy

manages Dominion’s generation portfolio, consisting primarily of
generating units and power purchase agreements. It also manages Dominion’s energy trading and marketing, hedging and arbitrage activities; and gas pipeline and certain gas production and storage operations. Dominion Energy’s operating
results largely reflect: the impact of weather on demand for electricity; customer growth as influenced by overall economic conditions and acquisitions; and changes in prices of commodities, primarily electricity and natural gas, that the segment
actively markets and trades, uses for hedging purposes, and consumes in generation activities. Effective January 1, 2003, Dominion’s electric transmission operations became a part of Dominion Energy.

Dominion Delivery

manages Dominion’s electric and gas distribution systems, as well as customer service and electric
transmission functions. Dominion Delivery’s operating results reflect the impact of weather on demand for electricity and natural gas and customer growth as influenced by overall economic conditions. Dominion Delivery’s electric and gas
businesses are subject to cost-of-service rate regulation; changes in prices of commodities consumed or delivered are generally recoverable in rates charged to customers. However, certain rates may be subject to price caps, limiting recovery of
higher costs in certain circumstances. Dominion Delivery also includes Dominion’s interest in Dominion Fiber Ventures

LLC (DFV), a telecommunications joint venture. See Note 30 for a
discussion of Dominion’s consolidation of DFV beginning in February 2003. Effective January 1, 2003, Dominion’s electric transmission operations became a part of the Dominion Energy operating segment.

Dominion Exploration & Production

manages Dominion’s onshore and offshore gas and oil exploration, development and
production operations. They are located in several major producing basins in the lower 48 states, including the outer continental shelf and deep-water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and Western Canada. Dominion Exploration & Production’s
operating results reflect successful discovery of and production from natural gas and oil reserves, as well as changes in prices of natural gas and oil. Dominion Exploration & Production’s commodity risk is managed by the Dominion Energy
Clearinghouse (the Clearinghouse) by using derivative instruments, such as forwards, swaps, and options.

In addition,
Dominion also presents its corporate functions, financial services and other operations as an operating segment.

For more
information on Dominion’s segments, see Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Dominion has identified the following accounting policies that, as a result of the
judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different
assumptions.

Accounting for risk management and energy trading contracts at fair value

—Dominion uses
derivative instruments to manage its commodity and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion purchases and sells commodity-based contracts in the natural gas, electricity and oil markets for trading purposes. Accounting requirements for
derivatives and hedging activities are complex; interpretation of these requirements by standard-setting bodies is ongoing. All derivatives, other than specific exceptions, are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, beginning in
2001. Energy trading contracts are also reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in fair value, except those related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, are generally included in the determination of
Dominion’s net income at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled. The measurement of fair value is based on actively quoted market prices, if available. In their absence, Dominion seeks indicative price
information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. If pricing information from external sources is



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

not available, measurement involves judgment and estimates. These estimates are based on valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by
Dominion management. For individual contracts, the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the contract’s estimated fair value. In addition, for hedges of forecasted transactions, Dominion must estimate the expected future
cash flows of the forecasted transactions, as well as evaluate the probability of occurrence and timing of such transactions. Changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could affect the timing of recognition of changes in fair
value of certain hedging derivatives. See

Selected Information

Energy Trading Activities

and

Market Rate Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management

in MD&A and Notes 2, 4 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting for gas and oil operations

—Dominion follows the full cost method of accounting
for gas and oil exploration and production activities prescribed by the SEC. Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized and subsequently depreciated using a
unit-of-production method. The depreciable base of costs includes estimated future costs to be incurred in developing proved gas and oil reserves, as well as dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of projected salvage values. The calculations
under this accounting method are dependent on engineering estimates of proved reserve quantities and estimates of the amount and timing of future expenditures to develop the proved reserves. Proved reserves, and the cash flows related to these
reserves, are estimated based on a combination of historical data and estimates of future activity. Actual reserve quantities and development expenditures may differ from the forecasted amounts. In addition, Dominion has significant investments in
unproved properties, which are initially excluded from the depreciable base. Until the properties are evaluated, a ratable portion of the capitalized costs is periodically reclassified to the depreciable base, determined on a property-by-property
basis, over terms of underlying leases. Once a property has been evaluated, any remaining capitalized costs are then transferred to the depreciable base. Capitalized costs in the depreciable base are subject to a ceiling test prescribed by the SEC.
The test limits capitalized amounts to a ceiling—the present value of estimated future net revenues to be derived from the production of proved gas and oil reserves. Dominion performs the test quarterly, on a country-by-country basis, and would
recognize asset impairments to the extent that total capitalized costs exceed the ceiling. Any impairment of excess gas and oil property costs over the ceiling is charged to operations. Given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, it is
possible that Dominion’s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from

proved natural gas and oil reserves could change in the near term. If natural gas or oil prices decline,
even if for only a short period, or if Dominion revises its estimated proved reserves downward, recognition of natural gas and oil property impairments could occur in the future. See Notes 2 and 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of estimates in impairment testing

—

Dominion is required to test at least
annually its goodwill for potential impairment. As part of that test, Dominion is required to determine the fair value of its reporting units. Dominion produces this estimate by using discounted cash flow analyses and other valuation techniques
based on multiples of earnings for peer group companies, as well as analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. These calculations are dependent on many subjective factors, including the selection of appropriate discount
and growth rates, the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions and management’s estimate of future cash flows. The cash flow estimates used by Dominion are based on the best information available at the time the estimates are
made. However, estimates of future cash flows are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results.

Dominion performed the transitional impairment test upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, as of January 1, 2002 and its annual test later in the
year. The fair value of each of Dominion’s reporting units exceeded the related carrying amounts, resulting in no impairment. The underlying assumptions and estimates involved in preparing these fair value calculations could change
significantly from period to period. If Dominion’s estimates of the fair value of its reporting units are substantially reduced, impairment may be indicated and Dominion would be required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment
test. That step measures the amount of impairment, if any, and requires the further use of fair value estimates. A goodwill impairment charge would result in a charge to earnings, with a corresponding reduction of the carrying amount of goodwill on
the balance sheet. Dominion had $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion of goodwill at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See Notes 2 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment tests.

Impairment testing for long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate that such
assets may be impaired. In performing the impairment test, Dominion would estimate the future cash flows associated with individual assets or groups of assets. Impairment results when the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the
related asset’s carrying amount. If



impaired, the asset must be written down to its fair value, which is generally calculated using the present value of its expected future net
cash flows, using an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates used by Dominion are based on the best information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are by nature highly uncertain and may vary
significantly from actual results.

Accounting for retained interests from securitizations—

Securitizations
involve selling loans to qualifying unconsolidated trusts in exchange for cash and retained interests. Retained interests may include unsecured debt of the trust or retained interests in the transferred loans. Dominion holds retained interests from
mortgage and commercial loans securitized in prior years and classifies them as available-for-sale investments, carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Quarterly, Dominion evaluates the key assumptions relating to valuing the
retained interests. Those key assumptions include loan prepayment speeds, credit losses, forward yield curves and discount rates. Using a published forward yield curve, cash flows, net of adjustments for expected credit losses and loan prepayments,
are discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the retained interests. Loan prepayments speeds and credit loss assumptions are based on actual historical results and future estimates. The discount rate is risk adjusted and is periodically
compared to industry averages and recent or similar transactions for reasonableness. Changes in interest rates will result in a change in the forward yield curve and can result in a change in the assumed amount of loan prepayments. Changes in
general economic conditions may impact actual credit losses, thus impacting the credit loss assumption used in Dominion’s quarterly evaluation. Income from the residual interests is reported as other revenue. As discussed in Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2002, 2001 and 2000, Dominion made changes to these key assumptions, resulting in impairment charges for those years. See also Notes 2 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
discussion of securitizations and retained interests and a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.

Accounting for
regulated operations

—Methods of allocating costs to accounting periods for operations subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When the
timing of cost recovery prescribed by regulatory authorities differs from the timing of expense recognition used for accounting purposes, Dominion’s Consolidated Financial Statements may recognize a regulatory asset for expenditures that
otherwise would be expensed. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that will be recovered from customers

through rates. Regulatory liabilities
represent probable future reductions in revenue associated with expected customer credits through rates. Management makes assumptions regarding the probability of regulatory asset recovery through future rates approved by applicable regulatory
authorities. The expectations of future recovery are generally based upon historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of regulatory assets is determined to be less than probable, they would be
expensed in the period such assessment is made. See Notes 2 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results of Operations

Dominion’s discussion of its
results of operations includes a tabular summary of contributions by its operating segments to net income and diluted earnings per share, an overview of 2002 and 2001 results of operations for consolidated Dominion, as well as a more detailed
discussion of operating segment results of operations.

Overview of Consolidated
Operating Results—2002

Dominion earned $4.82 per diluted share on net income of $1.36 billion in 2002, an increase of $818 million
and $2.67 per diluted share over 2001. The increase includes higher net income contributions by all operating segments, partially offset by approximately $0.57 of share dilution, reflecting a substantial increase in the number of average common
shares outstanding during 2002. In addition, Dominion recognized fewer specific charges in 2002, as described in

Corporate and Other

segment results below.

Regulated electric sales and non-regulated retail energy sales increased as a result of favorable weather conditions and growth in customer base. Nonregulated electric sales by Dominion’s merchant
generation fleet declined primarily due to lower electricity prices, partially offset by sales from recently acquired and constructed assets. Sales of gas and oil production increased as a result of higher production levels, reflecting
Dominion’s ongoing drilling programs, the operations of Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp. (Louis Dreyfus), partially offset by natural production declines and by lower average realized prices for gas and oil, including the



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

effects of hedging. Overall, net revenue from Dominion’s energy trading operations decreased for 2002. Gas trading activities
contributed less for 2002, reflecting the effects of net unfavorable price changes on unsettled contracts and lower trading margins, partially offset by higher overall trading volumes. Electric trading activities increased for 2002, reflecting
favorable price changes on unsettled contracts and higher trading margins. Energy trading operations are discussed in more detail as part of the

Dominion Energy

segment results of operations.

In addition to the contributions by its operating segments, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization resulted in a $95 million increase
in net income. During 2002, Dominion did not recognize any significant specific charges, as compared to 2001 when those charges totaled $797 million, as described in the

Corporate and Other

segment results. Interest and related charges
decreased $52 million, reflecting lower overall interest rates on outstanding debt, partially offset by interest on new issues of debt and distributions on trust preferred securities issued in late 2001 and during 2002. Dominion’s effective
income tax rate decreased, reflecting the net $33 million effect of including certain subsidiaries in Dominion’s consolidated state income tax returns. In addition, the effective tax rate decreased for foreign earnings, the discontinuance of
goodwill amortization for book purposes and other factors.

Overview of
Consolidated Operating Results—2001

Dominion earned $2.15 per diluted share on net income of $544 million in 2001, an increase of $108
million and $0.30 per diluted share over 2000. The increase includes higher net income contributions by all operating segments, partially offset by a higher number of specific charges in 2001 as compared to 2000, as discussed in

Corporate and
Other

segment results below.

The increase in results for Dominion’s operating segments for 2001 reflect the
operations of businesses acquired during the year. Dominion acquired Millstone Power Station (Millstone) on March 31, 2001. Its operations contributed significantly to the increase in nonregulated electric sales. Regulated gas sales, nonregulated
gas sales and gas and oil production revenue increased as Consolidated Natural Gas Company’s (CNG) operations were included for all of 2001. In addition, 2001 gas and oil production results reflected the inclusion of Louis Dreyfus for two
months as well as higher realized prices for gas. Dominion’s energy trading operations, recorded as nonregulated gas and electric sales, net of cost of sales, also contributed to the overall operating revenue increase.

The increase in net income contribution by the segments’ operations was partially offset by a higher-level of specific

charges in 2001, as compared to 2000, as described in the discussion of the

Corporate

and Other

segment results. Such charges for 2001 and 2000 totaled $797 million and $579 million,
respectively. Interest expense and related charges decreased $27 million, reflecting lower overall interest rates on outstanding debt. Dominion’s effective income tax rate increased and its other taxes decreased in 2001 because its utility
operations in Virginia became subject to state income taxes in lieu of gross receipts taxes effective January 2001. In addition, Dominion recognized higher effective rates for foreign earnings and higher pretax income in relation to non-conventional
fuel tax credits realized.

Dominion Energy

Operating Results—2002

Dominion Energy contributed $2.72 per diluted share on net income of $770 million for 2002, a net income increase of $47 million and an earnings per share decrease of $0.14 over 2001. Net income for 2002 reflected lower operating
revenue ($204 million), operating expenses ($229 million) and other income ($27 million). Interest expense and income taxes, which are discussed on a consolidated basis, decreased $50 million over 2001. The earnings per share decrease reflected
share dilution.

Regulated electric sales revenue increased $179 million. Favorable weather conditions, reflecting
increased cooling and heating degree-days, as well as customer growth, are estimated to have contributed $133 million and $41 million, respectively. Fuel rate recoveries increased approximately $65 million for 2002. These recoveries are generally
offset by increases in electric fuel expense and do not materially affect income. Partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease of $60 million due to other factors not separately measurable, such as the impact of economic conditions on
customer usage, as well as variations in seasonal rate premiums and discounts.

Nonregulated electric sales revenue increased
$9 million. Sales revenue from Dominion’s merchant generation fleet decreased $21 million, reflecting a $201 million decline due to lower prices partially offset by sales from assets acquired and constructed in 2002 and the inclusion of
Millstone operations for all of 2002. Revenue from the wholesale marketing of utility generation decreased $74 million. Due to the higher



demand of utility service territory customers during 2002, less production from utility plant generation was available for profitable sale in
the wholesale market. Revenue from retail energy sales increased $71 million, reflecting primarily customer growth over the prior year. Net revenue from Dominion’s electric trading activities increased $33 million, reflecting the effect of
favorable price changes on unsettled contracts and higher trading margins.

Nonregulated gas sales revenue decreased
$351 million. The decrease included a $239 million decrease in sales by Dominion’s field services and retail energy marketing operations, reflecting to a large extent declining prices. Revenue associated with gas trading operations, net of
related cost of sales, decreased $112 million. The decrease included $70 million of realized and unrealized losses on the economic hedges of natural gas production by the Dominion Exploration & Production segment. As described below under

Selected Information—Energy Trading Activities,

sales of natural gas by the Dominion Exploration & Production segment at market prices offset these financial losses, resulting in a range of prices contemplated by Dominion’s
overall risk management strategy.

The remaining $42 million decrease was due to unfavorable price changes on unsettled contracts and lower overall trading margins. Those losses were partially offset by contributions from higher trading
volumes in gas and oil markets.

Gas transportation and storage revenue decreased $44 million, primarily reflecting lower
rates.

Electric fuel and energy purchases expense increased $94 million which included an increase of $66 million
associated with Dominion’s energy marketing operations that are not subject to cost-based rate regulation and an increase of $28 million associated with utility operations. Substantially all of the increase associated with non-regulated energy
marketing operations related to higher volumes purchased during the year. For utility operations, energy costs increased $66 million for purchases subject to rate recovery, partially offset by a $38 million decrease in fuel expenses associated with
lower wholesale marketing of utility plant generation.

Purchased gas expense decreased $245 million associated with
Dominion’s field services and retail energy marketing operations. This decrease reflected approximately $162 million associated with declining prices and $83 million associated with lower purchased volumes.

Liquids, pipeline capacity and other purchases decreased $64 million, primarily reflecting comparably lower levels of rate recoveries of
certain costs of transmission operations in the current year period. The difference between actual expenses and amounts recovered in the period are deferred pending future rate adjustments.

Other operations and maintenance expense decreased $14
million, primarily reflecting an $18 million decrease in outage costs due to fewer generation unit outages in the current year.

Depreciation expense decreased $11 million, reflecting decreases in depreciation associated with changes in the estimated useful lives of certain electric generation property, partially offset by increased depreciation associated
with State Line and Millstone operations.

Other income decreased $27 million, including a $14 million decrease in net
realized investment gains in the Millstone decommissioning trusts. In addition, the decrease included a $12 million decline in equity income from Elwood Energy, an equity method investment, reflecting higher interest expense due to the issuance of
additional debt by that company in 2002.

Operating
Results—2001

Dominion Energy contributed $2.86 per diluted share on net income of $723 million for 2001, an increase of $234 million
and $0.79 per diluted share over 2000 results. The increase in net income reflected a full year of CNG operations in 2001, the acquisition of Millstone and reductions in certain operating expenses.

Operating revenue increased $1.3 billion to $6.1 billion in 2001, as compared to 2000 reflecting the acquisition of Millstone and a
full year of CNG operations for 2001. Regulated electric sales for 2001 reflected customer growth and comparatively higher fuel rates; however, these increases were largely offset by comparatively mild weather. Millstone operations largely
contributed to the increase in non-regulated electric sales. Non-regulated gas sales and gas transportation and storage revenue increased, reflecting a full year of CNG operations and increased transportation rates. The results of Dominion’s
trading and marketing operations contributed to the overall increase in operating revenue.

Operating expenses increased $810
million to $4.7 billion for 2001, as compared to 2000. Higher commodity prices contributed to increased electric fuel and energy purchases and purchased gas. In addition, purchased gas increased, reflecting CNG operations for the entirety of
2001. Depreciation increased overall due to the inclusion of Millstone. This increase was partially offset by an extension of the estimated useful lives of Dominion’s nuclear plants in connection with the expected relicensing of those plants.
This change in estimate resulted in a $78 million decrease in depreciation expense. Purchased capacity decreased as Dominion terminated certain contracts in early 2001. Other operations and maintenance increased due to the inclusion of Millstone
operations and scheduled outages at both nuclear and fossil plants.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

Selected Information—Energy Trading Activities

As
previously described, Dominion Energy manages Dominion’s energy trading, hedging and arbitrage activities through the Clearinghouse. Dominion believes these operations complement its integrated energy businesses and facilitate its risk
management activities. As part of these operations, the Clearinghouse enters into contracts for purchases and sales of energy-related commodities, including natural gas, electricity and oil. Settlement of a contract may require physical delivery of
the underlying commodity or, in some cases, an exchange of cash. These contracts are classified as energy trading contracts for financial accounting purposes. The contracts are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as components of current and
non-current derivative and energy trading assets and liabilities. Gains and losses from energy trading contracts, including both realized and unrealized amounts, are reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Income as revenue.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Dominion reports energy trading contracts in its financial statements at fair
value. A discussion of how Dominion determines fair value for its energy trading contracts, can be found in

Critical Accounting Policies

presented earlier in MD&A.

The Clearinghouse enters into contracts with the objective of benefiting from changes in the prices of energy commodities. Clearinghouse
management continually monitors its contract positions, considering location and timing of delivery or settlement for each energy commodity in relation to market price activity, seeking arbitrage opportunities. For example, after entering into a
contract to purchase a commodity, the Clearinghouse typically enters into a sales contract, or a combination of sales contracts, with quantities and delivery or settlement terms that are identical or very similar to those of the purchase contract.
When the purchase and sales contracts are settled either by physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by net cash settlement, the Clearinghouse may receive a net cash margin (a realized gain), or sometimes will pay a net cash margin (a
realized loss).

Until the contracts are settled, however, Dominion must record the changes in the fair value of both
contracts. These changes in fair value represent unrealized gains and losses. To the extent purchase and sales contracts with identical or similar terms are held by the Clearinghouse, the changes in their fair values will generally offset one
another. Although the Clearinghouse may hold purchase or sales contracts for delivery of commodities at particular locations and times that have not been offset, such exposures are monitored and actively managed on a daily basis. Dominion’s
risk

management policies and procedures are designed to limit its exposure to commodity price changes.

Additional discussion can be found in

Market Rate Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management

and Notes 2, 15 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, see Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion of Dominion’s implementation of new accounting requirements effective January 1, 2003 to reflect the decision of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) in Issue No. 02-3,

Issues Involved in Accounting for
Contracts under Issue No. 98-10

. As a result, some energy-related contracts are no longer subject to fair value accounting.

During 2002, the Clearinghouse also held derivative financial contracts to manage the price risk of certain anticipated sales of Dominion Exploration & Production’s 2002 and 2003 natural gas production (economic hedges).
Dominion did not designate these derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, any change in the fair value of these derivatives is included in earnings. During 2002, Dominion Energy recognized a loss of $48 million related to the
2002 economic hedges, representing $43 million from contract settlements and $5 million for the reversal of unrealized gains that existed at December 31, 2001. In addition, Dominion Energy recognized $22 million of unrealized losses in 2002 related
to the change in the fair value of the 2003 economic hedges. As anticipated, Dominion Exploration & Production sold sufficient volumes of natural gas in 2002 at market prices, which, when combined with the settlement of the 2002 economic hedges,
resulted in a range of prices for those sales contemplated by the risk management strategy. Similarly, Dominion expects the combination of anticipated gas sales and the 2003 economic hedges to result in a range of prices for those sales as
contemplated by this risk management strategy in 2003.

A summary of the changes in the unrealized gains and losses in
Dominion’s energy trading contracts, including the economic hedges described above, during 2002 follows:

The
balance of net unrealized gains and losses in Dominion’s energy trading contracts, including the economic hedges discussed above, at December 31, 2002 is summarized



in the following table based on the approach used to determine fair value and the contract settlement or delivery dates:

(1)

Exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts.

(2)

Values based on prices from over-the-counter broker activity and industry services and, where applicable, conventional option pricing models.

(3)

Values based on Dominion’s estimate of future commodity prices when information from external sources is not available and use of internally-developed models, reflecting
option pricing theory, discounted cash flow concepts, etc.

Dominion Delivery

Operating Results—2002

Dominion Delivery contributed $1.61 per diluted share on net income of $455 million for 2002, an increase of $89 million and $0.16 per
diluted share over 2001. Net income for 2002 reflected lower operating revenue ($411 million), operating expenses ($549 million) and other income ($37 million). Changes in interest and income taxes, which are discussed on a consolidated basis, were
not significant.

Regulated electric sales revenue increased $58 million. Favorable weather conditions, reflecting
increased cooling and heating degree-days, as well as customer growth, are estimated to have contributed $62 million and $19 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease of $23 million due to other factors not
separately measurable, such as the impact of economic conditions on customer usage, as well as variations in seasonal rate premiums and discounts.

Regulated gas sales revenue decreased $533 million, reflecting $550 million for lower gas cost recoveries attributable to lower
prices and customer migration, partially offset by the impact of slightly colder weather and other factors. The decrease was substantially offset by a $489 million decrease in purchased gas expense, reflecting the matching of purchased gas costs and
gas cost recoveries in rates, and increased gas transportation service revenue.

Gas transportation and storage revenue
increased $36 million, primarily reflecting the shift of customer status from regulated gas sales to gas transportation service in connection with the switch by distribution customers to other natural gas suppliers. The migration of customers does
not generally affect net income, as the recognition of the cost of gas delivered for regulated gas sales customers is matched against rate recoveries.

Other operations and maintenance expense decreased $50 million, primarily reflecting lower general and administrative expenses.

Depreciation decreased $11 million as a result of changes in the estimated useful lives of electric distribution assets.

Other income decreased $37 million, reflecting to a large extent a $27 million increase in equity losses on Dominion’s
telecommunications joint venture. The increased losses reflected lower revenue and increased operating expenses resulting from the expansion into several new markets in 2002. See Notes 30 and 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating Results—2001

Dominion Delivery contributed $1.45 per diluted share on net income of $366 million for 2001, an increase of $27 million and $0.02 per diluted share over
2000 results. The increase in net income reflects slightly higher gas throughput and slightly lower volumes of electricity delivered, as well as overall higher gas and electric rates.

Operating revenue increased $137 million to $3.0 billion for 2001, reflecting a full year of CNG operations for 2001. This is
reflected in higher regulated gas sales and gas transportation and storage revenue as a result of higher overall throughput and rates. Regulated electric sales for 2001 reflect customer growth and comparatively higher fuel rates, partially offset by
the effect of comparatively milder weather.

Operating expenses increased $79 million to $2.2 billion for 2001. Higher
prices for commodities delivered or consumed contributed to increased purchased gas expense. In addition, purchased gas increased, as 2000 amounts only included 11 months of CNG operations.

Dominion Exploration & Production

(1)

Average realized prices with hedging results do not include the financial losses incurred on the economic hedges which are reported in and discussed as part of the operating
results of the Dominion Energy segment.

Operating
Results—2002

Dominion Exploration & Production contributed $1.34 per diluted share on net income of $380 million, an increase of
$60 million and $0.07 per diluted share over 2001.

Operating revenue increased $259 million to $1.7 billion for 2002,
reflecting higher overall production as a result of the full year operations of Louis Dreyfus and Dominion’s ongoing drilling programs, partially offset by natural production declines. Average realized gas and oil prices, including the effects
of hedging, decreased for the comparative years.

Operating expenses increased $177 million to $1.1 billion for 2002,
and reflect primarily the impact of including Louis Dreyfus operations in 2002. The increase includes an increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $138 million in connection with the higher levels of production noted above,
partially offset by lower depletion rates due primarily to the inclusion of properties from the Louis Dreyfus acquisition.

Operating Results—2001

Dominion Exploration &
Production contributed $1.27 per diluted share on net income of $320 million, an increase of $65 million and $0.19 per diluted share, as compared to 2000 results. Operating revenue increased $130 million to $1.5 billion for 2001, reflecting a
full year of CNG operations for 2001, two months of Louis Dreyfus operations and higher average realized gas and oil prices. The production increases reflect the addition of Louis Dreyfus operations in the fourth quarter of 2001, offset somewhat by
natural declines at certain Dominion gas and oil production properties.

Operating expenses increased $14 million to
$934 million for 2001, as compared to 2000, and include the acquisition of Louis Dreyfus in the fourth quarter of 2001, as well as higher operations and maintenance expenses associated with service industry and contractor costs. Purchases of
gas and oil for brokered sales decreased in 2001.

Corporate and Other

Operating Results—2002

The net loss associated with corporate and other operations for 2002 was $243 million and $(0.85) per diluted share, a decrease of $622
million and $2.58 per diluted share over 2001. The decrease in net loss reflected higher operating expenses for 2001 as a result of specific charges described in

Operating Results—2001

below. In addition, the decreased net loss for 2002
included an $88 million decrease in operating expenses, due to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization.

Operating Results—2001

The net loss associated with corporate and other operations for 2001 was
$865 million and $(3.43) per diluted share, an increase of $218 million and $0.70 per diluted share over 2000. These results reflect comparatively higher operating expenses for 2001 that included the following specific items, which are discussed in
Notes 6, 8, 9, 15 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements:

n

a $105 million charge for restructuring
activities, including employee severance and termination benefits and costs associated with the termination of leases;

n

a $281 million
charge, reported in other operations and maintenance expense, for the impairment of various DCI investments;

n

a $151 million
charge for credit exposure associated with the bankruptcy of Enron;

n

a $220 million charge, reported in operations
and maintenance expense, related to the termination of certain long-term power purchase contracts; and

n

a $40 million
loss on the sale of Saxon Capital, reported in other operations and maintenance expense.

Charges in 2000 included
restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $460 million and DCI impairments of $119 million. These charges were partially offset by the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $21 million. These items are discussed in Notes 3, 8 and 9 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Dominion and its subsidiaries depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital
requirements. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operating activities are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through sales of securities and additional long-term debt
financing.



Internal Sources of Liquidity

As presented on Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, net cash flows from operating activities were $2.4 billion, $2.4
billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Dominion’s management believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow sufficient to contribute to planned levels of capital
expenditures and maintain current shareholder dividend levels. As noted above, Dominion uses a combination of debt and equity securities to fund capital requirements not covered by the timing or amounts of operating cash flows. As discussed under

Credit Ratings

and

Cash Requirements for Planned Capital Expenditures

below, Dominion is taking steps to improve its financial position in response to current credit rating requirements. As a result of these measures, Dominion
may choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures, to the extent they are not fully covered by operating cash flows. Dominion would do this in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings, beyond those needed to cover
normal maturities and redemptions.

Dominion’s operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively
impact cash flows from operations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:

n

unusual weather
and its effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices;

n

extreme weather events that could disrupt
offshore gas and oil production or cause catastrophic damage to Dominion’s electric distribution and transmission systems;

n

exposure to unanticipated changes in prices for energy commodities purchased or sold, including the effect on derivative instruments that may require the use of funds to post margin deposits with counterparties;

n

effectiveness of Dominion’s risk management activities and underlying assessment of market conditions and related factors,
including energy commodity prices, basis, liquidity, volatility, counterparty credit risk, availability of generation and transmission capacity, currency exchange rates and interest rates;

n

the cost of replacement electric energy in the event of longer-than-expected or unscheduled generation outages;

n

contractual or regulatory restrictions on transfers of funds among Dominion and its subsidiaries; and

n

timeliness of recovery for costs subject to cost-of-service utility rate regulation.

External
Sources of Liquidity

Dominion Resources, Inc., Virginia Electric and Power Company (Virginia Power) and CNG (collectively the Dominion
Companies) rely on bank and capital markets as a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by the companies’ operations. As discussed further in the

Credit Ratings

section below, the Dominion
Companies’ ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by the issuing company’s credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory approvals,
including the SEC and, in the case of Virginia Power, the Virginia State Corporation Commission (Virginia Commission).

During 2002, the Dominion Companies issued long-term debt (net of exchanged debt), trust preferred securities, preferred stock and common stock totaling approximately $4.85 billion. The proceeds were used primarily to repay other
debt and to finance capital expenditures.

Credit Facilities and
Short-Term Debt

The Dominion Companies use short-term debt, primarily commercial paper, to fund working capital requirements and as bridge
financing for acquisitions. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. The commercial paper programs are supported by
the credit facilities discussed below.

At December 31, 2002, the Dominion Companies had the following short-term debt
outstanding and capacity available under credit facilities:

(1)

The joint credit facilities support borrowings by the Dominion Companies. The 364-day revolving credit facility terminates in May 2003 and the three-year revolving credit
facility terminates in May 2005. Dominion expects to renew the 364-day revolving credit facility prior to its maturity.

(2)

This credit facility is used to support the issuance of letters of credit and commercial paper by CNG to fund collateral requirements under its gas and oil hedging program.
The credit facility terminates in August 2003.

(3)

Dominion financed its acquisition of Cove Point with commercial paper supported by this facility. The facility terminated on March 5, 2003 and was not renewed.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

Long-Term Debt

During 2002, Dominion Resources, Inc.
and its subsidiaries issued the following long-term debt:

(1)

Securities are denominated in Canadian dollars but presented here in US dollars, based on exchange rates as of date of issuance.

(2)

During 2002, Virginia Power redeemed $117 million of 6.75 percent mortgage bonds due 2007 in a direct exchange for 5.375 percent senior notes due 2007. Also during 2002,
Dominion redeemed $200 million of 7.40 percent remarketable senior notes and $250 million variable rate remarketable senior notes, both due 2012, in a direct exchange for $520 million 5.70 percent senior notes due 2012. That principal amount
was determined by an exchange ratio based on the fair value of the remarketable senior notes. The direct exchanges are discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2002, Dominion issued $300 million of 5.125
percent senior notes due 2009 and $300 million of 6.75 percent senior notes due 2032. Dominion placed $500 million of proceeds in escrow to be used solely to repay a portion of certain Dominion senior notes maturing in January 2003. The remaining
principal amount of the maturing senior notes was repaid through the issuance of additional commercial paper in January 2003.

In February 2003, Dominion Resources issued $300 million of 2.80 percent senior notes due 2005 and $400 million of 4.125 percent senior notes due 2008. Also in February 2003, Dominion Resources issued $500 million of variable rate
senior notes due 2013, in a private placement of the securities. In February 2003, Virginia Power issued $400 million of 4.75 percent senior notes due 2013. In March 2003, Dominion issued $300 million of 5.0 percent senior notes due 2013 and $300
million of 6.30 percent senior notes due 2033. The proceeds from these debt issuances were used primarily for Dominion’s tender offering for Dominion Fiber Ventures, LLC senior notes, debt maturities, commercial paper and other general
corporate purposes. The acquisition of Dominion Fiber Ventures, LLC senior notes is discussed in

MD&A under

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

and Note 30 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

During 2002, Dominion and its subsidiaries repaid $1.6 billion of long-term debt securities.

Trust Preferred Securities

During 2002, Virginia Power, through a capital trust subsidiary, issued $400 million of 7.375 percent trust preferred securities. The trust preferred
securities must be redeemed when the trust’s sole assets, the junior subordinated notes due 2042 issued by Virginia Power, are repaid. Virginia Power used the net proceeds from the sale of trust preferred securities primarily to redeem its
variable rate preferred stock as discussed under

Preferred Stock

below for $250 million and $135 million of 8.05 percent trust preferred securities of Virginia Power Capital Trust I. Trust preferred securities are discussed in Note 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Preferred Stock

During 2002, Virginia Power issued 1,250 units consisting of 1,000 shares per unit of cumulative preferred stock for $125 million. Proceeds were used for
general corporate purposes. The preferred stock has a dividend rate of 5.50 percent until the end of the initial dividend period on December 20, 2007. The dividend rate for subsequent periods will be determined according to periodic auctions. The
preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $100 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. During 2002, Virginia Power used the proceeds from the sale of trust preferred securities to redeem its variable rate preferred stock October 1988
Series, June 1989 Series, September 1992A Series, and September 1992B Series for $250 million. Preferred stock is discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Common Stock

During 2002, Dominion issued 44 million shares of common stock and received proceeds of $2.0 billion. Approximately 38 million shares and proceeds of $1.7 billion resulted from two public
offerings. Net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, principally repayment of debt. The remainder of the shares issued and proceeds received during 2002 occurred through Dominion Direct

®

(a dividend reinvestment and open enrollment direct stock purchase plan), employee savings plans and the exercise of employee stock options. During
2002, Dominion also reacquired approximately one million shares of its common stock for $66 million primarily with proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options.

Amounts Available under Shelf Registrations

At March 6, 2003, Dominion Resources, Inc., Virginia Power, and CNG had approximately $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively, of available capacity under currently



effective shelf registrations. Securities that may be issued under these shelf registrations, depending upon the registrant, include senior
notes (including medium-term notes), subordinated notes, first and refunding mortgage bonds, trust preferred securities, preferred stock and common stock.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide
banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Management believes that the current credit ratings of the Dominion Companies provide
sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the bank and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion may affect the Dominion Companies’ ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return
required by investors.

Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics)
factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company’s credit rating. Credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be
evaluated independently. The credit ratings for the Dominion Companies are most affected by each company’s financial profile, mix of regulated and non-regulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating
agencies and “event risk,” if applicable, such as major acquisitions.

Credit ratings for the Dominion Companies as
of March 1, 2003 follow:

These credit ratings reflect Standard & Poor’s
downgrade of its credit ratings for Virginia Power’s debt, preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, preferred stock and commercial paper in October 2002. Based on its conclusions about regulatory insulation in Virginia being no better than
other states, Standard & Poor’s concluded that Virginia Power’s

ratings should be no more than one-notch above the ratings of its parent, Dominion Resources, Inc. Standard
& Poor’s noted that Virginia Power’s downgrade is not reflective of any diminished credit protection measures, as Virginia Power’s credit protection measures on a stand-alone basis remain strong. As of March 1, 2003, Moody’s
maintains a negative outlook for its ratings of Dominion Resources, Inc. and CNG.

Generally, a downgrade in an individual
company’s credit rating would not restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing so long as its credit rating remains “investment grade,” but it would increase the cost of borrowing. Dominion has been working closely
with both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s with the objective of maintaining its current credit ratings. Recent steps to improve the agencies’ view of Dominion’s financial position include the reduction of planned capital
spending and related borrowings, as discussed below, and the issuance of $2.0 billion of common stock during 2002. As discussed in

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements That May Affect Future Results,

in order to maintain its current
ratings, Dominion may find it necessary to take further steps or change its business plans, and such changes may adversely affect its growth and earnings per share.

Debt Covenants

As part of
borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, the Dominion Companies must enter enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of
principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a
waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to the Dominion Companies. Some of the
typical covenants include:

n

the timely payment of principal and interest;

n

information requirements, including submittal of financial reports filed with the SEC to lenders;

n

keeping books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

n

payment of taxes, maintaining insurance;

n

performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation, restrictions on disposition of
substantial assets;

n

financial covenants, such as a limit on total funded debt to total capitalization;



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

n

compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and

n

limitations on liens.

Dominion monitors the covenants on a regular basis in order to provide assurance that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2002, there were no events of default under the Dominion Companies’ covenants.

Investing Activities

During 2002, investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $4.0 billion, reflecting the following:

n

$1.3 billion that included construction and expansion of generation facilities, including environmental upgrades, purchase of
nuclear fuel, and construction and improvements of gas and electric transmission and distribution assets;

n

$1.5 billion
for the purchase and development of gas and oil producing properties, drilling and equipment costs and undeveloped lease acquisitions;

n

the acquisitions of State Line for $185 million and Cove Point for $225 million; and

n

contributions
to escrow of $500 million that were subsequently used to repay a portion of certain Dominion senior notes maturing in January 2003.

Cash Requirements for Planned Capital Expenditures

Cash
requirements for Dominion’s planned capital expenditures during 2003, 2004 and 2005 are expected to total approximately $2.5 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. These expenditures include construction and expansion of
generation facilities, environmental upgrades, construction improvements and expansion of gas and electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel and expenditures to develop natural gas and oil properties. Dominion expects
to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations, and a combination of sales of securities and short-term borrowings.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Leasing Arrangements

As of December 31, 2002, Dominion,
through certain subsidiaries, has entered into agreements with special purpose entities (lessors) in order to finance and lease several new power generation projects, as well as its corporate headquarters and aircraft. As Dominion is considered the
owner of the leased property for tax purposes, it is entitled to tax deductions for depreciation not recognized for financial accounting purposes. In addition, because the leases are structured to be operating leases for financial accounting
purposes, the assets and related borrowings used to finance the construction of the assets are not included on Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although this improves measures of leverage calculated using amounts reported in
Dominion’s Consolidated Financial

Statements, credit rating agencies view such amounts as debt obligations in evaluating Dominion’s credit profile. These leasing structures
provide a desirable level of operational flexibility. Dominion has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor and controls the design and construction of the facility. Also, Dominion has the option to purchase the facility at the
expiration or termination of the lease and thus may benefit from any appreciation in the value of the facility. While Dominion is exposed to sharing in any loss that could occur if the project were terminated prior to completion or sold after being
completed, such exposure is limited to a stated percentage of the realized loss, as discussed below. In addition, under the terms of each lease, the lessee generally retains operational control of the facility.

At December 31, 2002, the lessors had an aggregate financing commitment from equity and debt investors of $2.2 billion. Of that
amount, $1.6 billion had been used for total project costs. Total project costs at December 31, 2002 included approximately $288 million of costs advanced by Dominion to the lessor, that will be reimbursed by the lessor during the second quarter of
2003. Dominion, in its role as construction agent for the lessors, is responsible for completing construction by a specified date. In the event a project is terminated before completion, Dominion has the option either to purchase the project for 100
percent of project costs or terminate the project and make a payment to the lessor of approximately, but no more, than 89.9 percent of project costs. Upon completion of each individual project, Dominion has use of the project assets subject to an
operating lease. Dominion’s lease payments to the lessors are sufficient to provide a return to the investors. At the end of each individual project’s lease term, Dominion may renew the lease at negotiated amounts based on project costs
and current market conditions, subject to investors’ approval; purchase the project at its original construction cost; or sell the project, on behalf of the lessors, to an independent third party. If the project is sold and the proceeds from
the sale are insufficient to repay the investors, Dominion may be required to make a payment to the lessors up to an amount ranging from 81 percent to 85 percent of the project cost, depending on the individual project and applicable agreement.
Dominion has guaranteed a portion of the obligations of its subsidiaries to the lessors during the construction and post-construction periods. Neither the guarantees nor the underlying transaction documents contain any type of credit rating or stock
price trigger events.

In February 2003, pursuant to the terms of its lease agreement, Dominion purchased the electric
generation facility under construction in Dresden, Ohio for $266 million. This amount was included in total project costs of $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2002. Dominion expects to complete construction in 2005 at an estimated cost of $350
million.



Annual minimum
lease payments under these leases for assets currently in use total approximately $38 million. Projects being developed under leasing arrangements are scheduled for completion in 2003 and 2004. Annual lease payments for these projects are estimated
to be $7 million for 2003 and $79 million by 2005. The leases are discussed in Notes 4 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Securitizations of Mortgages and Loans

As of December
31, 2002, Dominion held $448 million of retained interests from securitizations of mortgage and commercial loans completed in prior years. Dominion did not securitize or originate loans in 2002. Investors in the securitization trusts have no
recourse to Dominion’s other assets for failure of debtors to repay principal and interest on the underlying loans when due. Therefore, Dominion’s exposure to any future losses from this activity is limited to its investment in retained
interests. Securitizations are discussed in

Accounting for retained interests from

securitizations

under

Critical Accounting Policies

and Notes 2, 9 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dominion Fiber Ventures, LLC

As discussed in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Dominion has accounted for its 50 percent voting interest in Dominion Fiber Ventures,
LLC (DFV), a telecommunications joint venture, under the equity method. In connection with its formation, DFV issued $665 million of senior notes due March 2005. As DFV was not consolidated by Dominion, these notes were not reported on
Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2002. The DFV senior notes were secured in part by Dominion convertible preferred stock held in trust. Dominion was the beneficial owner of the trust and included it in the preparation of
its Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to Dominion’s repurchase of substantially all of the outstanding DFV senior notes in February 2003, as described below, the preferred stock would have been subject to being remarketed in an amount
sufficient to retire the notes at maturity or earlier if the credit ratings for Dominion Resources, Inc. senior unsecured debt were BBB– or Baa3 during a period when the closing price of Dominion’s common stock was below $45.97 for ten
consecutive trading days. If the remarketing of the preferred stock occurred, the convertible preferred stock would have been considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of Dominion’s common stock or could have resulted in the
issuance of additional shares of Dominion common stock, if converted. Related-party transactions between Dominion and DFV included borrowings, payment of interest and the provision of support services by Dominion to DFV. These transactions are
discussed in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 23, 2003, Dominion and DFV made a tender and consent offering for the DFV senior notes. Under the terms of the offering, DFV sought the consent of the note holders to remove the stock price and credit downgrade trigger
described above as well as certain other related modifications to the indenture. Dominion offered to purchase for cash all of the outstanding notes. The consent and tender offer was successful, resulting in the removal of the stock price and credit
downgrade trigger and the purchase of $633 million of the outstanding notes by Dominion on February 21, 2003. Dominion paid a total of $664 million for the notes acquired, using proceeds from the sale of $700 million of senior notes in February
2003. As a result of this transaction, Dominion will consolidate the results of DFV in its financial statements beginning in February 2003. The DFV senior notes held by Dominion will be eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, since Dominion holds
substantially all of the DFV Senior Notes, it is unlikely that the remarketing of the Dominion convertible preferred stock held in trust, discussed above, would ever occur. After the transaction, $21 million of the DFV senior notes remain
outstanding in the hands of the third parties. Dominion will recognize a pre-tax charge of approximately $60 million on the effective extinguishment of the acquired notes in the first quarter of 2003. The charge will consist primarily of the premium
paid to acquire the notes, the consent fee paid to the note holders and the write-off of unamortized debt costs related to the original issuance of the DFV senior notes. The charge will be reported in the Corporate and Other segment. See

Outlook
for 2003

Contractual Obligations

Presented below is a summary of Dominion’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. These items are discussed in Notes 21, 22 and 27 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1)

Amounts relate to in-service assets as of December 31, 2002. Estimated lease payments for leased assets under construction, as described in Note 27 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, are estimated to be $7 million in 2003 increasing to $79 million by 2005, as projects are completed.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

Dominion expects to fund these obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations and a combination of sales of securities and
short-term borrowings. These amounts do not include planned capital expenditures or working capital commitments, such as the repayment of short-term debt and settlement of derivative and energy trading contracts, or amounts for interest or
distributions payable on securities issued by Dominion.

As described in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Dominion Resources, Inc. and certain subsidiaries have entered agreements that provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of unconsolidated entities and officers. At December 31, 2002, these guarantees totaled $102
million. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Future
Issues and Outlook

Regulated Electric Operations

Electric Deregulation Legislation

Virginia

—Enacted In 1999, the Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act (the Virginia Restructuring Act) establishes a plan to
restructure Virginia’s electric utility industry. The Act provides for the phase-in of choice for retail customers from January 1, 2002 through January 1, 2004. As ordered by the Virginia Commission, Dominion made retail choice available to all
of its Virginia regulated electric customers as of January 1, 2003.

Under the Virginia Restructuring Act, the generation
portion of Dominion’s Virginia jurisdictional operations was no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation as of January 1, 2002. Dominion’s base rates (excluding fuel costs and certain other allowable adjustments) will remain capped
until July 2007, unless modified or terminated sooner under the Act. Recovery of generation-related costs will continue through capped rates, and, where applicable, a wires charge assessed on those customers opting for alternative suppliers.
Dominion may petition the Virginia Commission to terminate the capped rates after January 1, 2004. If Dominion were to request that the capped rates be terminated, the Virginia Commission may terminate the capped rates if it finds that a competitive
generation services market exists within Dominion’s service area.

Additionally, the Virginia Restructuring Act provides
that after the end of the capped rate period, any default service provided by Dominion will be based upon competitive market prices for electric generation services. The Virginia Commission has opened a proceeding to determine the components of
default service in Virginia.

North Carolina

—The North Carolina General Assembly has been exploring the
future of electric service in North

Carolina, the development of a competitive wholesale market and retail competition. However, to date, there has been no significant activity.

Virginia Commission Report on the Status of Competition
in Virginia

In August 2002, the Virginia Commission submitted to the Governor and the Legislative Transition Task Force (Task

Force) its status report on the development of a competitive retail market for electric generation within Virginia.

In an addendum to the report, the Virginia Commission recommended that state policymakers should decide promptly whether to proceed with
or delay implementation of the Virginia Restructuring Act, in light of recent developments impacting electric industry restructuring in Virginia, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) issuance of a notice of proposed rule
making on Standard Market Design. No assessment can be made at this time concerning future developments.

Legislation that
would delay entry into a regional transmission organization (RTO) until on or after July 1, 2004 was approved by the Virginia General Assembly in February 2003 and is now awaiting action by the Governor. The proposed legislation also would require
Dominion to file an application with the Virginia Commission by July 1, 2003 to join a RTO. Subject to Virginia Commission approval, Dominion would be required to transfer management and control of its transmission assets to a RTO by January 1,
2005.

Separation of Generation and Delivery Operations in
Virginia

Under the Virginia Restructuring Act, Virginia Power separated its generation, distribution, and transmission functions through
creation of divisions within Virginia Power. Virginia codes of conduct ensure that Virginia Power’s generation and other divisions operate independently and prevent cross-subsidies between the generation and other divisions.

Economic Risks and Benefits During the Transition to a Competitive
Electric Marketplace in Virginia

As previously discussed, Dominion will recover generation-related costs through capped rates and wires
charges, where applicable, assessed to those customers opting for alternative suppliers during the transition period, which extends until July 2007, unless modified or terminated earlier under the Virginia Restructuring Act. Under the Act, Dominion
may request a termination of the capped rates at any time after January 1, 2004, and the Virginia Commission may grant Dominion’s request to terminate the capped rates, if it finds that a competitive generation services market exists in
Dominion’s service area. While Dominion is exposed to certain risks as a result of the deregulation of its utility



operations, it also has the opportunity to realize potential benefits during this transition period, if management is successful in preparing
for the change in the environment in which its generation-related business operates.

Stranded Costs—

Stranded
costs are those costs incurred or commitments made by utilities under cost-based regulation that may not be reasonably expected to be recovered in a competitive market. At December 31, 2002, Dominion’s exposure to potentially stranded costs
consisted of long-term purchased power contracts that could ultimately be determined to be above market; generating plants that could possibly become uneconomical in a deregulated environment; and unfunded obligations for nuclear plant
decommissioning and postretirement benefits not yet recognized in the financial statements. Dominion believes capped electric retail rates and, where applicable, wires charges will provide an opportunity to recover a portion of its potentially
stranded costs, depending on market prices of electricity and other factors. Recovery of Dominion’s potentially stranded costs remains subject to numerous risks even in the capped-rate environment. These include, among others, exposure to
long-term power purchase commitment losses, future environmental compliance requirements, changes in tax laws, nuclear decommissioning costs, inflation, increased capital costs, and recovery of certain other items. These items are discussed in Notes
16, 26 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The enactment of deregulation legislation in 1999 not only caused
the discontinuance of SFAS No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

, for Dominion’s utility generation-related operations but also caused Dominion to review its utility generation assets for impairment and
long-term power purchase contracts for potential loss at that time. Significant assumptions considered in that review included possible future market prices for fuel and electricity, load growth, generating unit availability and future capacity
additions in Dominion’s market, capital expenditures, including those related to environmental improvements, and decommissioning activities. Based on those analyses, no recognition of plant impairments or contract losses was appropriate at that
time. In response to future events resulting from the development of a competitive market structure in Virginia and the expiration or termination of capped rates and wires charges, Dominion may have to reevaluate its utility generation assets for
impairment and long-term power purchase contracts for potential losses. Assumptions about future market prices for electricity represent a critical factor that affects the results of such evaluations. Since 1999, market prices for electricity have
fluctuated significantly and will continue to be subject to volatility. Any such review in the future, which would be highly dependent on assumptions considered appropriate at the time, could possibly result in the recognition of plant

impairment or contract losses that would be material to Dominion’s results of operations or its financial position.

In December 2002, the Task Force requested the Virginia Commission to convene a work group on stranded costs. The work group will attempt to develop a consensus methodology for determining the over- or
under-recovery of stranded costs. The Virginia Commission will report the work group’s findings to the Task Force by July 1, 2003. No assessment can be made at this time concerning future developments.

Changes to Cost Structure

—While the Virginia Restructuring Act did not define specific generation-related costs to be
recovered, it did provide generation-related cash flows (through the combination of capped rates and wires charges billed to customers) during the transition period. The generation-related cash flows provided by the Virginia Restructuring Act are
intended to compensate Dominion for continuing to provide generation services and to allow Dominion management to incur costs to restructure such operations during the transition period. As a result, during the transition period, Dominion may
realize an increased rate of return on its generation-related operations to the extent that management can favorably alter the cost structure underlying its utility generation-related operations. Conversely, the same risks affecting the recovery of
Dominion’s stranded costs, discussed above, may also adversely impact its cost structure during the transition period. Accordingly, Dominion could realize the negative economic impact of any such adverse event. In addition to managing the cost
of its generation-related operations, Dominion may also seek opportunities to sell available electric energy and capacity to customers beyond its electric utility service territory. Using cash flows from operations during the transition period,
Dominion may further alter its cost structure or choose to make additional investment in its business.

The capped rates were
derived from rates established as part of the 1998 Virginia rate settlement and do not provide for specific recovery of particular generation-related expenditures, except for certain regulatory assets. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. To the extent that Dominion manages its operations to reduce its overall operating costs below those levels contemplated by the capped rates, Dominion’s earnings may increase. Since the enactment of the Virginia Restructuring Act,
Dominion has been reviewing its cost structure to identify opportunities to reduce the annual operating expenses of its generation-related operations. For example, in 2001 Dominion terminated certain long-term power purchase agreements resulting in
an after-tax charge of $136 million. By avoiding fixed capacity payments that would have otherwise been required under the contracts, annual after-tax earnings will increase by approximately $30 million during the transition period. See Note 27
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

Also in 2002 and 2001, Dominion revised the estimated useful lives of its electric generation, transmission and distribution assets. The
changes in estimates were based upon expected life-extensions of nuclear plants and new engineering studies of the other assets. As a result of these changes, annual after-tax earnings will increase by approximately $88 million during the transition
period. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

RTO

The Virginia Restructuring Act requires that Dominion join a RTO. FERC encourages RTO formation as a means to foster the
formation of wholesale markets. FERC Order No. 2000 requires each public utility that owns or operates transmission facilities to make certain filings with respect to RTO formation, but will rely on voluntary formation of RTOs to advance its
energy policies. By joining a RTO, Dominion’s regulated electric utility subsidiary, Virginia Power, would transfer functional control of its transmission assets to a RTO, a third party.

In September 2002, Dominion and PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) entered into the PJM South Implementation Agreement. The agreement provides
that, subject to regulatory approval and certain provisions, Dominion will become a member of PJM, transfer functional control of its electric transmission facilities to PJM for inclusion in a new PJM South Region, integrate its control area into
the PJM energy markets and otherwise facilitate the establishment and operation of PJM as the RTO with respect to Dominion’s transmission facilities. The agreement also contemplates additional agreements and transmission tariff provisions to be
negotiated by the parties and allocates costs of implementation of the agreement among the parties.

Dominion intends to file
for FERC approval to join PJM in the future. Dominion will also seek authorization from the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Utilities Commission to become a member of PJM at that time. Dominion will incur integration and operating costs
associated with joining a RTO. Dominion has deferred certain of those costs for future recovery and is giving further consideration to seeking regulatory approval to defer the balance of such costs.

In December 2002, American Electric Power, Commonwealth Edison Company, Dayton Power and Light Company (collectively, the New PJM
Companies), PJM and Dominion tendered a joint filing with FERC. The joint filing proposes to (1) include the New PJM Companies’ transmission facilities within PJM functional control; (2) establish a transmission rate for the existing PJM
region, Dominion and the New PJM Companies; (3) adopt a transitional rate method to maintain transmission revenue for Dominion and the New PJM Companies and (4) amend

certain agreements on
file with FERC concerning the PJM energy market, planning processes and system operations as related to the integration of the New PJM Companies into PJM.

Also in December 2002, Dominion filed with FERC an amendment to its open access transmission tariff to establish a transitional transmission rate method that would apply from the time American Electric
Power and Commonwealth Edison Company would begin to participate under the PJM transmission tariff until Dominion joins PJM.

Legislation that would delay entry into a RTO until on or after July 1, 2004 was approved by the Virginia General Assembly in February 2003 and is now awaiting action by the Governor. The proposed legislation also would require
Dominion to file an application with the Virginia Commission by July 1, 2003 to join a RTO. Subject to Virginia Commission approval, Dominion would be required to transfer management and control of its transmission assets to a RTO by January 1,
2005.

FERC Standard Market Design Proposal

In July 2002, FERC issued proposed rules that would establish a standardized transmission service and wholesale electric market design for entities
participating in wholesale electric markets. FERC proposed to exercise jurisdiction over the transmission component of bundled retail transactions, modify the existing electric transmission tariff to include a single tariff service applicable to all
transmission customers and provide a standard market design for wholesale electric markets. FERC also proposed that transmission owners that have not yet joined a RTO must contract with a separate entity, an independent transmission provider, to
operate their transmission facilities. FERC scheduled a number of technical conferences and meetings with interested parties and has indicated that the market design and timing of the rule is subject to change. No assessment can be made at this time
concerning future developments.

Wholesale Competition

Dominion’s electric utility subsidiary sells electricity in the wholesale market under its market-based sales tariff authorized by FERC
but has agreed not to make wholesale power sales under this tariff to loads located within its service territory. In February 2002, Dominion’s electric utility subsidiary received FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped
rates based on its embedded cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside its service territory. Any such sales would be voluntary. Dominion’s sales of natural gas, liquid hydrocarbon
by-products and oil in wholesale markets are not regulated by FERC.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

Rate Matters—Electric

Virginia—

Dominion filed its Virginia Commission-approved unbundled rates reflecting the functional separation of generation, transmission and distribution in January 2002. Base rates (excluding fuel costs and certain
other allowable adjustments) are capped and will remain unchanged until July 2007, unless modified or terminated sooner as provided by the Virginia Restructuring Act. Under the Act, Dominion may request a termination of the capped rates at any time
after January 1, 2004, and the Virginia Commission may grant Dominion’s request to terminate the capped rates, if it finds that a competitive generation services market exists in Dominion’s service area. Where applicable, wires charges,
effective January 1, 2002 and subject to annual adjustment, will be paid by Dominion’s Virginia jurisdictional retail customers who choose an alternative generation supplier during the capped rate period.

In October 2002, the Virginia Commission approved Dominion’s methodology for its 2003 market prices for generation, including a
capacity adder, and the resulting wires charges. The capacity adder reflects the capacity value that the sale of generation is expected to produce in addition to an energy value in market prices. Inclusion of the capacity adder in the market price
calculation will reduce wires charge revenues by the amount of the expected additional revenue from the sale of the displaced capacity in the wholesale market.

Dominion’s fuel factor for sales to Virginia jurisdictional customers will remain unchanged for 2003.

North Carolina—

Dominion’s regulated electric utility cannot request an increase in its North Carolina jurisdictional base rates until 2006, except for certain events that would
have a significant financial impact. Fuel rates, however, are still subject to change under annual proceedings.

Regulated Gas Distribution Operations

Gas Deregulation Legislation

Each of the three states in which Dominion has gas distribution operations has enacted or
considered legislation regarding deregulation of natural gas sales at the retail level.

Ohio—

Ohio has not
enacted legislation requiring supplier choice for residential and commercial natural gas consumers. However, in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (Ohio Commission), Dominion on its own initiative offers retail choice to
customers. At December 31, 2002, approximately 647,000 of Dominion’s 1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in this open-access program. Large industrial customers in Ohio also source their own natural gas supplies.

Pennsylvania—

At December 31, 2002,
approximately 106,000 residential and small commercial customers had opted for Energy Choice in Dominion’s Pennsylvania service area. Nearly all Pennsylvania industrial and large commercial customers buy natural gas from unregulated suppliers.

West Virginia—

At this time, West Virginia has not enacted legislation to require customer choice in its
retail natural gas markets. However, the West Virginia Public Service Commission (West Virginia Commission) has issued regulations to govern pooling services, one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customer choice
in the future. In addition, the West Virginia Commission is developing rules for a code of conduct between utilities and their marketing affiliates, as well as Consumer Protection regulations and Marketer Licensing Rules. In 2002, the West Virginia
Commission proposed rules that require that competitive gas service providers be licensed in West Virginia.

Rate Matters—Gas Distribution

When
necessary, Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia seek general rate increases on a timely basis to recover increased operating costs and to ensure that rates of return are compatible with the cost of
raising capital. In addition to general rate increases, certain gas distribution subsidiaries make routine separate filings with their respective state regulatory commissions to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas. These purchased gas
costs are recovered through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs incurred that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets.

Interstate Gas Transmission Operations

FERC Policy Developments

In October 2002, FERC hosted a public policy conference regarding various short- and long-term issues that impact federal regulation of the natural gas
industry. Among other issues, FERC examined supply and demand forecasts, the adequacy of natural gas infrastructure, regulatory policies applicable to liquefied natural gas facilities, offshore gathering policies, and the flexibility of interstate
pipeline operations. As a result, FERC is considering adjustments to its future regulatory policies concerning the natural gas industry, including modification of its approach to regulation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. The policy change
is intended to encourage additional development of LNG terminals and to increase the availability of imported gas supplies.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

FERC also continues to pursue rulemaking that will eliminate separate standards of conduct regulations for natural gas pipelines and
electric transmission utilities, and replace these requirements with uniform standards applicable to interstate “Transmission Providers.” The proposed standards would redefine the scope of affiliates covered by standards of conduct for
most FERC-regulated companies. If the proposed policy is adopted, it will supersede the existing standards, that are applicable to Dominion. Dominion supports the policy goal to ensure competitive interstate energy markets; however, Dominion has
advocated adjustments to the proposed rules.

Dominion anticipates further action by FERC in early 2003. While Dominion
expects the outcome of a final rule to improve its ability to compete with similarly-situated transmission providers, it does not expect a final rule to have a short-term material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

Rate Matters—Gas Transmission

Dominion implemented various rate filings, tariff changes and negotiated rate service agreements for its FERC-regulated businesses during 2002. In all
material respects, these filings were approved by FERC in the form requested by Dominion and were subject to only minor modifications. Dominion has no significant rate matters pending before FERC at this time.

Merchant Generation Operations

Dominion’s focus in its power generation business is to participate in power generation projects in the MAIN-to-Maine region, with the focus on a
balanced portfolio of generation assets, while maintaining fuel and regional diversity. The region begins at the Mid-America Interconnected Network (MAIN) that includes electric service territories of the upper Midwest and is home to Dominion’s
Kincaid, State Line, and Elwood generating facilities. The target region extends east to Virginia Power’s service territory and north to New England, where Dominion operates its Millstone power station. Dominion is benefiting from the CNG
acquisition, as it is developing and operating natural gas-fired power generation facilities along its natural gas pipeline system. Dominion is in various stages of development for new natural gas-fired power generation facilities throughout the
MAIN-to-Maine region with estimated completion dates from 2003 and beyond.

Exploration and Production Operations

Dominion continues to focus on increasing earnings from gas and oil properties
primarily through acquisition and development activities, exploration, and operating efficiencies. The November 2001 acquisition of Louis Dreyfus represented the addition of significant, long-lived natural gas reserves located in several onshore
United States regions serving

northeast markets. This addition also provided significant new development drilling opportunities, complementing Dominion’s existing development and
exploration activities. The emphasis toward increased acquisition and development activities, as a complement to the higher risk exploration program, was further supported by the 2002 purchase of several onshore properties having additional
development drilling and production enhancement potential.

Pipeline
Operations

Dominion plans to expand its natural gas transmission system with a $497 million, 279-mile interstate pipeline. The Greenbrier
Pipeline will originate in Kanawha County, West Virginia, and extend through southwest Virginia into Granville County, North Carolina. Piedmont Natural Gas is a 33 percent owner in the pipeline project.

Telecommunications Operations

Dominion continues the expansion of its operations as a competitive provider of telecommunications services. These services include providing
facilities-based, high-bandwidth capacity throughout the eastern United States with particular concentration on under-served markets. The future growth of its business will involve adding new customers and revenues, lighting its network, developing
product extensions, and acquiring select assets. Dominion is building a balanced portfolio of customers representing multiple industry segments. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the consolidation of
Dominion’s telecommunications joint venture beginning in February 2003.

Environmental Matters

Dominion is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations
designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and
monitoring obligations. Historically, Dominion recovered such costs arising from regulated electric operations through utility rates. However, to the extent that environmental costs are incurred in connection with operations regulated by the
Virginia Commission, during the period ending June 30, 2007, in excess of the level currently included in the Virginia jurisdictional electric retail rates, Dominion’s results of operations will decrease. After that date, recovery through
regulated rates may be sought for only those environmental costs related to regulated electric transmission and distribution operations. Dominion also may seek recovery through regulated rates for environmental expenditures related to regulated gas
transmission and distribution operations.



Environmental Protection and Monitoring
Expenditures

Dominion incurred approximately $123 million, $116 million and $94 million of expenses (including depreciation) during
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities, and expects these expenses to be approximately $120 million in 2003. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were
$335 million, $221 million and $214 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The estimated amount for these expenditures is $260 million for 2003.

Clean Air Act Compliance

The Clean Air Act requires Dominion to reduce its emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen
oxide (NO

X

), which are gaseous by-products of fossil fuel combustion. The Clean Air Act’s SO


reduction program is based on the issuance of a limited number of SO


emission allowances. Each allowance permits the emission of one ton of SO


into the atmosphere. The allowances may be transacted with a third party. Implementation of projects to comply with SO


and NO

X

limitations are ongoing and will be influenced by changes in the regulatory
environment, availability of allowances, various state and federal control programs, and emission control technology. In response to NO

X

reduction requirements mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for states in which it operates, Dominion plans to install NO

X

reduction equipment by 2005 at its affected coal-fired generating facilities. The installation of this equipment is estimated to cost approximately $715 million, of which $445 million has been incurred
as of December 31, 2002.

EPA is planning to issue additional regulations to address non-attainment of the new ozone and
fine particulate standards within the next few years, as well as ongoing regulatory action associated with regional haze. That regulatory action could require additional reductions in SO


and NO

X

emissions from
Dominion’s fossil fuel-fired generating facilities. In addition, EPA is in the process of developing a proposed standard for mercury emissions for electric utility coal-fired boilers that could require significant mercury emission reductions
from all of Dominion’s coal-fired generating units. If these more stringent emission reduction requirements are imposed in the future, new and perhaps significant expenditures could be required. Dominion cannot predict the future financial
impact of implementing these potential requirements on its operations at this time.

The United States Congress is
considering various “multi-pollutant” legislative proposals that would require fossil-fuel fired generating units to comply with more stringent pollution control standards for air emissions. Many of the proposals would rely upon flexible
cap and trade programs for

compliance and would exempt covered facilities from other Clean Air Act requirements. They would phase-in the emission reduction requirements under a variety of
timeframes, up to 16 years. Dominion cannot predict whether any of these proposals will pass this year or in the future. However, if more stringent emissions standards are ultimately imposed on Dominion’s generating units, new, perhaps
significant, expenditures could be required. Dominion cannot predict the future financial impact on its operations at this time.

During 2000, Virginia Power received a Notice of Violation from EPA, alleging that Virginia Power failed to obtain New Source Review permits under the Clean Air Act prior to undertaking specified construction projects at the Mt.
Storm Power Station in West Virginia. The Attorney General of New York filed a suit against Virginia Power alleging similar violations of the Clean Air Act at the Mt. Storm Power Station. Virginia Power also received notices from the Attorneys
General of Connecticut and New Jersey of their intentions to file suit for similar violations. In December 2002, the Attorney General of Connecticut filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in the action filed by the New York State Attorney
General. This action has been stayed. Management believes that Virginia Power has obtained the necessary permits for its generating facilities. Virginia Power has reached an agreement in principle with the federal government and the state of New
York to resolve this situation. The agreement in principle includes payment of a $5 million civil penalty, a commitment of $14 million for environmental projects in Virginia, West Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, and a 12-year, $1.2
billion capital investment program for environmental improvements at the Company’s coal-fired generating stations in Virginia and West Virginia. Virginia Power had already committed to a substantial portion of the $1.2 billion expenditures for
SO


and NO

x

emissions controls. The negotiations over the terms of a binding settlement have expanded beyond the basic agreement in principle and are ongoing. As of December 31, 2002, Virginia Power has recorded,
on a discounted basis, $18 million for the civil penalty and environmental projects.

In 2002, EPA issued a Section 114
request for information about whether projects undertaken at Virginia Power’s Chesterfield, Chesapeake, Yorktown, Possum Point and Bremo Bluff power stations were properly permitted under the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review requirements,
to which Virginia Power responded in a timely manner.

In 2002, the EPA issued a Section 114 request for information about
whether Morgantown Energy Associates’ (MEA) facility in Morgantown, West Virginia is in



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

compliance with environmental requirements. MEA is a 50 percent-owned equity-method investment. EPA made a site visit and at that time
received the requested information. In September 2002, MEA received a copy of EPA’s inspection report summarizing the facts surrounding the visit. MEA is prepared to resolve follow-up questions from EPA.

Global Climate Change

In 1997, the United States signed an international Protocol to limit man-made greenhouse emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change. However, the Protocol will not become binding unless approved by the U.S. Senate. Currently, the Bush Administration has indicated that it will not pursue ratification of the Protocol, and has set a voluntary goal of reducing the
nation’s greenhouse gas emission intensity by 18 percent over the next ten years. However, the United States Congress is considering legislation that could impose mandatory reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The cost of compliance with the
Protocol or other mandatory greenhouse gas reduction obligations could be significant for Dominion. Given the highly uncertain outcome and timing of future action by the U.S. federal government on this issue, Dominion cannot predict the future
financial impact of climate change action on its operations at this time.

Accounting Matters

The FASB has issued several new standards that will affect Dominion beginning in 2003. These include:
SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

; Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others—An Interpretation of
FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107

; and Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

. In addition, the EITF rescinded EITF Issue No. 98-10. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of the impact of adopting these new accounting standards and information about other standard-setting activities.

Outlook for 2003

Dominion believes its operating
businesses will provide a stable contribution to net income on a per share basis in 2003, with future growth in 2004. However, Dominion’s earnings per share for 2003, on a consolidated basis, will include the effects of the following items:
severance costs under the plan discussed below; fees paid to modify the DFV notes (see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); and the cumulative effect of implementing changes in accounting for asset retirement obligations and energy
trading activities (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The 2003 projections for Dominion’s operating businesses anticipate the following:

n

Higher sales of gas and oil, reflecting continued growth in production and higher realized prices;

n

Improved contributions from Millstone’s operations, resulting from fewer planned outage days and more favorable sales prices;

n

Expected Six Sigma cost savings;

n

Potential decrease in regulated electric sales, as compared to 2002, assuming Dominion’s utility service territories experience a return to normal weather in 2003, partially offset by continued growth in electric utility
customers;

n

Expiration of production tax credits;

n

Lower pension benefit credits; and

n

Increased losses from telecommunications operations.

Based on these
projections, Dominion estimates that cash flow from operations will increase in 2003, as compared to 2002. Such increase, coupled with reductions in discretionary and developmental capital expenditures previously planned for power generation and gas
and oil exploration and production projects, will provide sufficient cash flow to maintain Dominion’s current dividend to common shareholders.

Other Matters

Pension Costs

As discussed in Note 26
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Dominion maintains qualified noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans. Generally, Dominion’s funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with the provisions of the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Investment experience and market conditions, including interest rates, impact the measurement of these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits. Accordingly, assumptions for
discount rates and the expected long-term rate of return on investments are important considerations under SFAS No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.

However, since the objective of SFAS No. 87 is to recognize the cost of providing
benefits over employees’ service period, it permits the delayed recognition of certain elements of retirement plan results.

Dominion has reviewed the assumption used for expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to better reflect anticipated future market conditions and has adopted an expected rate of 8.75 percent for 2003. This change, combined
with other factors such as a revised discount rate assumption of 6.75 percent for 2003, will reduce Dominion’s 2003 pension credit by an estimated $66 million, as compared to 2002. In addition, in order to maintain the funded status of its
retirement plans, Dominion may have to contribute increased amounts to the plans in future years. If, in the future, the accumulated benefit obligations of Dominion’s retirement



plans should exceed the fair value of the plans’ investments at year-end, Dominion would have to recognize a minimum pension liability
for that amount. Furthermore, the recognition of a minimum pension liability would require the elimination of any prepaid pension cost reported on Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at that time, resulting in a charge to other comprehensive
income and a material adverse impact on common shareholders’ equity.

Workforce Reductions

In January 2003, Dominion announced plans to eliminate some union and salaried positions during 2003.
The workforce reductions will affect primarily support positions, including meter readers, supply and warehouse workers and auto mechanics. Many of the reductions result from investments in automated meter-reading technology and the purchases of
newer, lower maintenance vehicles. Affected workers will be offered severance packages, and benefits for union workers will be negotiated during 2003. Pending completion of the process to identify affected positions, Dominion has not estimated the
cost of the workforce reductions.

Expiration of Section
29 Tax Credits

The Internal Revenue Code Section 29 “Credit for the Production of Fuel from Nonconventional Sources” (also
referred to as the production tax credit) allows income tax credits for certain qualified production, including some natural gas, sold before January 1, 2003. Congress has not acted on legislation to extend this credit beyond 2002 for most qualified
production. Whether Congress will take any action to extend the credit during the current term is uncertain. Dominion utilized approximately $36 million of these credits for the year ending December 31, 2002.

Nuclear Relicensing

Dominion filed applications with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for 20-year life-extensions for the North Anna and Surry units in May 2001. The
NRC has completed its review of the applications and Dominion expects to receive a renewed license for these units in 2003.

Dominion has also performed an internal assessment on the probability of a successful license renewal application for both of its operating Millstone units. Based on this assessment and other factors, Dominion has initiated
preparations to apply for a 20-year extension of the licenses for both its operating Millstone units. Dominion expects to file a completed application based on NRC guidelines in 2004.

Nuclear Insurance

The Price Anderson Act expired in August 2002, but operating nuclear reactors would continue to be covered by the law, which would channel and cap claims if a nuclear accident

should occur. The Act has been renewed three times since 1957, and Congress is currently holding hearings to reauthorize the legislation. The expiration of the Act does not impact the coverage of existing nuclear license holders.

Effect of Changes in Commodity Prices

Dominion’s operations are impacted by changes in energy commodity prices. When energy commodities are sold by one of Dominion’s utilities
subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, commodity costs are generally recovered through rates. Market price changes impact Dominion’s revenue from natural gas and oil production and from commodity sales through unregulated subsidiaries.
Dominion has established an enterprise risk management function to evaluate these risks and to recommend actions to management that are intended to mitigate such risks.

Future Acquisitions

Because Dominion’s industry is rapidly changing, there are many opportunities for acquisitions of assets, as well as for business combinations. Dominion investigates any opportunity that may increase shareholder value and build
on existing businesses, with an objective to enter into transactions that would be immediately accretive to earnings per share. Dominion has participated in the past—and its security holders may assume that at any time Dominion may be
participating—in bidding or other negotiations for such transactions. Such participation may or may not result in a transaction for Dominion. However, any such transaction that does take place may involve consideration in the form of cash, debt
or equity securities. It may also involve payment of a premium over book or market values. Such transactions or payments could affect the market prices and rates for Dominion’s securities.

Market Rate Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management

Dominion’s financial instruments, commodity contracts and related derivative instruments are exposed to potential losses due to adverse changes in
interest rates, commodity prices and equity security prices as described below. Interest rate risk generally is related to Dominion’s outstanding debt and financial services activities. Commodity price risk is present in Dominion’s
electric operations, gas production and procurement operations, and energy marketing and trading operations due to the exposure to market shifts for prices received and paid for natural gas, electricity and other commodities. Dominion uses
derivative instruments to manage price risk exposures for these operations. Dominion is exposed to equity price risk through various portfolios of equity securities.

Dominion’s sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations, Continued

instruments over a selected time period due to a 10 percent unfavorable change in interest rates and commodity prices.

Commodity Price Risk—Trading Activities

As part of its strategy to market energy and to manage related risks, Dominion manages a portfolio of commodity-based derivative instruments held for
trading purposes. These contracts are sensitive to changes in the prices of natural gas, electricity and certain other commodities. Dominion uses established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with these price fluctuations and
uses derivative instruments, such as futures, forwards, swaps and options, to mitigate risk by creating offsetting market positions. In addition, Dominion seeks to use its generation capacity, when not needed to serve customers in its service
territory, to satisfy commitments to sell energy.

A hypothetical 10 percent unfavorable change in commodity prices would
have resulted in a decrease of approximately $41 million and $12 million in the fair value of its commodity contracts held for trading purposes as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Commodity Price Risk—Non-Trading Activities

Dominion manages the price risk associated with purchases and sales of natural gas, oil and electricity by using derivative commodity instruments
including futures, forwards, options and swaps. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the fair value of Dominion’s non-trading derivative commodity instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future
periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments. Market prices and volatility are principally determined based on quoted prices on the futures exchange. A hypothetical 10
percent unfavorable change in market prices of Dominion’s non-trading derivative commodity instruments would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of approximately $331 million and $155 million as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
respectively.

The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on Dominion’s non-trading derivative commodity
instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when such contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from derivative commodity instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, are
generally offset by recognition of the hedged transaction, such as revenue from sales.

Interest Rate Risk

Dominion manages its interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a
balance of fixed and variable rate debt. Dominion also enters into interest rate sensitive derivatives, including interest rate swaps and interest rate lock

agreements. In addition,
Dominion, through subsidiaries, retains ownership of mortgage investments, including subordinated bonds and interest-only residual assets retained at securitization of mortgage loans originated and purchased. For financial instruments outstanding at
December 31, 2002, a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would decrease annual earnings by approximately $4 million. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates, as determined at December 31, 2001, would have
resulted in a decrease in annual earnings of approximately $10 million. In addition, Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discussed investments in retained interests from prior securitizations.

Foreign Exchange Risk

Dominion’s Canadian natural gas and oil exploration and production activities are relatively self-contained within Canada. As a result,
Dominion’s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk for these activities is limited primarily to the effects of translation adjustments that arise from including that operation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion’s
management monitors this exposure and believes it is not material. In addition, Dominion manages its foreign exchange risk exposure associated with anticipated future purchases of uranium enrichment services denominated in foreign currencies by
utilizing currency forward contracts. As of result of holding these contracts as hedges, Dominion’s exposure to foreign currency risk is minimal. A hypothetical 10 percent unfavorable change in relevant foreign exchange rates would have
resulted in a decrease of approximately $22 million and $5 million in the fair value of currency forward contracts held by Dominion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Investment Price Risk

Dominion is subject to investment price risk due to marketable securities held as investments in decommissioning trust funds. In accordance with current accounting standards, these marketable securities are reported on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. As described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Dominion recognized net realized and unrealized losses on decommissioning trust investments of $150 million for 2002 and $14 million for
2001.

Dominion also sponsors employee pension and other postretirement benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund
benefit payments. To the extent that the values of investments held in these trusts decline, the effect will be reflected in Dominion’s recognition of the periodic cost of such employee benefit plans and the determination of the amount of cash
to be contributed to the employee benefit



plans. The net realized and unrealized losses on pension trust investments was $241 million for 2002 and $91 million for 2001.

Risk Management Policies

Dominion has operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to help ensure that proper internal controls are maintained. In
addition, Dominion has established an independent function at the corporate level to monitor compliance with the risk management policies of all subsidiaries. Dominion maintains credit policies that include the evaluation of a prospective
counterparty’s financial condition, collateral requirements where deemed necessary, and the use of standardized agreements which facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition, Dominion also monitors the
financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis. Based on credit policies and the December 31, 2002 provision for credit losses, management believes that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the effects of Enron’s bankruptcy on Dominion’s Consolidated
Financial Statements.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT’S
RESPONSIBILITIES

The management of Dominion Resources, Inc. is
responsible for all information and representations contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and other sections of the annual report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Financial Statements, which include amounts based on estimates and
judgments of management, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other financial information in the Form 10-K is consistent with that in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management maintains a system of internal controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that Dominion’s and its subsidiaries’ assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with
established procedures. Management recognizes the inherent limitations of any system of internal control, and therefore cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the established internal controls will be met.

This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to
ensure appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and internal audits. Management believes that during 2002 the system of internal control was adequate to accomplish the intended objectives.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, who were designated by the Board. Their audits were conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and include a review of Dominion’s and its
subsidiaries’ accounting systems, procedures and

internal controls, and the performance of tests and other auditing procedures sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the
Consolidated Financial Statements are not materially misleading and do not contain material errors.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Dominion Resources, Inc., composed entirely of directors who are not officers or employees of Dominion Resources, Inc. or its subsidiaries, meets
periodically with the independent auditors, the internal auditors and management to discuss auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting matters of Dominion and to ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. Both
independent auditors and the internal auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit Committee and have free access to the Committee at any time.

Management recognizes its responsibility for fostering a strong ethical climate so that Dominion’s affairs are conducted according to the highest
standards of personal corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in Dominion’s code of ethics, which addresses potential conflicts of interest, compliance with all domestic and foreign laws, the confidentiality of
proprietary information, and full disclosure of public information.

.    Nature of Operations

Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) is a holding company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Its principal subsidiaries are Virginia Electric and Power Company (Virginia Power), Consolidated Natural Gas Company (CNG), and
Dominion Energy, Inc. (DEI). Dominion and CNG are registered public utility holding companies under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (1935 Act).

Virginia Power is a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity within a 30,000-square-mile area in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Virginia Power sells
electricity to approximately 2.2 million retail customers, including governmental agencies, and to wholesale customers such as rural electric cooperatives, municipalities, power marketers and other utilities. Virginia Power has trading relationships
beyond its retail service territory and buys and sells wholesale electricity and natural gas off-system.

CNG operates in all
phases of the natural gas business. Its regulated retail gas distribution subsidiaries serve approximately 1.7 million residential, commercial and industrial gas sales and transportation customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Its
interstate gas transmission pipeline system serves each of its distribution subsidiaries, non-affiliated utilities and end use customers in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. CNG’s exploration and production operations are located in
several major natural gas and oil producing basins in the United States, both onshore and offshore. CNG also provides a variety of energy marketing services.

DEI is an independent power producer and a natural gas and oil exploration and production company active in the U.S. and Canada.

Dominion has substantially exited the core operating businesses of Dominion Capital, Inc. (DCI), as required by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) under the 1935 Act. Currently, Dominion is required to divest of all remaining DCI holdings by January 2006. DCI’s primary business was financial services, including loan administration, commercial lending and
residential mortgage lending. See Note 6.

Dominion manages its daily operations along three primary operating segments:
Dominion Energy, Dominion Delivery and Dominion Exploration & Production. In addition, Dominion also reports the operations of DCI and its corporate and other operations as a segment. Assets remain wholly owned by its legal subsidiaries. See
Note 32.

The term “Dominion” is used throughout this report and, depending on the context of its use, may
represent any of the following: the legal entity, Dominion Resources, Inc., one

of Dominion Resources, Inc.’s consolidated subsidiaries or the entirety of Dominion Resources, Inc. and
its consolidated subsidiaries.


.    Significant Accounting Policies

General

Dominion makes certain estimates and assumptions in preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles). These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

The Consolidated Financial Statements represent Dominion’s accounts after the elimination of intercompany transactions. Dominion
follows the equity method of accounting for investments with less than a 50 percent interest in partnerships and corporate joint ventures when Dominion is able to influence the financial and operating policies of the investee. For all other
investments, the cost method is applied.

Certain amounts in the 2001 and 2000 Consolidated Financial Statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.

Use of Fair Value
Measurements

Dominion reports certain contracts and instruments at fair value in accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting
principles. Fair value is based on actively quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively quoted market prices, Dominion seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. If
pricing information from external sources is not available, Dominion must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and certain statistical methods, including regression analysis.

For options and contracts with option-like characteristics where pricing information is not available from external sources, Dominion uses
a modified Black-Scholes model and considers time value, the volatility of the underlying commodities and other relevant assumptions when estimating fair value. For contracts with unique characteristics, Dominion estimates fair value using a
discounted cash flow approach deemed appropriate in the circumstances and applied consistently from period to period. If pricing information is not available from external sources, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. For
individual contracts, the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the contract’s estimated fair value.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Operating Revenue

Operating revenue is recorded on the basis of services rendered, commodities delivered or contracts settled and includes amounts yet to be billed to customers. Operating revenue from energy trading activities includes realized
commodity contract revenue, net of related cost of sales, and unrealized gains and losses resulting from marking to market those commodity contracts not yet settled. See Note 7. Beginning October 25, 2002 and January 1, 2003, in accordance with
new accounting requirements discussed further in Note 4, Dominion discontinued marking to market unsettled commodity contracts that are not otherwise accounted for as derivatives under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Electric Fuel, Purchased Energy and Purchased Gas—Deferred Costs

Where permitted by regulatory authorities, the
differences between actual electric fuel, purchased energy and purchased gas expenses and levels of recovery for these expenses in current rates are deferred and matched against recoveries in future periods. See

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

below and Note 19.

Income Taxes

Dominion and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Where permitted by regulatory authorities, the treatment of temporary
differences can differ from the requirements of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

Accordingly, a regulatory asset has been recognized if it is probable that future revenues will be provided for the payment of deferred tax
liabilities. Deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the service lives of the properties giving rise to the credits.

Stock-based Compensation

Dominion sponsors two stock
plans that provide stock-based awards to directors, executives and other key employees. Under the plans, Dominion grants stock options and restricted stock awards that vest over periods ranging from three to five years. Options have contractual
terms that range from seven to ten years. Forty million shares of common stock may be issued under the plans and approximately 12 million of those are available for new grants as of December 31, 2002.

Dominion measures compensation cost for stock-based awards issued to its employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and related interpretations. Compensation expense is measured based on the intrinsic value, the difference between fair market value of Dominion common stock and the exercise price of the
underlying award, on the date when both the price

and number of shares the recipient is entitled to receive are known, generally the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the stated vesting period of the award. See Note 24 for more information on stock-based awards.

The
following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share if Dominion had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, to stock-based employee
compensation:

(1)

Actual stock-based compensation expense reflects primarily the issuance of restricted stock. For 2001, stock-based compensation expense also includes an after-tax charge of
$11 million for stock options modified in the 2001 restructuring initiative discussed in Note 8.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Current banking arrangements generally do not require checks to be funded
until actually presented for payment. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, accounts payable included the net effect of checks outstanding but not yet presented for payment of $101 million and $214 million, respectively. For purposes of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, Dominion considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash on hand, cash in banks and temporary investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less. In December 2002, Dominion deposited
$500 million in escrow to be used solely for repayment of debt maturing in January 2003. Those restricted funds are not included as cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Margin Deposit Assets and Liabilities

Amounts reported as margin deposit assets represent funds held on deposit by various trading counterparties that resulted from Dominion exceeding
agreed-upon credit limits established by the counterparties. Amounts reported as margin deposit liabilities represent funds held by Dominion that resulted from various trading counterparties exceeding agreed- upon credit limits established by
Dominion. These credit limits and the mechanism for calculating the amounts to be held on deposit are determined in the International Swap



Dealers Association master agreements and the Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement of the Edison Electric Institute in place between
Dominion and the counterparties. As of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, Dominion had margin deposit assets of $149 million and $30 million, respectively, and margin deposit liabilities (reported in other current liabilities) of $22 million
and $88 million, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including additions and replacements, is recorded at original cost, including labor, materials, other direct
costs and capitalized interest. The costs of repairs and maintenance, including minor additions and replacements, are charged to expense as incurred. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, Dominion capitalized interest costs of $95 million, $41 million and
$30 million, respectively.

For electric and gas distribution and transmission property subject to cost-of-service utility
rate regulation, the cost of such property and related cost of removal, less salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation at retirement. For generation-related property, cost of removal is charged to expense as incurred. Dominion records gains
and losses upon retirement of generation-related property based upon the difference between proceeds received, if any, and the property’s undepreciated basis at the retirement date.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line method based on projected service lives. Dominion’s
depreciation rates on property, plant and equipment for 2002, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: generation – 2.34 percent, 2.78 percent, 2.79 percent, respectively; transmission – 2.26 percent, 2.58 percent, 2.59 percent, respectively;
distribution – 3.27 percent, 3.43 percent, 3.48 percent, respectively; storage – 2.47 percent, 2.57 percent, 2.61 percent, respectively; gas gathering and processing – 2.31 percent, 2.19 percent, 2.62 percent, respectively; and
general and other – 5.74 percent, 4.94 percent, 5.18 percent, respectively. Amortization of nuclear fuel used in electric generation is provided on a unit-of-production basis sufficient to fully amortize, over the estimated service life, the
cost of the fuel plus permanent storage and disposal costs.

In 2002, Dominion extended the estimated useful lives of
most of its fossil fuel stations and electric transmission and distribution property based on depreciation studies that indicated longer lives were appropriate. These changes in estimated useful lives reduced depreciation expense by $42 million for
the entirety of 2002 and will reduce depreciation expense by approximately $68 million on an annual basis thereafter. In 2001, Dominion increased its estimate of the useful lives of its nuclear facilities by 20 years, which reduced depreciation
expense by $78 million for the entirety of 2001 and approximately $94 million on an annual basis thereafter.

This change in estimate was made in connection with current and planned filings
of applications for re-licensing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Dominion follows the full cost method of
accounting for gas and oil exploration and production activities prescribed by the SEC. Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. The full cost method limits these
capitalized amounts to no more than the present value of estimated future net revenues derived from the production of proved gas and oil reserves as determined under a method established by the SEC (the ceiling test). If net capitalized costs exceed
the ceiling test at the end of any quarterly period, then a permanent write-down of the assets must be recognized in that period. The ceiling test is performed separately for each cost center, with cost centers established on a country-by-country
basis. As currently permitted by the SEC, Dominion uses hedge-adjusted period-end prices to calculate the present value of estimated future net revenues. Such prices are used for the portion of anticipated production from proved reserves that is
hedged by qualifying cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2002, the use of period-end market prices rather than hedge-adjusted prices, as otherwise required by the full cost method, would not have resulted in an impairment charge. Due to the
volatility of gas and oil prices, it is reasonably possible that for some periods, Dominion may satisfy the ceiling test using hedge-adjusted prices, whereas the use of period-end market prices without the effects of hedging could have resulted in
an impairment charge.

Depreciation of gas and oil producing properties is computed using the unit-of-production method.
Under the full cost method of accounting, amortization is also accrued on estimated future costs to be incurred in developing proved gas and oil reserves and on estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of projected salvage values. The
costs of investments in unproved properties are initially excluded from the depreciable base. Until the properties are evaluated, a ratable portion of the capitalized costs is periodically reclassified to the depreciable base, determined on a
property by property basis, over terms of underlying leases. Once a property has been evaluated, any remaining capitalized costs are then transferred to the depreciable base. For a discussion of a change in the accounting for future dismantlement
and abandonment costs, see

Asset Retirement Obligations

in Note 4.

Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

Dominion performs an evaluation for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets or intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. These assets are written down to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than
the carrying amounts.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Investment Securities

Dominion accounts for and classifies investments in marketable equity and debt securities in two categories. Debt and equity securities purchased and held with the intent of selling them in the near term are classified as
trading securities. Trading securities are reported at fair value with net realized and unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. All other debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities. These are reported at
fair value with realized gains and losses included in earnings and unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.

Loans Receivable, Net

Loans receivable are stated at their outstanding principal balance, net of the allowance for credit losses and any deferred fees or costs. Origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an
adjustment of the yield of loans receivable. Each loan is evaluated for impairment by discounting estimated future cash flows at the loan’s original contractual rate. In assessing the recoverability of future cash flows, Dominion management
considers the debtor’s financial strength and market position, general economic conditions and other factors. If it is determined that a loan has become impaired, an additional allowance for credit losses is established through provisions for
credit losses and is charged against income. Loans receivable deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
carrying amount of loans receivable was $87 million and $106 million, respectively, net of the allowance for credit losses of $69 million and $79 million, respectively.

Securitizations by Financial Services Businesses

Prior to being divested, Dominion’s financial services businesses would periodically securitize mortgages and loans. Securitizations resulted from the process of selling loans to unconsolidated special purpose trusts in
exchange for cash and certain retained interests. Retained interests include subordinated bonds or other securities issued by the trusts or interests in the loans sold. Cash proceeds were determined based on the difference between interest rates to
be received on the loans sold and the interest rate to be paid to investors participating in the securitizations. The determination of cash proceeds was also affected by estimates of prepayments, credit losses, servicing costs and non-refundable
fees and premiums. Gains and losses realized on the sale of loans were recognized based on the difference between 1) the carrying amount of the loans sold and 2) the sum of the cash proceeds received and the fair value of interests retained in the
securitization on the settlement date. Fair value was based on the present value of estimated cash flows, adjusted to reflect the effects of credit

losses, prepayments and other factors
appropriate in each securitization. Dominion securitized commercial loans receivable in collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) transactions. Retained interests in CLO and CDO transactions are reported as
available-for-sale securities. In addition, before selling its residential mortgage business, Dominion securitized residential mortgage loans.

Retained interests from the securitization of mortgage loans include interest-only strips, which are recorded, based on the net present value of projected cash flows, using management’s best estimates of key
assumptions. These assumptions include credit losses, prepayment speeds, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Interest-only strips are amortized in proportion to the estimated income received. They are
analyzed quarterly to determine whether prepayment experience, losses and changes in the interest rate environment have had an impact on the valuation. Expected cash flows of the underlying loans sold are reviewed based on current economic
conditions and the types of loans originated and are revised as necessary. See Notes 9 and 13 for more information about Dominion’s investments in retained interests, including the recognition of impairments in 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Derivative Instruments

Dominion uses derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, forwards and options to manage the commodity, currency exchange and financial market risks of
its business operations. Dominion also manages a portfolio of commodity contracts held for trading purposes as part of its strategy to market energy and to manage related risks. Derivative instruments are generally recognized on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at fair value. See Note 15 for further discussion of Dominion’s use of derivative instruments and energy trading contracts, including its risk management policy, its accounting policy for derivatives under SFAS No. 133 and the
results of its hedging activities for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Prior to January 1, 2001, Dominion
considered derivative instruments to be effective hedges when the item being hedged and the underlying financial instrument or commodity contract showed strong historical correlation. Dominion used deferral accounting to account for futures,
forwards and other derivative instruments that were designated as hedges. Under this method, realized gains and losses (including the payment of any premium) related to effective hedges of existing assets and liabilities were recognized in earnings
in conjunction with the designated asset or liability. Gains and losses related to effective hedges of firm commitments and anticipated transactions were included in the measurement of the subsequent transaction.



Goodwill, Net

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, on January 1, 2002, goodwill arising from acquisitions completed before July 1, 2001 was amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to 40
years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Dominion did not amortize goodwill arising from acquisitions initiated after June 30, 2001 and ceased amortization of all goodwill upon adoption of the standard. Dominion evaluates goodwill for impairment on
at least an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. See Note 18 for further discussion of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 and the
goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2002. See Note 5 for discussion of Dominion’s recent significant acquisitions.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

Methods of allocating
costs to accounting periods for operations subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation may differ from accounting methods generally applied by non-regulated companies. The economic effects of allocations prescribed by regulatory
authorities for rate-making purposes must be considered in the application of generally accepted accounting principles. See Notes 19 and 27 for additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact of legislation on continued
application of SFAS No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

.

Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs

Dominion defers and amortizes debt issuance costs and debt premiums or
discounts over the lives of the respective debt issues. As permitted by regulatory authorities, gains or losses resulting from the refinancing of debt allocable to utility operations subject to cost-based rate regulation have also been deferred and
amortized over the lives of the new issues.


.    Accounting Change for Pension Costs

Effective January 1, 2000 and in connection with Dominion’s acquisition of CNG, Dominion adopted a new company-wide method of calculating the market-related value of pension plan assets used to
determine the expected return on pension plan assets, a component of net periodic pension cost. Dominion believes the new method enhances the predictability of the expected return on pension plan assets; provides consistent treatment of all
investment gains and losses; and results in calculated market-related pension plan asset values that are closer to market value than the values calculated under the pre-acquisition methods used by Dominion or CNG.

The $21 million cumulative effect of the change on prior years (net of income taxes of $11 million) was included in

income for the year ended December 31, 2000. The change increased income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for 2000 by $11 million ($0.05 per share-basic and diluted) and net
income by $32 million ($0.14 per share-basic and diluted).


.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Asset Retirement Obligations

In 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143

, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

, which provides accounting requirements for the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets. Dominion adopted the standard effective January 1, 2003.

Dominion has identified certain asset retirement
obligations that are subject to the standard. These obligations are primarily associated with the decommissioning of its nuclear generation facilities, abandoning certain natural gas pipelines and dismantling and removing gas and oil wells and
platforms.

Under SFAS No. 143, asset retirement obligations will be recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized as
part of the cost of the related tangible long-lived assets. Under the present value approach used to estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations, accretion of the liabilities due to the passage of time will be recognized as an operating
expense. As a result, the adoption of SFAS No. 143 requires changes in Dominion’s accounting and reporting for certain asset retirement obligations already being recognized under its accounting policies prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 143.
For example, Dominion recognizes amounts related to future decommissioning activities at its utility nuclear plants. As discussed in Note 16, the accumulated provision for decommissioning is presented on the balance sheet at December 31, 2002 as a
component of accumulated depreciation. Under SFAS No. 143, the asset retirement obligation will be reported as a liability.

In addition, the reporting of realized and unrealized earnings of external trusts available for funding decommissioning activities at Dominion’s utility nuclear plants will be recorded in other income and other comprehensive
income, as appropriate. Through 2002, Dominion recorded these trusts’ earnings in other income with an offsetting charge to expense, also recorded in other income, for the accretion of the decommissioning liability.

On January 1, 2003, Dominion implemented SFAS No. 143 and recognized an after-tax gain of $180 million, representing the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle. Under Dominion’s accounting policy prior to the



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

adoption of SFAS No. 143, $1.6 billion had previously been accrued for future asset removal costs, primarily related to future nuclear
decommissioning. Such amounts are included in the accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion and amortization as of December 31, 2002. With the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Dominion calculated its asset retirement obligations to be $1.5 billion.
In recording the cumulative effect of the accounting change, Dominion recognized the reduction attributable to the re-measurement of asset retirement obligations and reclassified such amount from the accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion
and amortization to other non-current liabilities. The cumulative effect of the accounting change also reflected a $350 million increase in property, plant and equipment for capitalized asset retirement costs and a $90 million increase in the
accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion and amortization, representing the depreciation of such costs through December 31, 2002.

In accordance with SFAS No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

, Dominion will continue its practice of accruing for future costs of removal for its cost-of-service rate regulated gas and electric
utility assets, even if no legal obligation to perform such activities exists. At December 31, 2002, Dominion’s accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization included $596 million, representing the estimated future cost of such removal
activities.

Energy Trading Contracts

In October 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) rescinded EITF Issue No. 98-10,

Accounting for

Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and
Risk Management Activities

(EITF 98-10).

As a result, certain energy-related commodity contracts held for trading purposes will no longer be subject to fair value accounting. The affected contracts are those energy-related contracts held
for trading purposes that are not considered to be derivatives under SFAS No. 133

.

Under EITF 98-10 accounting, the fair value of energy contracts was measured at each reporting date, with changes in fair value, including unrealized amounts,
reported in earnings. Energy-related contracts affected by the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be subject to accrual accounting and recognized as revenue or expense at the time of contract performance, settlement or termination.

The rescission of EITF 98-10 primarily affects the timing of recognition in earnings from Dominion’s energy-related trading
contracts. In addition, affected contracts will no longer be reported at fair value on Dominion’s balance sheet. The EITF 98-10 rescission was effective for all non-derivative energy trading contracts initiated after October 25, 2002. As a
result of implementing the change for all non-derivative energy

trading contracts initiated prior to October 25, 2002, Dominion recognized a loss of $67 million (net of taxes of $43
million) as the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle effective January 1, 2003.

Accounting for Guarantees

In November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others—An Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107

(FIN No. 45). Under FIN No. 45, issuers of certain types of guarantees
must recognize a liability based on the fair value of the guarantee issued, even when the likelihood of making payments is remote. In addition, FIN No. 45 requires increased disclosures for specific types of guarantees.

FIN No. 45’s initial recognition requirements apply only
to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Dominion does not anticipate any material impact on its future results of operations or financial condition as a result of recording newly issued or modified guarantees at fair value. FIN No.
45’s disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements ending after December 15, 2002. See Note 27.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In January
2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, (FIN No. 46) which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity
investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards. These entities have been commonly referred to as “special purpose entities.” The underlying principle behind the new Interpretation is that if a business enterprise has the
majority financial interest in an entity, defined in the guidance as a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in consolidated financial statements with
those of the business enterprise. FIN No. 46 explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. Dominion will apply the provisions of FIN
No. 46 prospectively for all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created before January 31, 2003, Dominion will be required to consolidate all entities in which it was deemed to be the primary
beneficiary beginning July 1, 2003.

As discussed in Note 27, Dominion, through certain subsidiaries, has entered into
agreements with variable interest entities in order to finance and lease several new power generation projects, as well as its corporate headquarters and aircraft. Under existing accounting guidance, neither the project assets nor related
obligations are currently reported on



Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As these variable interest entities are currently structured, Dominion would be determined to be
the primary beneficiary under FIN No. 46 and would be required to consolidate these variable interest entities beginning in the third quarter of 2003. Based upon total project costs incurred through December 31, 2002, consolidation of these variable
interest entities would result in an additional $1.6 billion in property, plant and equipment and related debt. Dominion’s maximum exposure to loss resulting from these agreements is $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2002. This assessment is
based upon total project costs through December 31, 2002 and assumes the property, plant and equipment will have no value at the end of their lease terms, which management believes is highly unlikely. Dominion is considering other financing
structures for these projects in the future that may result in continued off-balance sheet treatment.

As discussed in Note
30, Dominion has a 50 percent membership interest in Dominion Fiber Ventures, LLC (DFV), a telecommunications joint venture with approximately $850 million in total assets at December 31, 2002. Under existing accounting guidance, Dominion’s
investment in this variable interest entity has been accounted for under the equity method. Under FIN No. 46, Dominion would have been determined to be DFV’s primary beneficiary and thus would have been required to consolidate DFV beginning
July 1, 2003. However, as described in Note 30 under

Subsequent Event

, Dominion began consolidating DFV in February 2003 following its acquisition of substantially all of DFV’s outstanding senior notes, which significantly increased
Dominion’s financial interest in DFV. Dominion’s maximum exposure to loss related to its involvement with DFV consists of its $85 million investment in DFV as of December 31, 2002, as well as the $633 million invested in DFV in February
2003 through the acquisition of DFV’s senior notes. In addition, under the joint venture agreements, Dominion must absorb substantially all future DFV operating losses and is exposed to DFV’s obligation for payments to the other DFV
investor, representing a return on its investment.

Dominion, through a Dominion Capital subsidiary, has an interest in a
developer and manufacturer of engineered polymer products. It is likely that Dominion would be determined to be the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity under FIN No. 46. Dominion’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its
involvement with this entity is $44 million at December 31, 2002.

Dominion’s management does not anticipate that the
changes in accounting requirements will impact planned levels of financing or its credit ratings. Dominion does not anticipate that the adoption of FIN No. 46 will have a material impact

on its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Other

SFAS No. 133 Guidance

—In connection with the January 2003 EITF meeting, FASB was requested
to reconsider an interpretation of SFAS No. 133. The interpretation, which is contained in the Derivatives Implementation Group’s C11 guidance, relates to contracts with pricing terms that include broad market indices. In particular, that
guidance discusses whether the pricing in a contract that contains broad market indices (e.g., consumer price index) could qualify as a normal purchase or sale and therefore not be subject to fair value accounting. Dominion has certain power
purchase and sale contracts that are subject to the guidance addressed in the request for reconsideration. Dominion does not expect the effect of implementing any change, that would ultimately be required as a result of the guidance being clarified,
to be material to its results of operations or financial position.

Future Accounting Changes

—FASB’s
standard-setting process is ongoing. Some of the projects currently on FASB’s agenda include: financial instruments, revenue recognition and procedures related to the purchase method of accounting used for business combinations. In the
financial instruments project, FASB is considering whether certain financial instruments should be classified as equity or liabilities on the balance sheet. FASB plans to issue a limited scope statement in 2003. In December 2002, FASB decided to
broaden the scope of this project to include development of guidance related to measuring the fair value of financial instruments. The fair value measurement guidance developed in this project would supersede existing guidance. In establishing its
revenue recognition project, FASB recognized that no comprehensive standard on revenue recognition exists. FASB plans to issue exposure drafts on a comprehensive accounting standard on revenue recognition and related amendments of its concepts
statements in mid-2004 and to finalize the standard and related amendments in 2005. In its project concerned with the purchase method of accounting for business combinations, FASB’s deliberations are expected to consider the following: how to
measure the fair value of the exchange; recognition and measurement of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including pre-acquisition contingencies; and issues related to non-controlling interests. Until new standards have been finalized and
issued by FASB, Dominion cannot determine the impact on the reporting of its operations that may result from any such future changes.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)


.    Acquisitions

Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership

In September 2002, Dominion acquired 100 percent ownership of Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership (Cove Point), a cost-based rate-regulated entity, from a
subsidiary of The Williams Companies for $225 million in cash. Dominion recorded $75 million of goodwill representing the excess of the purchase price over the regulatory basis of Cove Point’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Cove
Point’s assets include a liquefied natural gas import facility located near Baltimore, Maryland that is under reconstruction, a liquefied natural gas storage facility and an approximately 85-mile natural gas pipeline. Dominion expects Cove
Point to become fully operational in 2003. Dominion incurred $33 million of additional development costs during 2002 and expects to incur $84 million of costs in 2003. Cove Point is included in the Dominion Energy operating segment and all of the
goodwill arising from the acquisition has been allocated to that segment for purposes of impairment testing under SFAS No. 142.

Mirant State Line Ventures, Inc.

In June 2002, Dominion
acquired 100 percent ownership of Mirant State Line Ventures, Inc. (State Line) from a subsidiary of Mirant Corporation for $185 million in cash. State Line’s assets include a 515-megawatt coal-fired generation facility located near Hammond,
Indiana. Its operations are included in the Dominion Energy operating segment.

Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp.

In November 2001, Dominion acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Louis
Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp. (Louis Dreyfus), a natural gas and oil exploration and production company headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The aggregate purchase price was $1.8 billion, which consisted of approximately 14 million shares of
Dominion common stock valued at $881 million, $902 million in cash and employee stock options with a fair value on the date of grant of approximately $13 million. Dominion initially recorded $519 million of goodwill, representing the excess of
purchase price over amounts allocated to Louis Dreyfus’ assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocation was completed during the first quarter of 2002 upon receipt of information from outside specialists, increasing
liabilities and goodwill each by $24 million.

The operations of Louis Dreyfus are included in the Dominion Exploration &
Production operating segment. All of the goodwill arising from the acquisition has been allocated to that segment for purposes of impairment testing under SFAS No. 142. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, no goodwill amortization was recorded related
to the acquisition.

Millstone Power Station

In March 2001, Dominion acquired Millstone Power Station (Millstone), a
nuclear power station located in Waterford, Connecticut. The aggregate purchase price was $1.3 billion in cash, consisting of approximately $1.2 billion for plant assets and $105 million for nuclear fuel. Dominion recorded $302 million of
goodwill representing the excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to Millstone’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The operations of Millstone are included in the Dominion Energy operating segment and all of the goodwill
arising from the acquisition has been allocated to that segment for purposes of impairment testing under SFAS No. 142.

CNG

In January 2000, Dominion acquired all of the
outstanding shares of CNG and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. The aggregate purchase price was $6.4 billion, consisting of approximately 87 million shares of Dominion common stock valued at $3.5 billion and
approximately $2.9 billion in cash. Dominion recorded $3.5 billion of goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of CNG’s operations not subject to cost-based rate regulation and the historical carrying
value of CNG’s operations subject to cost-of-service rate regulation. The operations of CNG are reported in Dominion’s Energy, Delivery and Exploration & Production operating segments and the goodwill arising from the CNG acquisition
has been allocated among those segments for purposes of impairment testing under SFAS No. 142.


.    Divestitures

As of December 31, 2002, Dominion had substantially completed its strategy to exit the
core operating businesses of DCI as required by the SEC under the 1935 Act. Currently, Dominion is required to divest of all remaining DCI holdings by January 2006. See Note 9 for charges recognized in connection with the DCI exit strategies in 2001
and 2000. In 2001, Dominion sold Saxon Capital, Inc. and recognized an after-tax loss of $25 million. Under the terms of the sale, Dominion received $116 million in cash, a $25 million note and a non-controlling equity interest that was subsequently
sold for $25 million. In addition, Dominion retained approximately $300 million in retained interests related to prior mortgage loan securitizations. Dominion held $185 million and $269 million of retained interests from mortgage loan
securitizations at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In 2000, Dominion sold $600 million of commercial loans and
transferred $223 million of outstanding commercial



loan commitments. As of December 31, 2002, Dominion held commercial and other loans receivable of $87 million, net of allowances for loan
losses, and $266 million of CLO and CDO-related retained interests. At December 31, 2001, Dominion held commercial and other loans receivable of $106 million, net of allowances for loan losses, and $268 million of CLO and CDO-related retained
interests.

In 2000, Dominion completed the sales of Virginia Natural Gas, Inc. and CNG International’s Argentine assets
for $678 million. Representing assets held for sale from the CNG acquisition, those transactions did not result in the recognition of any gain or loss. Also in 2000, Dominion completed the sale of its interest in Corby Power Limited for $78 million,
resulting in an after-tax gain of $13 million. Dominion completed the sale of its interests in electric generation capacity in Latin America for $405 million in 2000 and 1999, for which Dominion recognized an after-tax impairment loss of $21 million
in 1999.


.    Operating Revenue

The
primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue include:

Regulated electric sales

consist primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales and federally regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services subject to cost-of-service rate regulation.

Regulated gas sales

consist primarily of state-regulated retail natural gas sales and related distribution services.

Nonregulated electric sales

consist primarily of sales of electricity from utility, independent power
production and merchant nuclear plant resources at market-based rates and net operating revenue from electric trading activities.

Nonregulated gas sales

consist primarily of sales of natural gas at market-based rates, brokered gas sales and net operating revenue from gas trading activities. Natural gas sold includes gas produced by Dominion as well as
purchased gas.

Gas transportation and storage

consists primarily of federally-regulated sales of gathering,
transmission,

distribution and storage services. Also included are gas distribution charges to retail distribution service customers opting for alternate suppliers.

Gas and oil production

consists primarily of sales of natural gas, oil and condensate produced by Dominion. Gas and oil
production revenue is reported net of royalties.

Other revenue

consists primarily of miscellaneous service
revenue from electric and gas distribution operations; sales of coal, brokered oil and other extracted products; gas and oil processing; gas transmission capacity release; and interest and other income from financial services operations.

Dominion’s customer accounts receivable at December 31, 2002 and 2001 included $334 million and $307 million,
respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated electric energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its utility customers. Considering historical usage and applicable customer rates, Dominion estimates unbilled utility
revenue based on weather factors and, for electric customers, total daily electric generation supplied after adjusting for estimated losses of energy during transmission.


.    Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Activities

2001 Restructuring Costs

In the fourth quarter of 2001, after fully integrating CNG’s organization and operations with those of Dominion, management initiated a focused
review of Dominion’s combined operations and developed a plan of reorganization. As a result, Dominion recognized $105 million of restructuring costs which included employee severance and termination benefits and the abandonment of leased
office space no longer needed. In addition, restructuring charges included approximately $46 million related to departing employees for modifications of stock options, special termination benefits and losses related to the settlement of the
related nonqualified pension obligation and plan curtailment attributable to reductions in expected future years of service of plan participants. See Note 26.

Under the 2001 restructuring plan, Dominion identified approximately 340 salaried positions to be eliminated and recorded $42 million in employee severance-related costs. Severance payments were based
on the individual’s base salary and years of service at the time of termination. In 2002, Dominion recorded an $8 million adjustment to the liability for severance and related costs and reported it in restructuring and other acquisition-related
costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income. With 303 positions actually being eliminated under the plan, the adjustment reflected a reduction in the number of employee positions being



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

eliminated and a reduction for differences between actual and estimated base salaries and years of service for those employees actually
terminated under the plan.

Restructuring and related costs for the year ended December 31, 2001 were as follows:

The
change in the liabilities for severance and related costs and lease termination costs during 2002 is presented below:

2000 Restructuring and
Acquisition-Related Activities

During 2000, Dominion incurred charges associated with the divestiture of certain businesses and the
implementation of a restructuring plan for the operations of Dominion and its subsidiaries. The divestitures and restructuring plans were driven by certain requirements associated with the CNG acquisition and a focus on operations in the region that
begins at the Mid-America Interconnected Network (MAIN) and extends north-eastward through Maine (MAIN-to-Maine). The restructuring plan included an involuntary severance program, a voluntary early retirement program (ERP) and a transition plan to
consolidate operations after the CNG acquisition.

For the year ended December 31, 2000, Dominion recorded $460 million of
restructuring and acquisition-related costs, including those incurred from exiting certain businesses of DCI, as follows:

Employee Severance Programs—

As a result of the 2000 restructuring activities, Dominion eliminated 750 salaried positions. Severance payments were based on the individual’s

base salary and years-of-service at the time of termination. In addition, severance payments were provided to employees at DCI who were terminated as part of Dominion’s strategy to exit certain businesses of DCI. At
December 31, 2001, $3 million of severance and related benefit costs accrued under the plan had not yet been paid; such amounts were paid during 2002.

Change in Risk Management Strategy—

During the first quarter of 2000, Dominion created an enterprise risk management group with responsibility for managing Dominion’s aggregate
energy portfolio, including the related commodity price risk, across its consolidated operations. In connection with this change in risk management strategy, management evaluated CNG’s hedging strategy in relation to Dominion’s combined
operations and designated CNG’s portfolio of derivative contracts that existed on January 28, 2000, as held for purposes other than hedging for accounting purposes. This action required a change to mark-to-market accounting and resulted in $55
million of losses recognized in the first quarter of 2000 before Dominion had either financially settled the contracts or had entered into offsetting contracts.

Other—

Restructuring and other acquisition-related costs included amounts paid to employees to retain their services during the post-acquisition transition period, amounts payable
under certain employee contracts and information technology systems and operations integration costs. The information technology costs included excess amortization expense attributable to shortening the useful lives of capitalized software being
impacted by systems integration and related conversion costs. Dominion also incurred lease termination and restructuring costs as a result of the consolidation of operations.


.    Impairment Losses—DCI Operations

In 2002, Dominion recognized impairment losses of $24 million
($16 million after-tax) on its retained interests in mortgage securitizations and goodwill associated with a DCI subsidiary. These impairment losses were reported in other operations and maintenance expenses. See Note 18 for a discussion of the
goodwill impairment. In 2001, Dominion recognized impairment losses of $281 million on various investments at DCI and reported the losses in other operations and maintenance expenses. These charges, after-tax, reduced 2001 net income by
$183 million. In 2000, Dominion recognized impairment losses of $291 million, of which $172 million was determined to be attributable to Dominion’s DCI exit strategy and were included in restructuring and other acquisition-related
costs. The remaining $119 million of impairment charges were related to normal operations of DCI



and are included in other operations and maintenance expenses. See Notes 6, 8 and 13. These charges, after-tax, reduced 2000 net income by
$186 million. The 2002, 2001 and 2000 impairments are reflected in the Corporate and Other operating segment. See Note 32.

The table below presents a summary of the impairment losses recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000:

Retained Interests—Mortgage,
CLO and CDO Securitizations

As part of routine quarterly reviews of its retained interests in mortgage securitizations during the fourth
quarter of 2002, Dominion revised its prepayment speed assumptions for estimating fair values and, as a result, recognized an $11 million write-down of the carrying values of those investments. During its review of its retained interests in
mortgage, CLO and CDO securitizations in 2001, Dominion considered the following: historical performance of its securitized pools; recent prepayment and credit loss experience of loans in those pools; other industry data; and economic factors
prevailing in the U.S. economy, particularly conditions brought about by the September 11, 2001 events and the mortgage interest rate environment at the time of the assessment. In light of actual credit loss experience and actual prepayment activity
of certain mortgage and commercial loans in the securitization trusts, Dominion increased its credit loss and prepayment speed assumptions used to estimate the fair value of its retained interests in mortgage, CLO and CDO securitizations. With these
changes in estimates, Dominion recognized a write-down of the carrying values of its retained interests in mortgage and CLO and CDO securitizations of $21 million and $81 million, respectively. During the first half of 2000, in response to changes
in market conditions, Dominion increased the discount rate used to value the interest-only strips included in its retained interests in mortgage securitizations from 12 percent to 17 percent and recognized a loss of $106 million. See Note 13 for
significant credit loss, prepayment and discount rate assumptions.

Loans
and Other Investments

The other impairments and loss provisions in 2001 reflect Dominion’s current estimate of net realizable values
considering the dramatically weakened economy and increasing instances of bankruptcies, defaults and major restructurings that significantly diminished investment values.

Dominion’s
valuation methodologies and assumptions vary by investment and include cash flow analysis, signed contracts, independent third-party appraisals and, in certain cases, liquidation value.

Income Taxes

Income before provision for income taxes, classified by source of income, before minority interests,
was as follows:

Details
of income tax expense were as follows:



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to the effective income tax
rates as follows:

(1)

Dominion’s effective income tax rate decreased, reflecting the effect of including certain subsidiaries in Dominion’s consolidated state income tax returns. In
addition, the effective tax rate decreased for foreign earnings, the impact of discontinuing goodwill amortization for book purposes and other factors.

(2)

Dominion’s effective income tax rate increased in 2001 due to its utility operations in Virginia becoming subject to state income taxes in lieu of gross receipts taxes,
higher effective rates associated with foreign earnings and higher pretax income in relation to nonconventional fuel tax credits realized.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Dominion’s net deferred taxes consist of the following:

(1)

For 2002 and 2001, total net deferred income tax liabilities include $89 million and $121 million, respectively, of current deferred tax assets reported in other current
assets.

At December 31, 2002,
Dominion had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $107 million. These carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized between 2003 and 2007. These amounts resulted from the acquisition of subsidiaries.


.    Earnings Per Share

The following table presents Dominion’s basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculation:

(1)

Represents the effect of “in-the-money” stock options on the calculation of average outstanding shares of common stock.


.    Inventories

At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
stored gas inventory used in local gas distribution operations was valued at $52 million and $84 million, respectively, under the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. Based on the average price of gas purchased during 2002, the current cost of replacing
the current portion of stored gas inventory exceeded the amount stated on a LIFO basis by approximately $163 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the stored gas inventory of certain of Dominion’s nonregulated gas operations was valued at
$179 million and $98 million, respectively, using primarily the weighted average cost method.

A portion of gas in
underground storage used as a pressure base and for operational balancing was included in property, plant and equipment in the amount of $124 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. Property, plant and equipment also reflected a reduction for volumes
temporarily withdrawn from storage and valued at replacement costs of $53 million and $25 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Materials and supplies and fossil fuel inventories are valued using primarily the weighted average cost method.


.    Securitization of Financial Assets

In prior years, Dominion sold residential mortgage loans and
commercial loans in securitization transactions. In those securitizations, Dominion retained servicing responsibilities



and interests which are subordinate to the interests of investors participating in the securitizations. The investors and the securitization
trusts have no recourse to Dominion’s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. In 2001 and 2000, Dominion recognized pretax gains of $21 million and $85 million, respectively, on the securitization of residential mortgage loans.

Dominion’s retained interests in mortgage securitizations were based on rights to annual servicing fees approximating
50 basis points of the outstanding balance and rights to future cash flows from the performance of the loan portfolios after the investors in the securitization trusts have received their contracted return. In addition, Dominion will continue to
receive future cash flows from prepayment penalties on mortgage loans that payoff during the contractual penalty period. The value of the retained interests is subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risks related to the mortgage loans sold.
For CLOs, Dominion receives annual servicing fees of 38 basis points of the outstanding balance and rights to future cash flows after the investors in the securitization trusts have received their contracted return. The estimated fair value of
Dominion’s retained interests at the time of the 2001 and 2000 securitizations was based on expected cash flow recoveries from the loan portfolios. The majority of the commercial loans securitized were variable rate loans. As a result, changes
in interest rates will not cause a material change in the performance of the loan portfolios. See Notes 2 and 9 for a discussion of Dominion’s accounting policy for securitizations and the outcome of routine quarterly reviews of retained
interests in mortgage, CLO and CDO securitizations during 2002, 2001 and 2000 and related impairment charges.

Activity for the retained interests from securitizations of mortgage loans, including interest-only strips and servicing rights, and the
CLO and CDO retained interests is summarized as follows:

(1)

Includes prepayment penalties.

(2)

Dominion sold all of its servicing rights as part of its sale of Saxon Mortgage in 2001.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Presented below are the fair values of Dominion’s retained interests and related
key economic assumptions as of December 31, 2002 and the sensitivity of the retained interests’ fair value to adverse changes of 10 percent and 20 percent in those assumptions:

(1)

Fixed rate loans ramp up to 25 constant prepayment rate (CPR) over 16 months. Adjustable rate loans ramp up to 65 CPR over 16 months, ramping down to 40 CPR over 12 months.
Second liens ramp up to 35 CPR over 16 months, ramping down to 22 CPR over 26 months. Two-year hybrid loans ramp up to 32 CPR over 14 months; ramping up to 65 CPR in month 25; ramping to 31 CPR over 7 months. Three-year hybrid loans ramp up to 32
CPR over 14 months; ramping up to 60 CPR in month 37; ramping down to 31 CPR over 7 months.

(2)

Defaults occur at the beginning of each period. They are applied on constant percentage to the period’s beginning collateral balance.

(3)

Assets rated Caa1 and lower are defaulted using a cumulative default rate (CDR) vector based upon Moody’s Cumulative Default Rates for Caa1-C securities. A 2 percent
per annum CDR is applied to remaining assets with ongoing recoveries of 40 percent and 80 percent on bonds and loans, respectively.

(4)

Based on the full forward 1-month LIBOR, 6-month LIBOR or 1-year constant maturity treasury rate through January 1, 2006 based on the variable component of the variable rate
contracts.

These sensitivities
are hypothetical. Changes in fair value based on a 10 percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a
variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interests was calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another factor which might magnify or counteract the
sensitivities. For example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses.


.    Investment Securities

Dominion holds marketable debt and equity securities classified as
available-for-sale. Those investments are reported as available-for-sale securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Investments. In addition, the Millstone nuclear decommissioning trust funds holds marketable debt

and equity securities classified as available-for-sale. See Note 16 for additional disclosure of Dominion’s accounting for the Millstone decommissioning trusts. Available-for-sale securities as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001 are summarized below:

Debt
securities backed by mortgages and loans do not have stated contractual maturities as borrowers have the right to call or repay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. At December 31, 2002, these debt securities totaled $448
million. See Note 13 for a discussion of the assumed weighted average life of those investments. The fair value of all other debt securities at December 31, 2002 by contractual maturity are as follows:

Proceeds
from sales of available-for-sale securities were $577 million for 2002, $484 million for 2001 and $3 million for 2000. Realized gains associated with sales of available-for-sale securities totaled $58 million for 2002, $18 million for 2001 and $1
million for 2000. Realized losses on those sales totaled $58 million, $4 million and $6 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Beginning in 2001, proceeds and realized gains and losses included activity in the Millstone nuclear
decommissioning trusts. The cost of these securities was determined on a specific identification basis. For 2002, Dominion recognized net unrealized losses of $5 million on trading securities, other than those associated with its retained interests
from previously securitized mortgages, which are discussed below. For 2001 and 2000, net unrealized holding gains on trading securities increased pre-tax earnings by $21 million and $6 million, respectively. Net unrealized holding gains for 2000
included a $14 million loss relating to the reclassification of certain available-for-sale securities to the trading category.



During the second quarter of 2002, Dominion evaluated its ability to sell its retained
interests from previously securitized mortgages. The evaluation process included discussions with various investment advisors, securitizers of mortgages and others in the mortgage industry. The result of that evaluation was that the retained
interests were not readily marketable on terms that would be acceptable to Dominion. Therefore, during the second quarter of 2002, Dominion reclassified its retained interests from trading to available-for-sale. While classifying the retained
interests as trading, Dominion recognized $5 million of net realized and unrealized pre-tax losses in earnings through May 1, 2002. Beginning on May 1, 2002, unrealized gains and losses on the retained interests were recorded in other
comprehensive income.


.   Derivative Instruments, Hedge Accounting and Energy Trading Activities

Adoption of SFAS No. 133

Dominion adopted SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 and recorded an after-tax
charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $183 million, net of taxes of $106 million.

Risk Management Policy

Dominion uses derivative instruments to manage the commodity and financial
market risks of its business operations. Dominion manages the price risk associated with purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas and oil by using derivative instruments including futures, forwards, swaps and options. Dominion manages the
foreign exchange risk associated with anticipated future purchases denominated in foreign currencies through currency forward contracts. Dominion also manages its interest rate risk exposure, in part, by entering into interest rate swap
transactions.

As part of its strategy to market energy and to manage related risks, Dominion manages a portfolio of
commodity-based derivative instruments held for trading purposes. These contracts are sensitive to changes in the prices of energy commodities, primarily natural gas and electricity. Dominion uses established policies and procedures to manage the
risks associated with these price fluctuations and uses various derivative instruments, such as futures, swaps and options, to reduce risk by creating offsetting market positions. Dominion has operating procedures in place that are administered by
experienced management to help ensure that proper internal controls are maintained regarding the use of derivative instruments. In addition, Dominion has established an independent function to monitor compliance with the risk management policies of
all subsidiaries.

Dominion designates a
substantial portion of derivative instruments held for purposes other than trading as fair value or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. A significant portion of Dominion’s hedge strategies represents cash flow hedges of the variable price
risk associated with the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, oil and other commodities. Dominion also uses cash flow hedge strategies to hedge the variability in foreign exchange rates and variable interest rates on long-term debt. In its
cash flow hedges, Dominion uses the derivative instruments discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Dominion also engages in fair value hedges by using natural gas swaps, futures and options to mitigate the fixed price exposure inherent in its firm
commodity commitments. In addition, Dominion has designated interest rate swaps as fair value hedges to manage its exposure to fixed interest rates on certain long-term debt. Certain non-trading derivative instruments are not designated as hedges
for accounting purposes. However, management believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates.

Accounting Policy

Under
SFAS No. 133, derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless an exception is available under the standard. Certain qualifying derivative contracts have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales
contracts. These contracts are not reported at fair value, as otherwise required by SFAS No. 133.

Commodity contracts
representing unrealized gain positions are reported as derivative and energy trading assets; commodity contracts representing unrealized losses are reported as derivative and energy trading liabilities. In addition, purchased options and options
sold are reported as derivative and energy trading assets and derivative and energy trading liabilities, respectively, at estimated market value until exercise or expiration.

For all derivatives designated as hedges, Dominion formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item,
as well as the risk management objective and strategy for using the hedging instrument. Dominion assesses whether the hedge relationship between the derivative and the hedged item is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows
both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Any change in fair value of the derivative that is not effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item is recognized currently in earnings. Dominion discontinues hedge
accounting prospectively for derivatives that have ceased to be highly effective hedges.

For fair value hedge transactions
in which Dominion is hedging changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

commitment, changes in the fair value of the derivative will generally be offset in the Consolidated Statements of Income by changes in the
hedged item’s fair value. For cash flow hedge transactions in which Dominion is hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-priced asset, liability, commitment or forecasted transaction, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are reported in AOCI. Derivative gains and losses reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portions of the change
in fair value of derivatives and the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in current period earnings. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge
effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. For options designated either as fair value or cash flow hedges, changes in time value are excluded from the
measurement of hedge effectiveness and are therefore recorded in earnings.

Gains and losses on derivatives designated as
hedges, when recognized, are included in operating revenue, expenses or interest and related charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Specific line item classification is determined based on the nature of the risk underlying individual
hedge strategies. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of hedging derivatives excluded from the measurement of effectiveness are included in other operation and maintenance expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Cash flows resulting from the settlement of derivatives used as hedging instruments are included in net cash flows from operating activities.

Derivatives and Hedge Accounting Results

In the Consolidated Statements of Income, Dominion recognized pre-tax gains (losses) related to hedge ineffectiveness and changes in time value of options excluded from the measurement of hedge effectiveness, as follows:

The following table presents selected information related to cash flow hedges included in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2002:

The
actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings in 2003 will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in market prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The effect of amounts being reclassified from AOCI
to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transactions (e.g., anticipated sales) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies.

Energy Trading Activities

Dominion’s non-derivative energy contracts initiated before October 25, 2002 and derivative instruments held for energy trading purposes are reported at fair value, with corresponding changes in
value recognized immediately in earnings. See Note 4 for discussion of recent changes impacting the fair value accounting for energy trading contracts. Net gains and losses associated with Dominion’s commodity trading purchases and sales are
presented net as nonregulated electric sales and nonregulated gas sales revenue. Cash flows resulting from the settlement of energy trading contracts are included in net cash flows from operating activities. The composition of operating revenue from
commodity trading activities for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 follows:

Enron Bankruptcy

Based on management’s evaluation of the estimated collectibility of amounts due from Enron Corp. and certain of



its subsidiaries (Enron) and the valuation of Enron-related commodity contracts, Dominion recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of
approximately $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. This charge was comprised of approximately $9 million for net credit exposure on past energy sales to Enron for which payment has not been received and approximately $142 million related to
the impaired fair value of natural gas forward and swap contracts with Enron. Management continues to believe that this charge substantially eliminates any further Enron-related earnings exposure.

During 2002, Dominion terminated all outstanding and open positions with Enron. Dominion has submitted a claim in the Enron bankruptcy
case for the value of such contracts, measured at the effective dates of contract termination. Various contingencies, including developments in the Enron bankruptcy proceedings, may affect Dominion’s ultimate exposure to Enron.

Concurrent with the December 2, 2001 Enron bankruptcy filing, Dominion’s Enron derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of
anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas no longer qualified for hedge accounting and, accordingly, were de-designated from their hedging relationships for accounting purposes.


.    Nuclear Operations

Dominion has a total of six licensed, operating nuclear reactors at its Surry
and North Anna plants in Virginia and its Millstone plant in Connecticut. Surry and North Anna serve customers of Dominion’s regulated electric utility operations. Millstone is a non-regulated merchant plant with two operating units. A third
Millstone unit ceased operations before Dominion acquired the plant. See Notes 5 and 17 regarding the acquisition of Millstone and other information regarding jointly owned utility plants.

Decommissioning represents the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power plant, once operations have
ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. Through June 2007, amounts are being collected from Virginia jurisdictional ratepayers and placed in external trusts and invested to fund the expected costs of decommissioning the Surry
and North Anna units. As part of its acquisition of Millstone, Dominion acquired the decommissioning trusts for the three units that were fully funded to the regulatory minimum as of the acquisition date. Currently, Dominion believes that the
amounts available in the trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone units, without any additional contributions to the trusts.

Accounting
for Decommissioning

Utility Nuclear Plants—

In accordance with the accounting policy recognized by regulatory authorities
having jurisdiction over its electric utility operations, Dominion recognizes an expense for the future cost of decommissioning in amounts equal to amounts collected from ratepayers and earnings on trust investments dedicated to funding the
decommissioning of Dominion’s utility nuclear plants. On the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the external trusts are reported at fair value with the accumulated provision for decommissioning included in accumulated depreciation. Net realized and
unrealized earnings on the trust investments, as well as an offsetting expense to increase the accumulated provision for decommissioning, are recorded as a component of other income (loss) as permitted by regulatory authorities.

The balance of investments held in external trusts for Surry and North Anna decommissioning as well as the accumulated provision for
decommissioning at December 31, 2002 and 2001, was $838 million and $858 million, respectively.

Dominion collected $36
million from ratepayers in each of the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000 and expensed like amounts as a component of depreciation. Dominion recognized net realized gains and interest income of $11 million, $32 million and $20 million for 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. Dominion recognized net unrealized losses of $67 million, $61 million and $23 million, for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Dominion recognized offsetting increases or decreases to its provision for decommissioning in
amounts equal to net realized and unrealized gains or losses for each period.

Merchant Nuclear Plant—

The
external trusts that hold investments dedicated to funding the decommissioning of Dominion’s merchant nuclear plant are classified as available for sale and reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. See Note 14. The balance of
investments held in external trusts for Millstone decommissioning at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $761 million and $839 million, respectively.

The accumulated provision for decommissioning, which is included in accumulated depreciation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was recorded upon the acquisition of Millstone at its estimated fair value using discounted
cash flows of expected costs to perform the decommissioning activities. The balance of the accumulated provision for Millstone decommissioning was $700 million and $660 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The accretion of the provision for decommissioning is expensed as a component of depreciation and was $40 million and $30 million for the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Dominion realized net gains and interest income on trust investments of $21 million and $37 million in



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

2002 and 2001, respectively, and recorded such gains in other income. Dominion recorded unrealized losses on the decommissioning trusts of
$99 million in 2002 in other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses on the decommissioning trust in 2001 were less than $1 million.

See Note 4 for a discussion of the adoption of SFAS No. 143 which will affect Dominion’s accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

Expected Costs for Decommissioning

The total estimated
current cost to decommission Dominion’s seven nuclear units is $3.1 billion based on site-specific studies completed in 2002. Dominion expects to perform new cost studies in 2006. For all units except Millstone Unit 1, the current cost
estimates assume decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations, which will occur when operating licenses expire. Millstone Unit 1 is not in service and will be monitored until decommissioning activities begin for the
remaining Millstone units. The current operating licenses expire in the years detailed in the following table. However, Dominion filed a request with the NRC in 2001 for a 20-year life extension for the Surry and North Anna units and expects to file
a similar request for the Millstone units in 2004. Dominion expects to decommission the Surry and North Anna units during the period 2032 to 2045 and the Millstone units during the period 2050 to 2055.

(1)

Unit 1 ceased operations in 1998 before Dominion’s acquisition of Millstone.

The NRC requires nuclear power plant owners to annually update minimum financial assurance amounts for the
future decommissioning of the nuclear facilities. Dominion’s 2002 NRC minimum financial assurance amount, aggregated for the nuclear units, was $2.1 billion and has been satisfied by a combination of surety bonds and the funds being collected
and deposited in the external trusts. Beginning in March 2003, Dominion expects to substitute a guarantee to replace the surety bonds currently being utilized.

Insurance

The
Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability of a nuclear plant owner to $9.5 billion for a single nuclear incident. The Price-Anderson Act Amendment of 1988 allows for an

inflationary
provision adjustment every five years. Dominion has purchased $200 million of coverage from commercial insurance pools with the remainder provided through a mandatory industry risk-sharing program. In the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed
nuclear reactor in the United States, Dominion could be assessed up to $88 million for each of its seven licensed reactors, not to exceed $10 million per year per reactor. There is no limit to the number of incidents for which this retrospective
premium can be assessed.

The Price-Anderson Act was first enacted in 1957 and has been renewed three times—in 1967,
1975 and 1988. Price-Anderson expired August 1, 2002, but operating nuclear reactors continue to be covered by the law. Congress is currently holding hearings to reauthorize the legislation. The expiration of the Price-Anderson Act has no impact on
existing nuclear license holders.

Dominion’s current level of property insurance coverage ($2.55 billion for North
Anna, $2.55 billion for Surry and $2.75 billion for Millstone) exceeds the NRC’s minimum requirement for nuclear power plant licensees of $1.06 billion per reactor site and includes coverage for premature decommissioning and functional total
loss. The NRC requires that the proceeds from this insurance be used first to return the reactor to and maintain it in a safe and stable condition and second to decontaminate the reactor and station site in accordance with a plan approved by the
NRC. Dominion’s nuclear property insurance is provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurance company, and is subject to retrospective premium assessments in any policy year in which losses exceed the funds available
to the insurance company. The maximum assessment for the current policy period is $70 million. Based on the severity of the incident, the board of directors of Dominion’s nuclear insurer has the discretion to lower or eliminate the maximum
retrospective premium assessment. Dominion has the financial responsibility for any losses that exceed the limits or for which insurance proceeds are not available because they must first be used for stabilization and decontamination.

Dominion also purchases insurance from NEIL to cover the cost of replacement power during the prolonged outage of a nuclear unit due to
direct physical damage of the unit. Under this program, Dominion is subject to a retrospective premium assessment for any policy year in which losses exceed funds available to NEIL. The current policy period’s maximum assessment is $29 million.

Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, a part owner of the North Anna Power Station, and Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale
Electric Company and Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, part owners of Millstone’s Unit 3, are responsible for their share of the nuclear decommissioning



obligations and insurance premiums on applicable units, including any retrospective premium assessments and any losses not covered by
insurance.


.    Property, Plant and Equipment

Major
classes of property, plant and equipment and their respective balances are:

Costs of
unproved properties capitalized under the full cost method of accounting that are excluded from amortization at December 31, 2002, and the years in which such excluded costs were incurred, follow:

Amortization rates for capitalized costs under the full cost method of accounting for Dominion’s United States and Canadian cost centers were as follows:

Dominion’s proportionate share of jointly-owned utility plants at December 31, 2002 follows:

The
co-owners are obligated to pay their share of all future construction expenditures and operating costs of the jointly-owned facilities in the same proportions as their respective ownership interest. Dominion reports its share of operating costs in
the appropriate expense category in the Consolidated Statements of Income.


.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 142, which prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. SFAS No. 142 also
requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Dominion adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002
and completed its transitional and annual goodwill impairment tests during the second quarter of 2002, finding no instances of impairment. The discontinuance of goodwill amortization under SFAS No. 142 resulted in an increase in net income of $95
million in 2002.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Had the provisions of SFAS No. 142 requiring the discontinuance of goodwill
amortization been applied for 2001 and 2000, Dominion’s net income and earnings per share would have been as follows:

In
November 2002, a DCI subsidiary received an unfavorable arbitration ruling that affected its ability to recover disputed amounts for past and future performance under a contract with a major customer. Accordingly, Dominion performed a goodwill
impairment test, using discounted cash flow analysis and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the DCI reporting unit.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2002, are as follows:

All of
Dominion’s intangible assets, other than goodwill, are subject to amortization. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $53 million, $44 million and $34 million

for 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. There were no material acquisitions of intangible assets during 2002. The components of intangible assets at December 31, 2002 were as follows:

Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $56 million for 2003, $52 million for 2004, $46 million for 2005, $43 million for 2006 and $36 million for 2007.


.    Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

Regulatory
assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are to
be credited to customers through the ratemaking process.

In 1999, Virginia enacted the Virginia Electric Utility
Restructuring Act (the Virginia Restructuring Act) that established a detailed plan to restructure Virginia’s electric utility industry. Under the Virginia Restructuring Act, the generation portion of Dominion’s Virginia jurisdictional
operations is no longer subject to cost-based regulation, effective January 1, 2002. The legislation’s deregulation of generation was an event that required the discontinuance of SFAS No. 71 for Dominion’s generation operations in
1999.



Dominion’s regulatory assets and liabilities included the following at December
31, 2002 and 2001:

(1)

Costs recognized in excess of amounts included in regulated rates charged by Dominion’s regulated gas operations before rates were updated to reflect the new method of
accounting and the cost related to the accrued benefit obligation recognized as part of Dominion’s accounting for its acquisition of CNG.

(2)

Income taxes recoverable through future rates resulting from the recognition of additional deferred income taxes, not previously recorded because of past ratemaking practices.

(3)

Cost of decommissioning the Department of Energy’s uranium enrichment facilities, representing the unamortized portion of Dominion’s required
contributions. Beginning in 1992, Dominion began making contributions over a 15-year period and collecting these costs in electric customers’ fuel rates.

(4)

In 2001 the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio authorized the deferral of costs associated with certain uncollectible customer accounts not contemplated by current
rates. Dominion expects recovery of such costs, which will be included in Dominion’s next base rate case.

(5)

Estimated rate contingencies and refunds are associated with certain increases in prices by Dominion’s rate regulated utilities and other rate-making issues that are
subject to final modification in regulatory proceedings.

The incurred costs underlying regulatory assets may represent past expenditures by Dominion’s rate regulated electric and gas operations or may represent the recognition of liabilities that ultimately will be settled at
some future time. At December 31, 2002, approximately $118 million of Dominion’s regulatory assets represented past expenditures on which it does not earn a return. These expenditures consist primarily of unrecovered gas costs, customer bad
debts and a portion of deferred fuel costs. Unrecovered gas and deferred fuel costs are recovered within two years; recovery of customer bad debts is expected to be addressed in the next base rate case.


.    Short-Term Debt and Credit Agreements

Joint Credit Facilities

In May 2002, Dominion, Virginia
Power and CNG entered into two joint credit facilities that allow aggregate borrowings of up to $2 billion. The facilities include a $1.25 billion 364-day revolving credit facility that terminates in May 2003 and a $750 million three-year revolving
credit facility that terminates in May 2005. The 364-day facility includes an option to extend any borrowings for an additional period of one year to May 2004. These joint credit facilities are being used for working capital, as support for the
combined commercial paper programs of Dominion, Virginia Power and CNG and other general corporate purposes. The three-year facility can also be used to support up to $200 million of letters of credit. Dominion expects to renew the 364-day revolving
credit facility prior to its maturity in May 2003.

At December 31, 2002, total outstanding commercial paper supported by the
joint credit facilities was $1.2 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.71 percent. At December 31, 2001, total outstanding commercial paper supported by previous credit agreements was $1.9 billion, with a weighted average interest rate
of 2.72 percent.

At December 31, 2002, total outstanding letters of credit supported by the three-year facility were
$106 million. There were no outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2001.

CNG Credit Facility

In August 2002, CNG entered into a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility that terminates in
August 2003. This credit facility is being used to support CNG’s issuance of commercial paper and letters of credit to provide collateral required by counterparties to derivative financial contracts used by CNG in its risk management strategies
for its gas and oil production. At December 31, 2002, outstanding letters of credit under this facility totaled $500 million.

Cove Point Bridge Facility

In September 2002, Dominion
financed its acquisition of Cove Point with commercial paper supported by a $250 million 364-day revolving credit facility. This bridge facility will expire in March 2003 and will not be renewed. See Note 5 for a discussion of the Cove Point
acquisition.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)


.    Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists of the following:

(1)

$250 million of the 7.82% remarketable notes due September 15, 2014 will be either mandatorily purchased and remarketed by the remarketing agent or mandatorily redeemed
by Dominion on September 15, 2004.

(2)

At the exercised option of holders, CNG will be required to purchase its $150 million, 6.875% senior notes due October 15, 2026 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
interest on October 15, 2006.

(3)

Substantially all of Virginia Power’s property is subject to the lien of the mortgage, securing its mortgage bonds. In 2002, Virginia Power redeemed its $200 million,
6.75% mortgage bonds due February 1, 2007. Virginia Power completed the redemption with part of the proceeds from the issuance of $650 million, 5.375% senior notes due February 1, 2007. The redemption included a direct exchange of senior notes for
$117 million of mortgage bonds. Virginia Power used the remaining proceeds of senior notes to redeem the remaining $83 million of mortgage bonds and for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt.

(4)

Certain pollution control equipment at Virginia Power’s generating facilities has been pledged to support these financings.

(5)

In 2002, Virginia Power converted $292 million of its variable rate tax exempt financings to fixed rates, ranging from 4.95% to 5.875%. Other terms of the bonds remain the
same.

(6)

Includes an aggregate principal amount of CAD$335 million of securities denominated in Canadian dollars and presented in US dollars, based on exchange rates as of year-end.

(7)

In 2002, Dominion redeemed $200 million of 7.40% remarketable senior notes and $250 million of variable rate remarketable senior notes, both due September 16, 2012. In a
direct exchange, Dominion completed the redemption by issuing $520 million, 5.70% senior notes due September 17, 2012. The principal amount of the senior notes was determined by an exchange ratio that was based on the fair value of the remarketable
senior notes. The $63 million difference between the principal amounts of senior notes issued and remarketable senior notes redeemed was recorded as a debt discount.

(8)

Represents weighted-average coupon rates for debt outstanding as of December 31, 2002.

The scheduled principal payments of long-term debt at December 31, 2002 were as follows (in millions):

In
December 2002, Dominion issued $600 million of senior notes, of which $500 million of proceeds was deposited into an escrow account solely for the purpose of being used to repay approximately one half of the aggregate principal amount of
Dominion’s 2001 Series A 6.0 percent senior notes maturing in January 2003.

Dominion’s short-term credit
facilities and long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions. As of December 2002, there were no events of default under these covenants.

Equity—Linked Securities

In 2002 and 2000, Dominion issued equity-linked debt securities, consisting of stock purchase contracts and senior notes. The stock purchase contracts obligate the holders to purchase shares of Dominion common stock from Dominion by
a settlement date, two years prior to the senior notes’ maturity date. The purchase price is $50 and the number of shares to be purchased will be determined under a formula based upon the average closing price of Dominion common stock near the
settlement date. The senior notes, or treasury securities in some instances, are pledged as collateral to secure the purchase of common stock under the related stock purchase contracts. The holders may satisfy their obligations under the stock
purchase contracts by allowing the senior notes to be remarketed with the proceeds being paid to Dominion as consideration for the purchase of stock. Alternatively, holders may choose to continue holding the senior notes and use other resources as
consideration for the purchase of stock under the stock purchase contracts.



Dominion makes quarterly interest payments on the senior notes and quarterly payments
on the stock purchase contracts at the rates described below. Dominion has recorded the present value of the stock purchase contract payments as a liability, offset by a charge to common stock in shareholders’ equity. Interest payments on the
senior notes are recorded as interest expense and stock purchase contract payments are charged against the liability. Accretion of the stock purchase contract liability is recorded as interest expense. In calculating diluted earnings per share,
Dominion applies the treasury stock method to the equity-linked debt securities. These securities did not have a significant effect on diluted earnings per share for 2002.

Under the terms of the stock purchase contracts, Dominion will issue between 6.7 million and 8.1 million shares of its common stock in November 2004 and between 4.1 million and 5.5 million shares
of its common stock in May 2006. A total of 13.6 million shares of Dominion common stock has been reserved for issuance in connection with the stock purchase contracts.

Selected information about Dominion’s equity-linked debt securities is presented below:

22.

Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts

From 1997 through 2002,
Dominion established five subsidiary capital trusts that sold trust preferred securities that represented preferred beneficial interests and 97 percent beneficial ownership in the assets held by the capital trusts. In exchange for the funds realized
from the sale of the trust preferred securities and common securities that represent the remaining 3 percent beneficial ownership interest in the assets held by the capital trust, Dominion issued various junior subordinated debt instruments. The
junior subordinated debt instruments constitute 100 percent of each capital trust’s assets. The trust must redeem the trust preferred securities when the junior subordinated notes are repaid at maturity or if redeemed prior to maturity. The
following table provides

summary information about the capital trusts and junior subordinated debt instruments outstanding as of
December 31, 2002:

Junior subordinated notes/debentures held as assets by each capital trust were as follows:

(1)

$258 million—Dominion Resources, Inc. 7.83% Debentures due 12/1/2027.

(2)

$309 million—Dominion Resources, Inc. 8.4% Debentures due 1/30/2041.

(3)

$258 million—Dominion Resources, Inc. 8.4% Debentures due 1/15/2031.

(4)

$206 million—CNG 7.8% Debentures due 10/31/2041.

(5)

$412 million—Virginia Power 7.375% Debentures due 7/30/2042.

In 2002, Virginia Power redeemed $139 million of junior subordinated debt instruments held by Virginia Power Capital Trust I. The
trust redeemed all outstanding trust preferred securities for $135 million and redeemed $4 million of its common securities held by Virginia Power.

Distribution payments on the trust preferred securities are guaranteed by the respective company that issued the debt instruments held by each trust, but only to the extent that the trusts have funds
legally and immediately available to make distributions. The trust’s ability to pay amounts when they are due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon the payment of amounts by Dominion, Virginia Power or CNG when they are due
on the junior subordinated debt instruments. If the payment on the junior subordinated notes is deferred, the company that issued them may not make distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases,
liquidation payments or guarantee payments. Also, during the deferral period, it may not make any payments or redeem or repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the junior subordinated debt
instruments.


.    Preferred Stock

Dominion is
authorized to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock. Dominion issued 665,000 shares of Series A mandatorily convertible preferred stock, liquidation preference



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

$1,000 per share, to Piedmont Share Trust (Piedmont Trust) in connection with the formation of DFV and the issuance of senior notes by DFV.
Dominion is the beneficial owner of the Piedmont Trust which is consolidated in the preparation of Dominion’s Consolidated Financial Statements, thus eliminating these outstanding shares of preferred stock. See Note 30.

Virginia Power is authorized to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, $100 liquidation preference. Upon involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Virginia Power, each share is entitled to receive $100 per share plus accrued dividends. Dividends are cumulative.

Holders of the outstanding preferred stock of Virginia Power are not entitled to voting rights except under certain provisions of the amended and restated articles of incorporation and related
provisions of Virginia law restricting corporate action, or upon default in dividends, or in special statutory proceedings and as required by Virginia law (such as mergers, consolidations, sales of assets, dissolution and changes in voting rights or
priorities of preferred stock).

In 2002, Virginia Power purchased and redeemed, at par, all shares of its variable rate
preferred stock October 1988 Series, June 1989 Series, September 1992A Series and September 1992B Series for $250 million, at the redemption price of $100 per share. The dividend rates for these series were variable and set every 49 days via an
auction process. The combined weighted average rates for all series outstanding during 2002, 2001 and 2000, including fees for broker/dealer agreements, were 4.00 percent, 4.32 percent and 5.71 percent, respectively.

In 2002, Virginia Power issued 1,250 units consisting of 1,000 shares per unit of cumulative preferred stock for $125 million. The
preferred stock has a dividend rate of 5.50 percent until the end of the initial dividend period on December 20, 2007. The dividend rate for subsequent periods will be determined according to periodic auctions. The preferred stock has a liquidation
preference of $100 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. Except during the initial dividend period, and any non-call period, the preferred stock will be redeemable, in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date at the option of
Virginia Power. Virginia Power may also redeem the preferred stock, in whole but not in part, if certain changes are made to federal tax law which reduce the dividends received percentage.

Presented below are the series of Virginia Power preferred stock not subject to mandatory redemption that were outstanding as of December
31, 2002.

(1)

Through 7/31/03; $103.53 commencing 8/1/03; amounts decline in steps thereafter to $100.00.

Through 8/31/03; $103.49 commencing 9/1/03; amounts decline in steps thereafter to $100.00.


.    Shareholders’ Equity

Issuance of Common Stock

During 2002, Dominion issued 44 million shares of common stock and received proceeds of $2.0 billion. This included the issuance of approximately 38
million shares and receipt of proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion through two public equity offerings. Net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, principally repayment of debt. The remainder of the shares issued and proceeds received
in 2002 occurred through Dominion Direct

®

(a dividend reinvestment and open enrollment direct stock purchase
plan), employee savings plans and the exercise of employee stock options.

Repurchases of Common Stock

Dominion is authorized by its Board of Directors to repurchase up to $650 million of Dominion
common stock outstanding. As of December 31, 2002, Dominion had repurchased approximately 12 million shares for $537 million. During 2002, Dominion repurchased 1 million shares for approximately $66 million, primarily using proceeds received
from the exercise of employee stock options.

Immediately before the CNG merger in January 2000, Dominion concluded a first
step transaction in which 33 million shares of Dominion common stock were exchanged for approximately $1.4 billion. Dominion also repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of stock in 2000 through a total return swap facility at a cost of
approximately $145 million. These transactions were independent of the general repurchase authority described above.

Shares Reserved for Issuance

At December 31, 2002, a
total of 59 million shares was reserved and available for issuance pursuant to Dominion Direct

®

, various
employee and director stock award and



savings plans, stock purchase contracts associated with equity-linked debt securities and Dominion’s Series A Mandatorily Convertible
Preferred Stock. See Notes 23 and 30 for a discussion of Dominion’s issuance of 665,000 shares of Series A Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock, liquidation preference $1,000 per share to Piedmont Share Trust.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

Presented in the table below is a summary of accumulated other comprehensive income by component:

Stock-Based Awards

The following table provides a summary of changes in amounts of Dominion stock options outstanding as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000. Generally, the exercise price of Dominion employee stock options equals the market price of Dominion common stock on the date of grant.

(1)

In connection with the acquisition of Louis Dreyfus, employee stock options of Louis Dreyfus were converted into employee stock options of Dominion. Based on the conversion
formula, certain converted stock options had exercise prices that either exceeded or were less than the market price of Dominion common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of all converted stock options was included in the purchase price of
Louis Dreyfus. See Note 5.

The
fair value of the options was estimated on the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the

following weighed-average assumptions for 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively: expected dividend yield of 4.17 percent, 4.22 percent and 5.22 percent; expected volatility of 22.67 percent, 22.19 percent and 21.54 percent; contractual life of 10 years (all periods); risk free interest rate of 4.38 percent,
5.15 percent and 5.18 percent; and expected lives of six years (all periods).

The following table provides certain information about stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2002:

During
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, Dominion granted approximately 14,000 shares, 341,000 shares and 171,000 shares of restricted stock with weighted-average fair values of $60.62, $63.49 and $41.88.


.    Dividend Restrictions

The 1935 Act and related
regulations issued by the SEC impose restrictions on the transfer and receipt of funds by a registered holding company from its subsidiaries, including a general prohibition against loans or advances being made by the subsidiaries to benefit the
registered holding company. Under the 1935 Act, registered holding companies and their subsidiaries may pay dividends only from retained earnings, unless the SEC specifically authorizes payments from other capital accounts. Dominion received
dividends from its subsidiaries of $945 million, $806 million and $1.3 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2002, Dominion’s consolidated subsidiaries had approximately $8.4 billion in capital accounts other than
retained earnings, representing capital stock, additional paid in capital and accumulated other comprehensive income. Dominion Resources, Inc. had approximately $8.7 billion in capital accounts other than retained earnings at December 31, 2002.
Generally, such amounts are not available for the payment of dividends by affected subsidiaries, or by Dominion itself, without specific authorization by the SEC. In response to a



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Dominion request, the SEC granted relief in 2000, authorizing payment of dividends by CNG from other capital accounts to Dominion in amounts
up to $1.6 billion, representing CNG’s retained earnings prior to Dominion’s acquisition of CNG. Furthermore, Dominion has submitted a similar request to the SEC in 2002, seeking relief from this restriction in regard to its subsidiary,
into which Louis Dreyfus was merged. The application requests relief up to approximately $303 million, representing Louis Dreyfus’ retained earnings prior to Dominion’s acquisition of Louis Dreyfus. Dominion’s ability to pay dividends
on its common stock at declared rates was not impacted by the restrictions discussed above during 2002, 2001 and 2000.

The
Virginia Commission may prohibit any public service company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a dividend to an affiliate, if found not to be in the public interest. At December 31, 2002, the Virginia Commission had not restricted
the payment of dividends by Virginia Power.

Certain agreements associated with Dominion’s credit facilities contain
restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion’s ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002.

See Note 22 for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion and certain subsidiaries in connection with the
deferral of distribution payments on trust preferred securities.


.    Employee Benefit Plans

Dominion and its subsidiaries provide certain benefits to eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. Under the terms of its benefit plans, Dominion and its subsidiaries reserve the
right to change, modify or terminate the plans. From time to time in the past, benefits have changed, and some of these changes have reduced benefits.

Dominion maintains qualified noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans covering virtually all employees. Retirement benefits are based primarily on years of service, age and compensation.
Dominion’s funding policy is to generally contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with the provisions of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The pension program also provides benefits to certain retired executives
under company-sponsored nonqualified employee benefit plans. Certain of these nonqualified plans are funded through contributions to a grantor trust.

Dominion provides retiree health care and life insurance benefits with annual premiums based on several factors such as age, retirement date and years of service.

In 2001, Dominion eliminated certain senior management positions. Dominion paid these individuals special termination benefits and
accelerated the payment of

benefits under Dominion’s nonqualified pension plans. Dominion recognized special termination benefits expense of $15 million, a loss of $7 million related
to the settlement of the related non-qualified pension obligation and a curtailment loss of $2 million.

In 2000, Dominion
offered an early retirement program (ERP). The ERP provided up to three additional years of age and three additional years of employee service for benefit formula purposes, subject to age and service maximums under Dominion and its
subsidiaries’ postretirement medical and pension plans. Certain employees who satisfied certain minimum age and years of service requirements were eligible under the ERP. The effect of the ERP on Dominion’s pension and postretirement
benefit expenses was $81 million and $33 million, respectively. These expenses were offset, in part, by curtailment gains of approximately $20 million and $6 million from pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively,
attributable to reductions in expected future years of service as a result of ERP participation and involuntary employee terminations.

In addition, effective January 1, 2000, Dominion adopted a change in the method of calculating the market-related value of pension plan assets. The change was reported as a change in accounting principle. See Note 3.



The following tables summarize the changes in Dominion’s pension and other
postretirement benefit plan obligations and plan assets and a statement of the plans’ funded status:

Dominion
has nonqualified pension and supplemental pension plans which do not have “plan assets” as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. The total projected benefit obligation for these plans was $97 million and $103 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is included in the table above. The total accumulated benefit obligation for these plans was $88 million and $94 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The additional minimum liability
recognized relating to these plans was $34 million and $33 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The components of the provision for net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

Significant assumptions used in determining net periodic cost, the projected benefit obligation and postretirement benefit obligations were:

(1)

Dominion has adopted 8.75 percent for pension benefits in 2003.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point
change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Other Postretirement Benefits



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In addition, Dominion sponsors defined contribution  thrift-type savings plans.
During 2002, 2001 and 2000, Dominion recognized $26 million, $27 million and $30 million, respectively, as contributions to these plans.

Certain regulatory authorities have held that amounts recovered in utility customers’ rates for other postretirement benefits, in excess of benefits actually paid during the year, must be deposited in trust funds dedicated for
the sole purpose of paying such benefits. Accordingly, certain subsidiaries fund postretirement benefit costs through Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Associations. The remaining subsidiaries do not prefund postretirement benefit costs but
instead pay claims as presented.


.    Commitments and Contingencies

As the result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, Dominion and its subsidiaries are involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions
and governmental agencies, some of which involve substantial amounts of money. Management believes that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Cash Requirements for Planned Capital Expenditures

Dominion has made substantial commitments in connection with its capital expenditures program. Cash requirements for those expenditures are estimated to
total approximately $2.4 billion, $2.2 billion and $2.1 for 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. Purchases of nuclear fuel are included in

Fuel Purchase Commitments

below. Dominion expects that these expenditures will be met through a
combination of sales of securities and short-term borrowings to the extent not funded by cash flows from operations.

Power Purchase Contracts

Dominion has entered into
contracts for long-term purchases of capacity and energy from other utilities, qualifying facilities and independent power producers. As of December 31, 2002, Dominion had 42 non-utility purchase contracts with a combined dependable summer capacity
of 3,758 megawatts. The table below reflects Dominion’s minimum commitments as of December 31, 2002 under these contracts.

Capacity and other purchases under these contracts totaled $691 million, $680 million and $740 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

In 2001, Dominion completed the
purchase of three generating facilities and the termination of seven long-term power purchase contracts with non-utility generators. Dominion recorded an after-tax charge of $136 million in connection with the purchase and termination of long-term
power purchase contracts. Cash payments related to the purchase of three generating facilities totaled $207 million. The allocation of the purchase price was assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon estimated fair values as of the
date of acquisition. Substantially all of the value was attributed to the power purchase contracts which were terminated and resulted in a charge included in operation and maintenance expense.

Fuel Purchase Commitments

Dominion enters into long-term purchase commitments for fuel used in electric generation and natural gas for purposes other than trading. Estimated payments under these commitments for the next five
years are as follows: 2003—$599 million; 2004—$311 million; 2005—$253 million; 2006—$205 million; 2007—$89 million; and years beyond 2007—$215 million. These purchase commitments include those required for regulated
operations. Dominion recovers the costs of those purchases through regulated rates. The natural gas purchase commitments of Dominion’s field services operations are also included, net of related sales commitments. In addition, Dominion has
committed to purchase certain volumes of natural gas at market index prices determined in the period the natural gas is delivered. These transactions have been designated as normal purchases and sales under SFAS No. 133.

Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage Capacity Commitments

Dominion enters into long-term commitments for the purchase of natural gas pipeline and storage capacity for purposes other than trading. Estimated
payments under these commitments for the next five years are as follows: 2003—$34 million; 2004—$23 million; 2005—$13 million. There were no significant commitments beyond 2005.

Production Handling and Firm Transportation Commitments

In connection with its gas and oil production operations, Dominion has entered into certain transportation and production handling agreements with minimum
commitments expected to be paid in the following years: 2003—$23 million; 2004—$57 million; 2005—$56 million; 2006—$53 million; 2007—$44 million; and years after 2007—$68 million.



Lease Commitments

Dominion leases various facilities, vehicles, aircraft and equipment under both operating and capital leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating and capital leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of
one year as of December 31, 2002 are as follows: 2003—$94 million; 2004—$94 million; 2005—$82 million; 2006—$67 million; 2007—$62 million; and years beyond 2007—$79 million. Rental expense included in other operations
and maintenance expense was $84 million, $75 million and $107 million for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

As of December
31, 2002, Dominion, through certain subsidiaries, has entered into agreements with special purpose entities (lessors) in order to finance and lease several new power generation projects, as well as its corporate headquarters and aircraft. The
lessors have an aggregate financing commitment from equity and debt investors of $2.2 billion, of which $1.6 billion has been used for total project costs to date. Dominion, in its role as construction agent for the lessors, is responsible for
completing construction by a specified date. In the event a project is terminated before completion, Dominion has the option to either purchase the project for 100 percent of project costs or terminate the project and make a payment to the lessor of
approximately but no more than 89.9 percent of project costs. Upon completion of each individual project, Dominion has use of the project assets subject to an operating lease. Dominion’s lease payments to the lessors are sufficient to provide a
return to the investors. At the end of each individual project’s lease term, Dominion may renew the lease at negotiated amounts based on project costs and current market conditions, subject to investors’ approval; purchase the project at
its original construction cost; or sell the project, on behalf of the lessor, to an independent third party. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors, Dominion may be required to make a payment to
the lessor up to an amount ranging from 81 percent to 85 percent of the project cost depending on the individual project and applicable agreement. Dominion has guaranteed a portion of the obligations of its subsidiaries to the lessors during the
construction and post-construction periods. Neither the guarantees nor the underlying transaction documents contain any type of credit rating or stock price trigger events. Total project costs at December 31, 2002 included approximately $288 million
of costs advanced by Dominion that will be reimbursed by the lessor during the second quarter of 2003.

The projects are
accounted for as operating leases for financial accounting purposes. Accordingly, neither the project assets nor related obligations are reported on Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In February 2003, pursuant to the terms of its lease agreement, Dominion purchased the electric generation

facility under construction in Dresden, Ohio for $266 million. This amount was included in total project costs of $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2002. Dominion expects to complete construction in 2005
at an estimated cost of $350 million.

The future minimum lease payments described above include annual minimum lease
payments under these leases for assets currently in use total approximately $38 million. Projects being developed under leasing arrangements are scheduled for completion in 2003 and 2004. Annual lease payments for these projects are estimated to be
$7 million for 2003 and $79 million by 2005. See Note 4.

Energy Trading

Subsidiaries of Dominion enter into purchases and sales of commodity-based contracts in the energy-related markets, including natural gas,
electricity and oil. These agreements may cover current and future periods. The volume of these transactions varies from day to day, based on market conditions. See Note 15 for a discussion of Dominion’s energy trading activities and risk
management policies.

Environmental Matters

Dominion is subject to costs resulting from a steadily increasing number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health
and the environment. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.

Historically, Dominion recovered such costs arising from regulated electric operations through utility rates. However, to the extent
environmental costs are incurred in connection with operations regulated by the Virginia State Corporation Commission during the period ending June 30, 2007, in excess of the level currently included in Virginia jurisdictional rates, Dominion’s
results of operations will decrease. After that date, Dominion may seek recovery through rates of only those environmental costs related to transmission and distribution operations.

Superfund Sites—

In 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified Dominion and a number of other
entities as Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at two Superfund sites located in Kentucky and Pennsylvania.

Current cost studies estimate total remediation costs for the sites to range from $98 million to $152 million. Dominion’s

proportionate share of the total cost is expected to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million, based on allocation formulas and the volume of waste shipped to the sites. The majority of remediation activities at the Kentucky site are complete
and

remediation design is ongoing for the Pennsylvania site. Dominion has accrued a reserve of $2 million to meet its obligations at these two sites. Although each PRP can be held



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

jointly, severally and strictly liable for all costs, Dominion has determined that it is probable that the PRPs will fully pay their share of
the costs based on a financial assessment of the PRPs involved at these sites. Dominion generally seeks to recover its costs associated with environmental remediation from third party insurers. At December 31, 2002, any pending or possible claims
were not recognized as an asset or offset against such obligations.

Other EPA Matters

—

During 2000,
Virginia Power received a Notice of Violation from the EPA, alleging that Virginia Power failed to obtain New Source Review permits under the Clean Air Act prior to undertaking specified construction projects at the Mt. Storm Power Station in
West Virginia. The Attorney General of New York filed a suit against Virginia Power alleging similar violations of the Clean Air Act at the Mt. Storm Power Station. Virginia Power also received notices from the Attorneys General of Connecticut and
New Jersey of their intentions to file suit for similar violations. In December 2002, the Attorney General of Connecticut filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in the action filed by the New York State Attorney General. This action has been
stayed. Management believes that Virginia Power has obtained the necessary permits for its generating facilities. Virginia Power has reached an agreement in principle with the federal government and the state of New York to resolve this situation.
The agreement in principle includes payment of a $5 million civil penalty, a commitment of $14 million for environmental projects in Virginia, West Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York and a 12-year, $1.2 billion capital investment program
for environmental improvements at the Company’s coal-fired generating stations in Virginia and West Virginia. Virginia Power had already committed to a substantial portion of the $1.2 billion expenditures for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions controls. The negotiations over the terms of a binding settlement have expanded beyond the basic agreement in principle and are ongoing. As of December 31, 2002, Virginia Power has recorded, on a discounted basis, $18 million for the civil
penalty and environmental projects.

In 2002, EPA issued a Section 114 request for information about whether projects
undertaken at Virginia Power’s Chesterfield, Chesapeake, Yorktown, Possum Point and Bremo Bluff power stations were properly permitted under the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review requirements, to which Virginia Power responded in a timely
manner.

In 2002, the EPA issued a Section 114 request for information about whether Morgantown Energy Associates’ (MEA)
facility in Morgantown, West Virginia is in compliance with environmental requirements. EPA made a site visit and at that time received the requested information. In September 2002, MEA received a copy of EPA’s inspection

report summarizing the facts surrounding the visit. MEA is prepared to resolve follow-up questions from EPA. MEA is a 50 percent-owned investment accounted for by Dominion under the equity method.

Other—

Before being acquired by Dominion, Louis Dreyfus was one of numerous defendants in several lawsuits
pending in the Texas 93rd Judicial District Court in Hildago County, Texas. The lawsuit alleges that gas wells and related pipeline facilities operated by Louis Dreyfus and facilities operated by other defendants caused an underground hydrocarbon
plume in McAllen, Texas. The plaintiffs claim that they have suffered damages, including property damage and lost profits, as a result of the plume. Although the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable, Dominion does not expect the
ultimate outcome of the case to have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Spent Nuclear Fuel

Under provisions of the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act of 1982, Dominion has entered into contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin accepting the spent nuclear fuel on January 31, 1998, the date provided by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and by
Dominion’s contract with the DOE. Dominion will continue to safely manage its spent fuel until accepted by the DOE.

Retrospective Premium Assessments

Under several of
Dominion’s nuclear insurance policies, Dominion is subject to retrospective premium assessments in any policy year in which losses exceed the funds available to these insurance companies. For additional information, see Note 16.

Guarantees, Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds

As discussed in Note 4, FIN No. 45 requires disclosures related to the issuance of certain types of guarantees, beginning with financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2002. For purposes of consolidated financial statements, guarantees issued by a parent on behalf of its consolidated subsidiary, guarantees issued by a consolidated subsidiary on behalf of its parent or guarantees issued
by a consolidated subsidiary on behalf of a sister consolidated subsidiary are not subject to the FIN No. 45’s disclosure requirements.

Nevertheless, Dominion is providing the following information about the guarantees that it and certain of its subsidiaries may issue in the ordinary course of business to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on
behalf of certain subsidiaries. These agreements include guarantees, stand-by letters of credit and surety bonds. The amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular



point in time. Guarantees and stand-by letters of credit are used, when necessary, to support or enhance a subsidiary’s stand-alone
creditworthiness. Accordingly, Dominion and certain subsidiaries have entered into guarantees and stand-by letters of credit so that third parties would be willing to enter into contracts with the subsidiaries and to extend sufficient credit to
facilitate the subsidiaries’ accomplishment of intended commercial purposes. In such instances, guarantees may be used to limit exposures resulting from subsidiary business activities to pre-defined amounts. While the majority of these
guarantees do not have a termination date, Dominion may choose at any time to limit the applicability of such guarantees to future transactions.

To the extent a liability subject to a guarantee has been incurred by a consolidated subsidiary, that liability is included in Dominion’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion believes it unlikely that it would be
required to perform or otherwise incur any losses associated with guarantees of its subsidiaries’ obligations. On behalf of consolidated subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2002, Dominion and its subsidiaries had issued $5.2 billion of guarantees;
purchased $117 million of surety bonds; and authorized the issuance of standby letters of credit by financial institutions of $606 million.

Only in those limited instances where Dominion or certain subsidiaries enter into a guarantee on behalf of a party that is not consolidated in the preparation of Dominion’s Consolidated Financial Statements would
performance under the agreement result in the recognition of additional liabilities in Dominion’s Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2002, Dominion has guaranteed $70 million related to officers’ borrowings under
executive stock loan programs, for which individual officers are personally liable for repayment. Substantially all of this guarantee is scheduled to expire in 2005.

Dominion has also guaranteed $32 million for obligations of certain equity method investments - Dominion Telecom, Inc., MEA and Elwood Energy.

Indemnifications

In addition, as part of commercial contract negotiations in the normal course of business, Dominion may sometimes agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may involve an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretation of the tax law. Dominion is
unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts because events that would obligate Dominion have not yet occurred or, if any such event has occurred, Dominion

has not been notified of its occurrence. However, at December 31, 2002, management believes future payments, if any, that could ultimately become payable under these contract provisions, would not have a material impact
on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Stranded
Costs

Under the Virginia Restructuring Act, the generation portion of Dominion’s Virginia jurisdictional operations is no longer
subject to cost-based regulation, effective January 1, 2002. Dominion’s base rates (excluding fuel costs and certain other allowable adjustments) will remain capped until July 2007, unless terminated sooner or otherwise modified consistent with
the Virginia Restructuring Act. Under the Act, Dominion may request a termination of the capped rates at any time after January 1, 2004, and the Virginia State Corporation Commission may grant Dominion’s request to terminate the capped rates,
if it finds that a competitive generation services market exists in Dominion’s service area. Dominion believes capped electric retail rates and, where applicable, wires charges provided under the Virginia Restructuring Act provide an
opportunity to recover a portion of its potentially stranded costs, depending on market prices of electricity and other factors. Stranded costs are those costs incurred or commitments made by utilities under cost-based regulation that may not be
reasonably expected to be recovered in a competitive market.

Even in the capped rate environment, Dominion remains exposed
to numerous risks, including, among others, exposure to potentially stranded costs, future environmental compliance requirements, changes in tax laws, inflation and increased capital costs. At December 31, 2002, Dominion’s exposure to
potentially stranded costs included: long-term power purchase contracts that could ultimately be determined to be above market (see

Power Purchase Contracts

above); generating plants that could possibly become uneconomic in a deregulated
environment; and unfunded obligations for nuclear plant decommissioning and postretirement benefits not yet recognized in the financial statements. See Notes 16 and 26.


.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Substantially all of Dominion’s financial instruments are
recorded at fair value, with the exception of the instruments described below. Fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies considered appropriate by management. Dominion reports the
following financial instruments based on historical cost rather than fair value.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The financial instruments’ carrying amounts and fair values as of December 31,
2002 and 2001 were as follows:

(1)

Fair value is estimated using market prices, where available; otherwise, interest rates, currently available for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities,
are used. The carrying amount of debt issues with short-term maturities and variable rates repriced at current market rates is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

(2)

Fair value is based on market quotations.

(3)

The 2002 carrying value of $1,397 million represents principal outstanding of $1,400 million, less an unamortized discount of $3 million, and the 2001 carrying value of $1,132
million represents principal outstanding of $1,135 million, less an unamortized discount of $3 million.


.    Concentration of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to Dominion if
counterparties fail to perform their contractual obligations. Dominion engages in transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services with major companies in the energy industry and with commercial and residential energy consumers. These
transactions principally occur in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Management does not believe that this geographic concentration contributes significantly to Dominion’s overall exposure to credit risk.
Credit risk associated with trade accounts receivable from energy consumers is limited due to the large number of customers.

Dominion maintains credit policies with respect to its counterparties that management believes minimize overall credit risk. Where appropriate, such policies include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty’s financial
condition, collateral requirements and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. Dominion also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis.
Dominion maintains a provision for credit losses based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of its customers, historical trends and other information. Management believes, based on Dominion’s credit policies and its December 31, 2002
provision for credit losses, that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

Dominion calculates its gross credit exposure for each counterparty as the unrealized fair value of derivative and

energy trading contracts plus any outstanding receivables (net of payables, where netting agreements exist), prior to the application of collateral. In the calculation of net credit exposure,
Dominion’s gross exposure is reduced by collateral made available by counterparties, including letters of credit and cash received by Dominion and held as margin deposits. Presented below is a summary of Dominion’s gross and net credit
exposure as of December 31, 2002. The amounts presented exclude accounts receivable for retail electric and gas sales and services, regulated transmission services and Dominion’s provision for credit losses.

(1)

This category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of Baa3 assigned by Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) and BBB- assigned by Standard &
Poor’s Rating Group, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Standard & Poor’s). The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 13 percent of the total gross credit exposure.

(2)

This category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment grade. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented
approximately 6 percent of the total gross credit exposure.

(3)

This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, but are considered investment grade based on Dominion’s
evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 18 percent of the total gross credit exposure.

(4)

This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, and are considered non-investment grade based on
Dominion’s evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 3 percent of the total gross credit exposure.


.    Dominion Fiber Ventures, LLC

Dominion has a 50
percent voting interest in DFV, a joint venture with a third-party investor trust (Investor Trust). DFV was established to fund the development of its principal investment, Dominion Telecom, Inc. (DTI), a telecommunications business. DTI is a
facilities-based interchange and emerging local carrier that provides broadband solutions to wholesale customers throughout the eastern United States. Due to the veto rights and substantive equity at risk from the Investor Trust, Dominion’s
investment in DFV is accounted for using the equity method. See Note 31.



In connection with its formation, DFV issued $665 million of 7.05 percent senior
secured notes due March 2005 (DFV Senior Notes).

The DFV Senior Notes were secured in part by Dominion convertible preferred
stock held in trust. Dominion was the beneficial owner of the trust and included it in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to Dominion’s repurchase of substantially all of the outstanding DFV Senior Notes in February
2003, as described below, the preferred stock would have been subject to being remarketed in an amount sufficient to retire the DFV Senior Notes at maturity or earlier if the credit ratings for Dominion Resources, Inc. senior unsecured debt were
BBB– or Baa3 during a period when the closing price of Dominion’s common stock was below $45.97 for ten consecutive trading days. If the remarketing of the preferred stock occurred, the convertible preferred stock would have been
considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of Dominion’s common stock or could have resulted in the issuance of additional shares of Dominion common stock, if converted.

At the end of 2002 and 2001, DTI and DFV had loaned Dominion a total of $140 million and $367 million, respectively, which are reported as
notes payable—affiliates and securities due within one year on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2002 and 2001, Dominion incurred $13 million and $23 million of interest expense on the loans, respectively. For management and other support
services, Dominion billed DTI $35 million and $20 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Subsequent Event

On January 23, 2003, Dominion and DFV made a tender and consent offering for the DFV Senior Notes. Under
the terms of the offering, DFV sought the consent of the note holders to remove the stock price and credit downgrade trigger described above as well as certain other related modifications to the indenture. Dominion offered to purchase for cash all
of the outstanding notes. The consent and tender offer was successful, resulting in the removal of the stock price and credit downgrade trigger and the purchase of $633 million of the outstanding notes by Dominion in February 2003. Dominion paid a
total of $664 million for the notes acquired, using proceeds from the sale of $700 million of senior notes.

In connection
with this transaction, Dominion and Investor Trust agreed to certain amendments to the DFV limited liability company agreement. Pursuant to one of these amendments, Dominion agreed that upon the earlier of the scheduled maturity date of the DFV
Senior Notes or upon certain default events, Dominion will contribute the $644 million of DFV Senior Notes it holds to DFV in exchange for an additional equity interest in DFV.

As a result of this transaction, Dominion will consolidate the results of DFV in its financial statements
beginning in February 2003. The DFV Senior Notes held by Dominion will be eliminated in consolidation. After the transaction, $21 million of the DFV Senior Notes remain outstanding in the hands of third parties. Dominion will recognize a pre-tax
charge of approximately $60 million on the effective extinguishment of the acquired notes in the first quarter of 2003. The charge will primarily consist of the premium paid to acquire the notes, the consent fee paid to the note holders and the
write-off of unamortized debt costs related to the original issuance of the DFV Senior Notes. Furthermore, since Dominion holds substantially all of the DFV Senior Notes, it is unlikely that the remarketing of the Dominion convertible preferred
stock held in trust, discussed above, would ever occur.


.   Equity Method Investments and Affiliated Transactions

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Dominion’s equity method investments totaled $503 million and $523 million, respectively, and equity earnings on these investments totaled $11 million in 2002,
$36 million in 2001 and $47 million in 2000. Dominion’s equity method investments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other investments. In addition, Dominion has equity method investments that are held for sale, representing
primarily its interest in certain Australian natural gas pipelines. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, equity method investments that are held for sale totaled $83 million and $68 million, respectively, and are included in other current assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other than transactions involving its telecommunications joint venture described in Note 30, transactions between Dominion and its affiliates, as well as amounts due from those affiliates, were not significant.


.    Operating Segments

Dominion manages its
operations along three primary business lines:

Dominion Energy

manages
Dominion’s generation portfolio, consisting primarily of generating units and power purchase agreements. It also manages Dominion’s energy trading and marketing, hedging and arbitrage activities; and gas pipeline and certain gas production
and storage operations.

Dominion Delivery

manages Dominion’s electric and gas distribution systems, as well as
customer service and electric transmission. Dominion Delivery also includes Dominion’s investment in DFV, see Note 30.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Dominion Exploration & Production

manages Dominion’s onshore and
offshore gas and oil exploration, development and production operations. Operations are located in several major producing basins in the lower 48 states, including the outer continental shelf and deep-water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and Western
Canada.

Effective January 1, 2003, Dominion’s electric transmission operations will be managed by the Dominion Energy
operating segment.

In addition, Dominion also reports the operations of DCI and Dominion’s corporate and other
operations as a segment. Amounts included in the Corporate and Other category include:

n

corporate
expenses of the Dominion and CNG holding companies (including interest not allocated to other segments);

n

the operations of Corby (UK), prior to its sale on September 29, 2000 (see Note 6);

n

2002 and 2001 restructuring costs and 2000 restructuring and acquisition-related costs (see Note
8);

n

2001 costs associated with termination of long-term power purchase
contracts (see Note 27);

n

2001 provision for credit exposure in connection with Enron
bankruptcy (see Note 15);

n

2002, 2001 and 2000 impairment and re-valuation of certain DCI
investments (see Note 9);

n

2000 cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see
Note 3).

Dominion’s management evaluates
performance based on a measure of profit and loss that represents each segment’s contribution to Dominion’s net income. Intersegment sales and transfers are based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements and may result in
intersegment profit or loss.



The following table presents segment information pertaining to Dominion’s
operations:

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, approximately 3 and 2 percent of Dominion’s total long-lived assets, respectively, were associated
with international operations. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, approximately 1 and 2 percent of operating revenues were associated with international operations.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)


.    Gas and Oil Producing Activities  (unaudited)

Capitalized Costs

The aggregate amounts of costs
capitalized for gas and oil producing activities, and related aggregate amounts of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, at December 31, 2002 and 2001 follow:

Total Costs Incurred

The following costs were incurred in gas and oil producing activities during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000:

(1)

Development costs incurred for proved undeveloped reserves were $223 million and $133 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Results of Operations

Dominion cautions that the following standardized disclosures required by the FASB do not represent the results of operations based on its historical financial statements. In addition to requiring
different determinations of revenue and costs, the disclosures exclude the impact of interest expense and corporate overhead.



Company-Owned Reserves

Estimated net quantities of proved gas and oil (including condensate) reserves in the United States and Canada at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, and
changes in the reserves during those years, are shown in the two schedules which follow.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein

The following tabulation has been prepared in accordance with the FASB’s rules for disclosure of a standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows relating to proved gas and oil reserve quantities owned by Dominion.

(1)

Estimated future development costs, excluding abandonment, for proven undeveloped reserves are estimated to be $236 million, $239 million and $203 million for 2003, 2004 and
2005, respectively.

(2)

Amounts exclude the effect of derivative instruments designated as hedges of future sales of production at year end.

In the foregoing determination of future cash inflows, sales prices for gas and oil were based on contractual arrangements or market prices at year-end. Future costs of developing and producing the proved gas and oil reserves
reported at the end of each year shown were based on costs determined at each such year end, assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions. Future income taxes were computed by applying the appropriate year-end or future statutory tax
rate to future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of the properties involved, and giving effect to tax deductions, permanent differences and tax credits.

It is not intended that the
FASB’s standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows represent the fair market value of Dominion’s proved reserves. Dominion cautions that the disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserve quantities and future
production schedules which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision, and the 10 percent discount rate is arbitrary. In addition, costs and prices as of the measurement date are used in the determinations, and no value may be assigned to
probable or possible reserves.

The following tabulation is a summary of changes between the total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the
beginning and end of each year.




.    Quarterly Financial and Common Stock Data (unaudited)

A summary of the quarterly results
of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 follows. Amounts reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring accruals, necessary in the opinion of management for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
Results for interim periods may fluctuate as a result of weather conditions, changes in rates and other factors. Amounts for 2001 reflect certain reclassifications to conform to the 2002 presentation.

To the Shareholders’ and Board of Directors of

Dominion Resources, Inc.

Richmond, Virginia

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Dominion Resources,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, and have issued our report thereon dated January 21, 2003 (February 19, 2003 as to the last two paragraphs of the Lease

other intangible assets in 2002, derivative instruments and hedging activities in 2001, and the method of accounting used to develop the market-related value of pension plan assets in 2000; such consolidated financial statements and report are
included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedules of the Company, listed in Item 15. These consolidated financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s

Basis of Presentation

Pursuant to rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the unconsolidated condensed financial statements of Dominion Resources, Inc. (the Company) do not reflect all of the information and notes normally included with financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the 2002 Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8.

Accounting for subsidiaries

—The Company has accounted for the earnings of its subsidiaries under the equity method in the
unconsolidated condensed financial statements.

Income Taxes

—The unconsolidated income tax benefit computed for
the Company in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, reflects the tax assets and liabilities of the Company on a stand alone basis and the effect of filing a consolidated U.S. tax
return with its subsidiaries.

Long-Term Debt

(1)

Represents weighted-average coupon rates for debt outstanding as of December 31, 2002.

(2)

Includes $250 million of the 7.82 percent Series E Remarketable Notes due September 15, 2014, which will be either mandatorily purchased

and remarketed by the remarketing agent or mandatorily redeemed by the Company on September 15, 2004.

(3)

See Note 3.

(4)

Represents changes in fair value of certain fixed rate long-term debt associated with fair value hedging relationships.

(5)

In 2002, the Company redeemed two series of its remarketable senior notes due September 16, 2012: $200 million, 7.40 percent Series D and $250 million, Variable Rate Series F
(Remarketable Senior Notes). In a direct exchange, the Company completed the redemption by issuing $520 million, 5.70 percent Series C Senior Notes due September 17, 2012 (Senior Notes). The principal amount of the Senior Notes was determined by an
exchange ratio that was based upon the fair value of the Remarketable Senior Notes. The $63 million difference between the principal amounts of Senior Notes issued and Remarketable Senior Notes redeemed was recorded as an increase in debt discount.
In addition, through September 2004, the interest rate for the Senior Notes may increase if the credit ratings established by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s for Dominion Resources, Inc. senior unsecured debt securities decline. The total
increase is limited to 1 percent and would continue for any period in which the downgrade is in effect.

The scheduled principal payments of long-term debt at December 31, 2002 were as follows (in millions):

In
December 2002, the Company issued $600 million of senior notes, of which $500 million of proceeds was deposited into an escrow account solely for the purpose of being used to repay approximately one half of the aggregate principal amount of the
Company’s 2001 Series A 6.0 percent senior notes maturing in January 2003.

The Company’s long-term debt agreements
contain customary covenants and default provisions. As of December 31, 2002, there were no events of default under those covenants.

Note 3.

Equity-Linked Securities

In 2002 and 2000, the Company issued equity-linked debt securities,
consisting of stock purchase contracts and senior notes. The stock purchase contracts obligate the holders to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock from the Company by a settlement date, two years prior to the senior notes’
maturity date. The purchase price is $50 and the number of shares to be purchased will be determined under a formula based on the average closing price of the Company’s common stock near the settlement date. The senior notes, or treasury
securities in some instances, are pledged as collateral to secure the purchase of common stock under the related stock purchase contracts. The holders may satisfy their obligations under the stock purchase contracts by allowing the senior notes to
be remarketed with the proceeds being paid to



Dominion Resources, Inc. (Parent Company)

Schedule I—Condensed Financial Information of Registrant

Notes to Condensed Financial Statements

the Company as consideration for the purchase of stock. Alternatively, holders may choose to continue holding the senior notes and use other
resources as consideration for the purchase of stock under the stock purchase contracts.

The Company makes quarterly
interest payments on the senior notes and quarterly payments on the stock purchase contracts at the rates described below. The Company has recorded the present value of the stock purchase contract payments as a liability, offset by a charge to
common stock in shareholders’ equity. Interest payments on the senior notes are recorded as interest expense and stock purchase contract payments are charged against the liability. Accretion of the stock purchase contract liability is recorded
as interest expense.

Under the terms of the stock purchase contracts, the Company will issue between 6.7 million and 8.1
million shares of its common stock in November 2004 and between 4.1 million and 5.5 million shares of its common stock in May 2006. A total of 13.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock has been reserved for issuance in connection with
the stock purchase contracts.

Selected information about the Company’s equity-linked debt securities is presented below
(amounts other than percentages are in millions):

Note  4.

Guarantees, Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is party to various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of
certain subsidiaries. These agreements include guarantees, standby letters of credit and surety bonds. The amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular point in time.
Guarantees and stand-by letters of credit are used, when necessary, to support or enhance a subsidiary’s stand-alone creditworthiness. Accordingly, the Company entered into guarantees and stand-by letters of credit so that third parties would
be willing to enter into contracts with the subsidiaries and to extend sufficient credit to facilitate the subsidiaries’ accomplishment of intended commercial purposes. In such instances,

guarantees may be used to limit exposures resulting from subsidiary business activities to pre-defined amounts. While the majority of these guarantees do not have a termination date, the Company may choose at any time to limit the
applicability of such guarantees to future transactions.

Guarantees

The Company believes it unlikely that it would be required to perform or otherwise incur any losses associated with guarantees of its
subsidiaries’ obligations. As of December 31, 2002, outstanding guarantees include $4.0 billion issued by the Company and represented the following types of guarantees:

Guarantee of Subsidiary Debt

—The Company has guaranteed the payment of interest and principal of $541 million of subsidiary
debt, primarily for certain subsidiaries of Dominion Energy (DEI) and Dominion Capital, Inc. (DCI). In the event of default by the subsidiaries, the Company would be obligated to repay such amounts.

Guarantees Supporting Commodity Transactions of Subsidiaries

—The Company has also guaranteed contract payments up to
approximately $1.1 billion, primarily for certain subsidiaries of Virginia Electric and Power Company (Virginia Power), Consolidated Natural Gas (CNG) and DEI involved in energy marketing activities and $88 million related to other commodity
commitments. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related commodities and services. If any one of these
subsidiaries fails to perform or pay under the contracts and the counterparties seek performance or payment, the Company would be obligated to satisfy such obligation. The Company and its subsidiaries receive similar guarantees as collateral for
credit extended to others.

Guarantees Supporting Other Agreements

—The Company has also guaranteed the following
transactions:

n

$26 million related to the future
nuclear decommissioning obligations of certain DEI subsidiaries for the Millstone Power Station (Millstone) and $264 million related to potential retrospective premiums that could be assessed, if there is a nuclear incident under the Company’s
nuclear insurance programs for the Millstone Power Station. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2002 Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8 for more information on nuclear operations. Also, as part of satisfying certain Nuclear
Regulatory Commission requirements concerned with ensuring adequate funding for



Dominion Resources, Inc. (Parent Company)

Schedule I—Condensed Financial Information of Registrant

Notes to Condensed Financial
Statements—(continued)

Millstone’s operations, the Company has also agreed to provide up to $150 million to a DEI subsidiary, if requested by such subsidiary,
to pay Millstone operating expenses.

n

$91 million related to certain leases (fleet vehicles and computer hardware and software),
primarily for Dominion Resources Services, Inc. (DRS) and CNG. For information on commitments for the Company’s leases, see

Lease Commitments

in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2002 Form 10-K, Part II,
Item 8.

n

$1.6 billion related to the leasing obligations of certain subsidiaries of DEI for several new power
generation projects, as well as those of DRS for corporate headquarters and aircraft. See

Lease Commitments

in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2002 Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8.

n

$35 million related to the obligations of a DEI subsidiary under a cross-currency swap agreement. If the subsidiary were to default
on any amounts payable under the swap agreement, the Company would be obligated to pay such amounts.

n

$22 million
related to guarantees for letters of credit issued primarily on behalf of certain subsidiaries of DCI, CNG and DEI.

n

Guarantees
Supporting Related Parties—As of December 31, 2002, the Company has guaranteed $70 million related to officers’ borrowings under executive stock loan programs, for which individual officers are personally liable for repayment.
Substantially all of this guarantee is scheduled to expire in 2005. The Company has also guaranteed $32 million for certain obligations of certain equity method investments—Dominion Telecom, Inc., Morgantown Energy Associates and Elwood Energy.

Standby Letters of Credit

At December 31, 2002, the Company had authorized the issuance of standby letters of credit by financial institutions in the amounts of $71 million for the
benefit of certain counterparties that had extended credit to DEI. In the unlikely event that DEI does not pay amounts when due under the covered contracts, any covered counterparty may present its claim for payment to the financial institution,
which would then request payment from DEI and the Company, as applicable. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2002 Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8. As of December 31, 2002, no amounts had been presented for payment under
these letters of credit.

Surety Bonds

At December 31, 2002, the Company and its subsidiaries had purchased $63 million of surety bonds, $60 million of which

was purchased for subsidiaries. CNG, Virginia Power and various other Company subsidiaries have purchased $40 million, $9 million and $11 million, respectively, of surety bonds primarily in relation to providing worker
compensation benefits and obtaining licenses, permits and rights-of-way. Under the terms of the surety bonds, Virginia Power, DEI, or CNG and then the Company, are obligated to indemnify the respective surety bond company for any amounts paid on
behalf of subsidiaries. The Company has also indemnified $3 million of surety bonds issued for Dominion Telecom, Inc. For additional related party information, see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2002 Form 10-K, Part
II, Item 8.

Indemnifications

In addition, as part of commercial contract negotiations in the normal course of business, the Company may sometimes agree to make payments to compensate
or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may involve an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or
interpretation of the tax law. The Company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts because events that would obligate the Company have not yet occurred or, if any such event has
occurred, the Company has not been notified of its occurrence. However, at December 31, 2002, management believes future payments, if any, that could ultimately become payable under these contract provisions, would not have a material impact on its
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Note 5.

Preferred Stock

The Company is authorized to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock. The Company issued 665,000 shares of Series A mandatorily convertible preferred stock, liquidation preference $1,000 per share, to Piedmont Share
Trust (Piedmont Trust) in connection with the formation of Dominion Fiber Ventures LLC (DFV) and the issuance of senior notes by DFV. The Company is the beneficial owner of the Piedmont Trust. For more information about the Company’s investment
in DFV, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2002 Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8.

Dividend Restrictions

The Company received dividends from its consolidated subsidiaries in the amounts of $945 million, $806 million and $1.3
billion for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The 1935 Act and related regulations issued by the SEC impose
restrictions on the transfer and receipt of funds by a registered holding company from its subsidiaries, including a general prohibition against loans or advances being made by the subsidiaries to benefit the registered holding company. Under the
1935 Act, registered holding companies and their subsidiaries may pay dividends only from retained earnings, unless the SEC specifically authorizes payments from other capital accounts. In response to the Company’s request, the SEC granted
relief in 2000, authorizing payment of dividends by CNG from other capital accounts to the Company in amounts up to $1.6 billion, representing CNG’s retained earnings prior to the Company’s acquisition of CNG. Furthermore, the Company has
submitted a similar request to the SEC in 2002, seeking relief from this restriction in regard to its subsidiary, into which Louis Dreyfus was merged. The application requests relief up to $303 million, representing Louis Dreyfus’ retained
earnings prior to the Company’s

acquisition of Louis Dreyfus. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock at declared rates was not impacted by the restriction
discussed above during 2002, 2001 and 2000.

The Virginia State Corporation Commission may prohibit any public service
company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a dividend to an affiliate, if found not to be in the public interest. At December 31, 2002, the Virginia Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by Virginia Power.

Certain agreements associated with the Company’s credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total
capitalization. These limitations did not restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002.

See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2002 Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8., for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by the Company in connection with
the deferral of payments on the affiliated notes that are held as assets by certain subsidiary capital trusts of the Company.
