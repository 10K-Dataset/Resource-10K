Part I

Item 1. Business

G

ENERAL

Dominion

, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and
incorporated in Virginia in 1983, is one of the nation’s largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominion’s strategy is to be a leading provider of electricity, natural gas and related services to customers primarily in the eastern
region of the U.S. Dominion’s portfolio of assets includes approximately 27,615 MW of generating capacity, 6,100 miles of electric transmission lines, 56,800 miles of electric distribution lines, 11,000 miles of natural gas transmission,
gathering and storage pipeline and 21,800 miles of gas distribution pipeline, exclusive of service lines of two inches in diameter or less. Dominion also owns the nation’s largest underground natural gas storage system, operates approximately
947 bcf of storage capacity and serves retail energy customers in 14 states.

Dominion is focused on expanding its investment
in regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution and regulated natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure within and around its existing footprint. As a result, regulated capital projects will continue to receive
priority treatment in its spending plans. Dominion expects this will increase its earnings contribution from regulated operations, while reducing the sensitivity of its earnings to commodity prices.

In 2010, Dominion announced plans to invest more than $10 billion over the next five years to expand and improve its regulated electric
and natural gas businesses. A substantial portion of this investment will be essential to meet the anticipated increase in electricity demand in its service territory. Other drivers for the capital investment program include the need to construct
infrastructure to handle the expected increase in natural gas production from the Marcellus Shale formation and upgrades to its gas distribution and electric transmission and distribution network. Dominion also announced that it may invest up to an
additional $2 billion in its electric generating fleet to meet potential new environmental requirements.

Dominion’s
nonregulated operations include merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities and retail energy marketing operations. Dominion’s operations are conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power.

Virginia Power

, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1909 as a Virginia public service
corporation, is a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and North Carolina. In Virginia, Virginia Power conducts business under the name “Dominion Virginia Power.” In North
Carolina, it conducts business under the name “Dominion North Carolina Power” and serves retail customers located in the northeastern region of the state, excluding certain municipalities. In addition, Virginia Power sells electricity at
wholesale prices to rural electric cooperatives, municipalities and into wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Power’s common stock is owned by Dominion.

Amounts disclosed for Dominion are inclusive of Virginia Power, where applicable.

E

MPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2010, Dominion had approximately 15,800 full-time employees, of which approximately 5,900 employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. As of
December 31, 2010, Virginia Power had approximately 6,800 full-time employees, of which approximately 3,000 employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. See Note 23 for discussion of the Companies’ workforce reduction
program.

EGMENTS

Dominion manages its daily operations through three primary operating segments: DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy. Dominion
also reports a Corporate and Other segment, which includes its corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt) and the net impact of Peoples and certain DCI operations, which are discussed in Notes 4 and 25 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominion’s operating segments that are not included in profit

measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’ performance or allocating resources among the segments.

Virginia Power manages its daily operations through two primary operating segments: DVP and Dominion Generation. It also reports a
Corporate and Other segment that primarily includes specific items attributable to its operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’ performance or allocating resources
among the segments.

While daily operations are managed through the operating segments previously discussed, assets remain
wholly-owned by Dominion and Virginia Power and their respective legal subsidiaries.

A description of the operations included
in the Companies’ primary operating segments is as follows:

For additional financial
information on operating segments, including revenues from external customers, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on operating revenue related to Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s principal
products and services, see Notes 2 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

DVP

The DVP Operating Segment of Virginia Power

includes Virginia Power’s regulated electric transmission and distribution (including customer service) operations, which serve residential,
commercial, industrial and governmental customers in Virginia and North Carolina.

In December 2010, Virginia Power announced
its five-year investment plan, which includes spending approximately $4 billion to upgrade or add new transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory and
maintain reliability. The proposed electric delivery infrastructure projects are intended to address both continued population growth and increases in electricity consumption by the typical consumer.

Revenue provided by electric distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state
law. Changes in revenue are driven primarily by changes in rates, weather, customer growth and other factors impacting consumption such as the economy and energy conservation. Variability in earnings results from changes in rates, weather, the
economy, customer growth and operating and maintenance expenditures. Operationally, electric distribution continues to focus on improving service levels while striving to reduce costs and link investments to operational results. As a result,
electric



service reliability and customer service have improved. SAIDI, excluding major storm events, has also steadily improved. The three-year average SAIDI has improved from 135 minutes at the end of
2005 to 114 minutes at the end of 2010. Likewise, ASA has also shown significant improvement. The three-year average ASA has improved from 73 seconds at the end of 2005 to 42 seconds at the end of 2010. Customer service options are also being
enhanced and expanded through the use of technology. Customers now have the ability to use the Internet for routine billing and payment transactions, connecting and disconnecting service, reporting outages and obtaining outage updates. As electric
distribution moves forward, safety, electric service reliability and customer service will remain key focal areas.

Revenue
provided by Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by FERC. The profitability of this business is dependent on its ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a
reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in rates and the timing of property additions, retirements and depreciation.

Virginia Power is a member of PJM, an RTO, and its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM wholesale electricity markets. Consistent with the increased authority given to NERC by EPACT,
Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations are committed to meeting NERC standards, modernizing their infrastructure and maintaining superior system reliability. Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations will continue to
focus on safety, operational performance, NERC compliance and execution of PJM’s RTEP.

The DVP Operating Segment of
Dominion

includes all of Virginia Power’s regulated electric transmission and distribution operations as discussed above, as well as Dominion’s nonregulated retail energy marketing operations.

Dominion’s retail energy marketing operations compete in nonregulated energy markets and have continued to experience customer growth
during the past few years. The retail business requires limited capital investment and currently employs approximately 160 people. The retail customer base is diversified across three product lines—natural gas, electricity and home warranty
services. In natural gas, Dominion has a heavy concentration of customers in markets where utilities have a long-standing commitment to customer choice. In electricity, Dominion pursues markets where utilities have divested of generation assets and
where customers are permitted and have opted to purchase from the market. Major growth drivers are customer additions, new markets, products and sales channels and supply optimization.

C

OMPETITION

DVP Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

Within Virginia Power’s service territory in Virginia and North Carolina, there is no competition for electric distribution service.
Additionally, since its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM, electric transmission services are administered by PJM and are not subject to competition in relation to transmission service provided to customers within the PJM
region. Virginia Power is seeing continued growth in new customers in its transmission and distribution operations.

DVP Operating Segment—Dominion

Dominion’s retail energy marketing operations compete against incumbent utilities and other energy marketers in nonregulated energy markets for natural gas and electricity. Customers in these markets
have the right to select a retail marketer and typically do so based upon price savings or price stability; however, incumbent utilities have the advantage of long-standing relationships with their customers and greater name recognition in their
markets.

R

EGULATION

Virginia Power’s electric retail service, including the rates it may charge to jurisdictional customers, is subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission.
Virginia Power’s electric transmission rates, tariffs and terms of service are subject to regulation by FERC. Electric transmission siting authority remains the jurisdiction of the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. However, EPACT
provides FERC with certain backstop authority for transmission siting. See

State Regulations

and

Federal Regulations

in

Regulation

for additional information.

The Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation in April 2007 that instituted a modified cost-of-service rate model for the Virginia
jurisdiction of Virginia Power’s utility operations, subject to base rate caps in effect through December 31, 2008. Pursuant to this legislation, the Virginia Commission initiated a review of Virginia Power’s base rates in 2009. A
discussion of Virginia Power’s settlement of this case with the Virginia Commission is contained in

Electric Regulation in Virginia

under

Regulation

.

P

ROPERTIES

Virginia Power has approximately 6,100 miles of electric
transmission lines of 69 kV or more located in the states of North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Portions of Virginia Power’s electric transmission lines cross national parks and forests under permits entitling the federal government to
use, at specified charges, any surplus capacity that may exist in these lines. While Virginia Power owns and maintains its electric transmission facilities, they are a part of PJM, which coordinates the planning, operation, emergency assistance and
exchange of capacity and energy for such facilities.

Each year, as part of PJM’s RTEP process, reliability projects are
authorized. Virginia Power is involved in two of the major construction projects authorized in 2006, which are designed to improve the reliability of service to customers and the region—Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun and Carson-to-Suffolk.

In October 2008, the Virginia Commission authorized construction of the Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun line and affirmed the 65-mile route
proposed for the line which is adjacent to, or within, existing transmission line rights-of-way. The Virginia Commission’s approval of the Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun line was conditioned on the respective state commission approvals of both the
West Virginia and Pennsylvania portions of the transmission line. The West Virginia Commission’s approval of Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line Company’s application became effective in February 2009 and the Pennsylvania Commission granted
approval in December 2008. On appeal by the ECCP, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court affirmed in May 2010 the Pennsylvania Commission’s approval and subsequently denied a request for reargument by the ECCP in June 2010. The Meadow



Brook-to-Loudoun line is expected to cost approximately $255 million and be completed in June 2011.

In October 2008, the Virginia Commission authorized the construction of the Carson-to-Suffolk line. This project is estimated to cost $224 million and is expected to be completed in June 2011.

As part of subsequent annual PJM RTEP processes, PJM authorized additional electric transmission upgrade projects including
Hayes-to-Yorktown in December 2008 and Mt. Storm-to-Doubs in December 2010. In June 2010, the Virginia Commission authorized the construction of the Hayes-to-Yorktown line along the proposed eight-mile route utilizing existing easements and
property previously acquired for the transmission line right-of-way. In accordance with the Virginia Commission’s approval, approximately 4.2 miles of the Hayes-to-Yorktown line will be constructed overhead and approximately 3.8 miles will be
installed underground in order to cross under the York River. The Hayes-to-Yorktown line is expected to cost approximately $63 million and, subject to receipt of all regulatory approvals, is expected to be completed by June 2012.

After more than 44 years of operation, portions of the 99-mile Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line and certain associated facilities are approaching
the end of their expected service lives and require replacement with new facilities to maintain reliable service. Virginia Power owns and has been designated by PJM to rebuild the 96 miles of the line in West Virginia and Virginia, and The Potomac
Edison Company owns and has been designated by PJM to rebuild the remaining three miles of the line in Maryland. Subject to applicable state and federal regulatory approvals, Virginia Power’s portion of the rebuild project is expected to cost
approximately $300 million and is expected to be completed by June 2015.

In addition, Virginia Power’s electric
distribution network includes approximately 56,800 miles of distribution lines, exclusive of service level lines, in Virginia and North Carolina. The grants for most of its electric lines contain rights-of-way that have been obtained from the
apparent owner of real estate, but underlying titles have not been examined. Where rights-of-way have not been obtained, they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation, if necessary. Many electric lines are on publicly-owned property,
where permission to operate can be revoked.

EASONALITY

DVP Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

DVP’s earnings vary seasonally
as a result of the impact of changes in temperature and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet
cooling and heating needs. An increase in heating degree-days for DVP’s electric utility related operations does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree-days, due to seasonal pricing differentials and because
alternative heating sources are more readily available.

DVP Operating Segment—Dominion

The earnings of Dominion’s retail energy marketing operations also vary seasonally. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and
winter months to meet cooling and heating needs, while the demand for gas peaks during the winter months to meet heating needs.

Dominion Generation

The Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power

includes the generation operations of the Virginia Power regulated
electric utility and its related energy supply operations. Virginia Power’s utility generation operations primarily serve the supply requirements for the DVP segment’s utility customers. The generation mix is diversified and includes coal,
nuclear, gas, oil and renewables. The generation facilities of Virginia Power’s electric utility fleet are located in Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina. As discussed in

Properties

, Virginia Power has plans to add additional
generation capacity to satisfy future growth in its utility service area.

Earnings for the Generation operating segment of
Virginia Power primarily result from the sale of electricity generated by its utility fleet. Revenue is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Approximately 80% of revenue comes from serving Virginia
jurisdictional customers. Rates for the Virginia jurisdiction are set using a modified cost-of-service rate model, subject to base rate caps that were in effect through December 31, 2008. The cost of fuel and purchased power is generally
collected through fuel cost-recovery mechanisms established by regulators and does not materially impact net income. Variability in earnings for Virginia Power’s generation operations results from changes in rates, the demand for services,
which is primarily weather dependent, and labor and benefit costs, as well as the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. See

Regulation—State Regulations

for additional information, including a discussion of
Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case settlement with the Virginia Commission.

The Dominion Generation Operating
Segment of Dominion

includes Virginia Power’s generation facilities and its related energy supply operations described above as well as the generation operations of Dominion’s merchant fleet and energy marketing and price risk
management activities for these assets. The generation facilities of Dominion’s merchant fleet are located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The Generation



operating segment of Dominion derives its earnings primarily from the sale of electricity generated by Virginia Power’s utility and Dominion’s merchant generation assets, as well as
associated capacity from Dominion’s merchant generation assets.

Variability in earnings provided by Dominion’s
merchant fleet relates to changes in market-based prices received for electricity and capacity. Market-based prices for electricity are largely dependent on commodity prices, primarily natural gas, and the demand for electricity, which is primarily
dependent upon weather. Capacity prices are dependent upon resource requirements in relation to the supply available (both existing and new) in the forward capacity auctions, which are held approximately three years in advance of the associated
delivery year. Dominion manages electric and capacity price volatility of its merchant fleet by hedging a substantial portion of its expected near-term sales with derivative instruments and also entering into long-term power sales agreements.
However, earnings have been adversely impacted due to a sustained decline in commodity prices. Variability also results from changes in the cost of fuel consumed, labor and benefits and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled
outages.

C

OMPETITION

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

Virginia
Power’s generation operations are not subject to significant competition as only a limited number of its Virginia jurisdictional electric utility customers have retail choice. See

Regulation—State Regulations—Electric

for more
information. Currently, North Carolina does not offer retail choice to electric customers.

Dominion Generation Operating
Segment—Dominion

Unlike Dominion Generation’s regulated generation fleet, its merchant generation fleet is dependent on its
ability to operate in a competitive environment and does not have a predetermined rate structure that allows for a rate of return on its capital investments. Competition for the merchant fleet is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market
entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. These competitive factors may
negatively impact the merchant fleet’s ability to profit from the sale of electricity and related products and services.

Dominion Generation’s merchant generation fleet owns and operates several facilities in the Midwest that operate within functioning
RTOs. A significant portion of the output from these facilities is sold under long-term contracts, with expiration dates ranging from December 31, 2012 to August 31, 2017, and is therefore largely unaffected by price competition during the
term of these contracts. Following expiration of these contracts, earnings could be adversely impacted if prevailing prices for energy, capacity and ancillary services are lower than the levels currently received under these contracts.

Dominion Generation’s other merchant assets also operate within functioning RTOs and primarily compete on the basis of price.
Competitors include other generating assets bidding to operate within the RTOs. These RTOs have clearly identified

market rules that ensure the competitive wholesale market is functioning properly. Dominion Generation’s merchant units have a variety of short- and medium-term contracts, and also compete
in the spot market with other generators to sell a variety of products including energy, capacity and ancillary services. It is difficult to compare various types of generation given the wide range of fuels, fuel procurement strategies, efficiencies
and operating characteristics of the fleet within any given RTO. However, Dominion applies its expertise in operations, dispatch and risk management to maximize the degree to which its merchant fleet is competitive compared to similar assets within
the region.

R

EGULATION

Virginia Power’s utility generation fleet and Dominion’s merchant generation fleet are subject to regulation by FERC, the NRC, the EPA, the DOE, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal,
state and local authorities. Virginia Power’s utility generation fleet is also subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission. See

P

ROPERTIES

For a listing of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s existing generation facilities, see Item 2. Properties.

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

Based on available
generation capacity and current estimates of growth in customer demand in its utility service area, Virginia Power will need additional generation capacity over the next decade. Virginia Power has announced a comprehensive generation growth program,
referred to as

Powering Virginia

, which involves the development, financing, construction and operation of new multi-fuel, multi-technology generation capacity to meet the anticipated growing demand in its core market in Virginia. Significant
projects under construction or development include:

Ÿ

Bear Garden, which, once operational, will generate about 580 MW. This intermediate, combined-cycle, natural gas-fired power station and transmission
interconnection line is estimated to cost $619 million, excluding financing costs. Construction is approximately 94% complete as of January 2011, with commercial operations expected to commence in the second quarter of 2011.

Ÿ

The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center located in Wise County, Virginia, which once operational, will generate about 585 MW. The baseload facility is
estimated to cost $1.8 billion, excluding financing costs. Construction is approximately 79% complete as of January 2011, and commercial operations are expected to commence in the summer of 2012.

Ÿ

A power station development project in Warren County, Virginia, intended to be developed as an intermediate, combined-cycle, natural gas-fired power
station. In December 2010, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality approved an air permit to construct the project. Subject to the receipt of additional regulatory approvals, the project is expected to generate more than 1,300 MW of
electricity. If the project is approved, construction would begin in 2012, with commercial operations expected to commence by late 2014 or early 2015.



In addition to the projects above, Virginia Power is considering the construction of a
third nuclear unit at a site located at North Anna, which Virginia Power owns along with ODEC. Virginia Power and ODEC have obtained an Early Site Permit for the North Anna site from the NRC. In November 2007, Virginia Power, along with ODEC, filed
an application with the NRC for a COL that references a specific reactor design and which would allow Virginia Power to build and operate a new nuclear unit at North Anna. In May 2010, Virginia Power announced its decision to replace the reactor
design previously selected for the potential third nuclear unit with the US-APWR technology.

In June 2010, Virginia Power and
ODEC amended the COL application to reflect the selection of the US-APWR technology. In January 2011, Virginia Power and the DOE terminated their cooperative agreement to share equally the cost of developing a COL. The agreement references the
technology previously selected by Virginia Power. DOE funding is not available under the agreement for activities related to the US-APWR technology. During the third and fourth quarters of 2010, Virginia Power filed several applications for
environmental permits that would be needed to support future construction and operation of a third nuclear unit at North Anna.

Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit at North Anna. In October 2010, Virginia Power announced its decision
to slow the development of the potential third reactor. Virginia Power will continue to pursue the COL, along with engineering and preliminary site development work, and will reassess a construction schedule prior to the issuance of the COL
currently anticipated in 2013. In December 2010, Virginia Power and MNES reached an agreement regarding pre-construction, engineering, design and planning work in preparation for a possible new unit at North Anna. In February 2011, ODEC informed
Virginia Power of its intent to no longer participate in the development of the new unit at North Anna. Virginia Power and ODEC are currently working together to finalize the terms and conditions of such withdrawal.

If Virginia Power decides to build the new unit, it must first receive a COL from the NRC, the approval of the Virginia Commission and
certain environmental permits and other approvals. The NRC is required to conduct a hearing in all COL proceedings. In August 2008, the ASLB of the NRC permitted BREDL to intervene in the proceeding. All of BREDL’s previous contentions in this
proceeding have been dismissed. In October 2010, BREDL submitted two new contentions that it seeks to litigate that Virginia Power has opposed. No other persons sought to intervene in the proceeding. Absent additional admitted contentions, the
mandatory NRC hearing will be uncontested with respect to other issues.

In April 2008, Virginia Power announced a joint effort
with BP to evaluate wind energy projects in Virginia. In December 2010, Virginia Power and BP terminated their joint development agreement for wind energy projects. As a result of the termination, Virginia Power has acquired a sole development
interest in several wind energy development projects in Virginia. Virginia Power paid BP approximately $1.5 million to acquire BP’s interest in property jointly owned in Tazewell County, Virginia.

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion

Dominion is a 50% owner with BP of the first phase of Fowler Ridge. Phase one has generating capacity of 300 MW and is in full commercial operation. In
December 2009, Dominion closed on an agreement with BP to split the 350 MW of development assets associated with the second phase of Fowler Ridge, with Dominion retaining 150 MW of these development assets. In December 2010, Dominion reached an
agreement to sell its 150 MW share of the development assets of the second phase to BP. Closing is subject to the approvals of FERC and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, which are expected by the second quarter of 2011. Dominion will
receive approximately $6 million of proceeds from the sale.

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

Dominion Generation uses a variety of fuels to power its electric generation and purchases power for utility system load requirements and to satisfy
physical forward sale requirements, as described below. Some of these agreements have fixed commitments and are included as contractual obligations in

Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures

in
Item 7. MD&A.

Nuclear Fuel—

Dominion Generation primarily utilizes long-term contracts to support its
nuclear fuel requirements. Worldwide market conditions are continuously evaluated to ensure a range of supply options at reasonable prices which are dependent on the market environment. Current agreements, inventories and spot market availability
are expected to support current and planned fuel supply needs. Additional fuel is purchased as required to ensure optimal cost and inventory levels.

Fossil Fuel—

Dominion Generation primarily utilizes coal, oil and natural gas in its fossil fuel plants. Dominion Generation’s coal supply is obtained through long-term contracts and
short-term spot agreements from both domestic and international suppliers.

Dominion Generation’s natural gas and oil
supply is obtained from various sources including: purchases from major and independent producers in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions, purchases from local producers in the Appalachian area, purchases from gas marketers and withdrawals from
underground storage fields owned by Dominion or third parties.

Dominion Generation manages a portfolio of natural gas
transportation contracts (capacity) that allows flexibility in delivering natural gas to its gas turbine fleet, while minimizing costs.

Purchased Power—

Dominion Generation purchases electricity from the PJM spot market and through power purchase agreements with other suppliers to provide for utility system load requirements.

Dominion Generation also occasionally purchases electricity from the PJM, ISO-NE and MISO spot markets to satisfy physical
forward sale requirements as part of its merchant generation operations.



Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Virginia Power

Presented below is a summary of Virginia Power’s actual system output by energy source:

(1)

Excludes ODEC’s 50.0% ownership interest in the Clover power station. The average cost of coal for 2010 Virginia in-system generation was $36.25 per MWh.

(2)

Excludes ODEC’s 11.6% ownership interest in North Anna.

(3)

Includes oil, hydro and biomass.

S

EASONALITY

Sales of
electricity for Dominion Generation typically vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. Generally, the demand for
electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. An increase in heating degree-days does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree-days, due to seasonal pricing differentials
and because alternative heating sources are more readily available.

ECOMMISSIONING

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

Virginia Power has a total of four licensed, operating nuclear reactors at Surry and North Anna in Virginia.

Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. Amounts
collected from ratepayers and placed into trusts have been invested to fund the expected future costs of decommissioning the Surry and North Anna units.

Virginia Power believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs, particularly when combined
with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects the long-term investment horizon, since the units will not be decommissioned for decades,
and a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns. Virginia Power will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC’s minimum financial assurance requirement, which may include the use of parent company
guarantees, surety bonding or other financial guarantees recognized by the NRC.

The total estimated cost to decommission
Virginia Power’s four nuclear units is $2.2 billion in 2010 dollars and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed in 2009. The current cost estimates assume decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of
operations, which will occur when the operating licenses expire. Virginia Power expects to decommission the Surry and North Anna units during the period 2032 to 2067.

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion

In addition to the four nuclear units discussed above, Dominion has three other licensed, operating nuclear reactors: two at Millstone in Connecticut and
one at Kewaunee in Wisconsin. A third Millstone unit ceased operations before Dominion acquired the power station. As part of Dominion’s acquisition of both Millstone and Kewaunee, it acquired decommissioning funds for the related units. Any
funds remaining in Kewaunee’s trust after decommissioning is completed are required to be refunded to Wisconsin ratepayers.

Dominion believes that the amounts currently available in the decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to
cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone and Kewaunee units. Dominion will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC’s minimum financial assurance requirement, which may include the use of parent company
guarantees, surety bonding or other financial guarantees recognized by the NRC. The total estimated cost to decommission Dominion’s eight units is $4.6 billion in 2010 dollars and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed in 2009.
For the Millstone and Kewaunee operating units, the current cost estimate assumes decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations, which will occur when the operating licenses expire. Millstone Unit 1 is not in service
and selected minor decommissioning activities are being performed. This unit will continue to be monitored until full decommissioning activities begin for the remaining Millstone operating units. Dominion expects to start minor decommissioning
activities at Millstone Unit 2 in 2035, with full decommissioning of Millstone Units 1, 2 and 3 during the period 2045 to 2069.

In August 2008, Dominion filed an application with the NRC to renew the Kewaunee operating license. In February 2011, the NRC renewed the
operating license, extending Kewaunee’s operation an additional 20 years through 2033. Full decommissioning of Kewaunee is expected during the period 2033 to 2065.



The estimated decommissioning costs and license expiration dates for the nuclear units
owned by Dominion and Virginia Power are shown in the following table.

(1)

North Anna is jointly owned by Virginia Power (88.4%) and ODEC (11.6%). However, Virginia Power is responsible for 89.26% of the decommissioning obligation.
Amounts reflect 100% of the decommissioning cost for both of North Anna’s units.

(2)

Unit 1 ceased operations in 1998, before Dominion’s acquisition of Millstone.

(3)

Millstone Unit 3 is jointly owned by Dominion, Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company and Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, who hold a 6.53%
undivided interest in Unit 3. Amounts reflect 100% of the decommissioning cost for Millstone Unit 3.

(4)

Kewaunee Unit 1 original license expiration year is 2013, however, the cost estimate is based on the license renewal expiration year of 2033.

Dominion Energy

Dominion Energy includes Dominion’s regulated natural gas distribution companies, regulated gas transmission pipeline and storage operations, natural
gas gathering and by-products extraction activities and regulated LNG operations. Dominion Energy also includes producer services, which aggregates natural gas supply, engages in natural gas trading and marketing activities and natural gas supply
management and provides price risk management services to Dominion affiliates.

The gas transmission pipeline and storage
business serves gas distribution businesses and other customers in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Included in Dominion’s gas transmission pipeline and storage business is its gas gathering and extraction activity, which sells
extracted products at market rates. Revenue provided by Dominion’s regulated gas transmission and storage and LNG operations is based primarily on rates established by FERC. Dominion’s gas distribution operations serve residential,
commercial and industrial gas sales and transportation customers. Revenue provided by its gas distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by the Ohio and West Virginia Commissions. The profitability of these businesses is
dependent on Dominion’s ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings results from operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as
changes in rates and the

demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy.

In October 2008, East Ohio implemented a rate case settlement which began a transition to a straight-fixed-variable rate design. Under this rate design, East Ohio recovers a larger portion of its fixed
operating costs through a flat monthly charge accompanied by a reduced volumetric base delivery rate. Accordingly, East Ohio’s revenue is less impacted by weather-related fluctuations in natural gas consumption than under the traditional rate
design.

Revenue from Dominion’s gas transportation, gas storage and LNG storage and regasification services are largely
based on firm, fee-based contractual arrangements.

Earnings from Dominion Energy’s nonregulated business, producer
services, are subject to variability associated with changes in commodity prices. Producer services uses physical and financial arrangements to hedge this price risk.

C

OMPETITION

Dominion Energy’s gas transmission operations compete with
domestic and Canadian pipeline companies. Dominion also competes with gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services. Alternative energy sources, such as oil or coal, provide another level of competition.
Although competition is based primarily on price, the array of services that can be provided to customers is also an important factor. The combination of capacity rights held on certain long-line pipelines, a large storage capability and the
availability of numerous receipt and delivery points along its own pipeline system enable Dominion to tailor its services to meet the needs of individual customers.

Retail competition for gas supply exists to varying degrees in the two states in which Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries operate. In Ohio, there has been no legislation enacted to require
supplier choice for residential and commercial natural gas consumers. However, Dominion has offered an Energy Choice program to customers, in cooperation with the Ohio Commission. West Virginia does not require customer choice in its retail natural
gas markets at this time. See

Regulation—State Regulations—Gas

ROPERTIES

Dominion Energy’s gas distribution network is located in the states of Ohio and West Virginia. This network involves approximately 21,800 miles of
pipe, exclusive of service lines of two inches in diameter or less. The rights-of-way grants for many natural gas pipelines have been obtained from the actual owner of real estate, as underlying titles have been examined. Where rights-of-way have
not been obtained, they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation, if necessary. Many natural gas pipelines are on publicly-owned property, where company rights and actions are determined on a case-by-case basis, with



results that range from reimbursed relocation to revocation of permission to operate.

Dominion Energy has approximately 11,000 miles of gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines located in the states of Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Dominion
Energy operates 20 underground gas storage fields located in New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, with almost 2,000 storage wells and approximately 262,000 acres of operated leaseholds.

The total designed capacity of the underground storage fields operated by Dominion Energy is approximately 947 bcf. Certain storage fields
are jointly-owned and operated by Dominion Energy. The capacity of those fields owned by Dominion’s partners totals about 242 bcf. Dominion Energy also has about 15 bcf of above-ground storage capacity at Cove Point. Dominion Energy has about
123 compressor stations with more than 768,000 installed compressor horsepower.

In July 2008, East Ohio launched the PIR
program to replace approximately 20% of its 21,000-mile pipeline system. The project, which is anticipated to cost approximately $2.6 billion, primarily involves the replacement of East Ohio’s bare steel, cast iron, wrought iron and copper pipe
over a 25-year period. As part of this program, East Ohio will assume ownership of curb-to-meter service lines and will be responsible for line repairs or replacement. In October 2008, the Ohio Commission approved cost recovery for an initial
five-year period of the PIR program.

In 2006, FERC approved the proposed expansion of Dominion’s Cove Point terminal and
DTI pipeline and the commencement of construction of the project. The expansion project included the installation of two new LNG storage tanks at Dominion’s Cove Point terminal, each capable of storing 160,000 cubic meters of LNG, pumps,
gas-turbine generators, and vaporization capacity to increase the terminal send-out by 800,000 dekatherms per day. Dominion installed 48 miles of 36-inch pipeline to increase the terminal take-away capacity to approximately 1,800,000 dekatherms per
day. In addition, Dominion’s DTI gas pipeline and storage system was expanded by building approximately 120 miles of pipeline, two new compressor stations in Pennsylvania and upgrades to other compressor stations in West Virginia and New York.
The DTI facilities associated with the Cove Point expansion project were placed into service in December 2008, the Cove Point LNG terminal expansion was placed into service in January 2009 and the remainder of the expanded Cove Point facilities were
placed into commercial service in March 2009.

In March 2010, Dominion commenced construction of the Cove Point Pier
Reinforcement Project. The $50 million project is intended to upgrade, expand and modify the existing pier at the Cove Point terminal to accommodate the next generation of LNG vessels (up to 267,000 cubic meters) that are much larger than what can
currently be accommodated (no larger than 148,000 cubic meters). The project commenced with the south berth being taken temporarily out of service to accommodate construction activities. In October 2010, Dominion requested and received FERC
authorization to re-commence service from the south berth of the pier for vessels with cargo capacities of no greater than 148,000 cubic meters. When the south berth was returned to service, construction commenced on the north berth, which was taken
out of service. In December 2010, Dominion

requested and received authorization to place the project in service on January 21, 2011.

DTI has announced the Gathering Enhancement Project, a $253 million expansion of its natural gas gathering, processing and liquids facilities in West Virginia. The project is designed to increase the
efficiency and reduce high pressures in its gathering system, thus increasing the amount of natural gas local producers can move through DTI’s West Virginia system. Construction started in 2009 and is expected to be completed by the fourth
quarter of 2012. The cost of the project will be paid for by rates charged to producers.

DTI has also announced the proposed
development of the Keystone Connector Project, a joint venture with The Williams Companies that would transport new natural gas supplies from the Appalachian Basin to Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation’s Station 195, providing access to
markets throughout the eastern U.S. DTI is currently in discussions regarding the continued development of the Keystone Connector Project. Project timing is subject to producer drilling plans in the Appalachian Basin, as well as customer demand
throughout the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.

DTI has announced the proposed development of a gas pipeline project, known
as the Appalachian Gateway Project. The project is expected to provide approximately 484,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation services for new Appalachian gas supplies from the supply areas in the Appalachian Basin in West Virginia and
southwestern Pennsylvania to an interconnection with Texas Eastern Transmission, LP at Oakford, Pennsylvania. Plans call for construction to start in 2011, with transportation services to begin by September 2012. An open season concluded in
September 2008 and the project is fully subscribed under long-term binding agreements. In June 2010, DTI filed a certificate application with the FERC seeking approval for the Appalachian Gateway project. DTI estimates the cost of the Appalachian
Gateway project to be approximately $634 million.

In June 2010, DTI entered into a 15-year firm transportation agreement with
the gas subsidiary of CONSOL. The project, known as the Northeast Expansion Project, is expected to provide approximately 200,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation services for CONSOL’s Marcellus Shale natural gas production from
various receipt points in central and southwestern Pennsylvania to a nexus of market pipelines and storage facilities in Leidy, Pennsylvania. The $97 million project will involve the construction by DTI of new compression facilities at three
existing compressor stations in central Pennsylvania, subject to the receipt of regulatory approval. In November 2010, DTI filed a certificate application with FERC seeking approval for the Northeast Expansion Project. If the project is approved,
construction is expected to begin in March 2012, with a projected in-service date of November 2012.

In August 2010, DTI
entered into a 10-year lease agreement with TGP for firm capacity to move Marcellus shale natural gas supplies from TGP’s 300 Line pipeline system in northern Pennsylvania to its 200 Line pipeline system in upstate New York. The $46 million
project, known as the Ellisburg-to-Craigs Project, is expected to have capacity of approximately 150,000 dekatherms per day. Subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, the project will involve the construction by DTI of additional compression
facilities and a new measurement and regulating station at the



Craigs interconnect with TGP in New York. DTI filed a certificate application with FERC in November 2010. If the Ellisburg-to-Craigs Project is approved, construction is expected to begin in
March 2012, with a planned in-service date of November 2012.

In January 2011, Dominion announced that DTI is developing a
natural gas processing and fractionation facility near New Martinsville, West Virginia. Dominion reached an agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. to purchase 56 acres at the Natrium site where DTI plans to process natural gas and NGLs.

Dominion Energy’s natural gas supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions, local producers in the
Appalachian area and gas marketers. Dominion’s large underground natural gas storage network and the location of its pipeline system are a significant link between the country’s major interstate gas pipelines, including the Rockies Express
East pipeline, and large markets in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. Dominion’s pipelines are part of an interconnected gas transmission system, which provides access to supplies nationwide for local distribution companies, marketers,
power generators and industrial and commercial customers.

Dominion’s underground storage facilities play an important
part in balancing gas supply with consumer demand and are essential to serving the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. In addition, storage capacity is an important element in the effective management of both gas supply and pipeline
transmission capacity.

S

EASONALITY

Dominion Energy’s natural gas distribution business earnings vary seasonally, as a result of the impact of changes in temperature on demand by residential and commercial customers for gas to meet
heating needs. Historically, the majority of these earnings have been generated during the heating season, which is generally from November to March, however implementation of the straight fixed variable rate design at East Ohio has reduced the
earnings impact of weather-related fluctuations. Demand for services at Dominion’s pipeline and storage business can also be weather sensitive. Commodity prices can be impacted by seasonal weather changes, the effects of weather on operations
and the economy. Dominion’s producer services business is affected by seasonal changes in the prices of commodities that it transports, stores and actively markets and trades.

TRATEGY

Dominion and Virginia Power are committed to being good environmental stewards. Their ongoing objective is to
provide reliable, affordable energy for their customers while being environmentally responsible. The integrated strategy to meet this objective consists of five major elements:

Ÿ

Compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules;

Ÿ

Conservation and load management;

Ÿ

Renewable generation development;

Ÿ

Other generation development to maintain fuel diversity, including clean coal, advanced nuclear energy, and natural gas; and

Ÿ

Improvements in other energy infrastructure.

See

in this item for examples of the Companies’ efforts to reduce their impact on the environment.

Environmental Compliance

Dominion and Virginia
Power remain committed to compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules related to their operations. Additional information related to Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s environmental compliance obligations can be
found in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Conservation and Load Management

Conservation plays a significant role in meeting the growing demand for electricity. The Regulation Act provides incentives for energy conservation and
sets a voluntary goal to reduce electricity consumption by retail customers in 2022 by ten percent of the amount consumed in 2006 through the implementation of conservation programs. Legislation in 2009 added definitions of peak-shaving and energy
efficiency programs and allowed for a margin on operating expenses and revenue reductions related to energy efficiency programs. Virginia Power’s DSM programs provide the first steps toward achieving the voluntary ten percent energy
conservation goal.

Virginia Power continues to assess smart grid technologies through a demonstration designed to indicate how
these technologies may enhance Virginia Power’s electric distribution system by allowing energy to be delivered more efficiently. The demonstration involves a limited deployment, within Virginia Power’s Virginia service territory, of smart
meters that use digital technology to enable two-way communication between the meter and Virginia Power’s electric distribution system. Dependent upon the outcome of the demonstration and certain regulatory proceedings, Virginia Power may make
a significant investment in replacing existing meters with Advanced Metering Infrastructure. The technology is intended to help customers monitor and control their energy use. It is also expected to lead to more efficient



use of the power grid, which is expected to result in energy savings and lower environmental emissions.

Additionally, the conservation and load management plan includes the following DSM programs, which were approved by the Virginia Commission in March 2010:

Ÿ

Residential Lighting Program—an instant, in-store discount on the purchase of qualifying compact fluorescent lights;

Ÿ

Home Energy Improvement—energy audits and improvements for homes of low-income customers;

Ÿ

Smart Cooling Rewards—incentives for residential customers who voluntarily enroll to allow Virginia Power to cycle their air conditioners and heat
pumps during periods of peak demand;

Ÿ

Commercial HVAC Upgrade Program—incentives for commercial customers to improve the energy efficiency of their heating and/or cooling units; and

Ÿ

Commercial Lighting Program—incentives for commercial customers to install energy-efficient lighting.

Virginia Power has also proposed a redesigned distributed generation program which was not approved in its original form by the Virginia
Commission in 2010. Virginia Power plans to seek Virginia Commission approval of the redesigned distributed generation program and several other DSM programs in 2011.

In September 2010, Virginia Power filed with the North Carolina Commission an application for approval and cost recovery of the DSM programs listed above, as well as the redesigned distributed generation
program. In February 2011, the North Carolina Commission approved the five DSM programs listed above. The North Carolina Commission will make a decision regarding the appropriate rate making treatment for the programs in a separate proceeding.
Virginia Power expects to launch the five DSM programs within its North Carolina service territory in the second quarter of 2011, subject to cost recovery approval by the North Carolina Commission. Virginia Power’s request for approval of the
redesigned distributed generation program remains pending before the North Carolina Commission.

Renewable Generation

Renewable energy is also an important component of a diverse and reliable energy mix. Both Virginia and North Carolina have passed legislation setting
targets for renewable power. Virginia Power is committed to meeting Virginia’s goals of 12% renewable power by 2022 and 15% by 2025 and North Carolina’s RPS of 12.5% by 2021. In May 2010, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia
Power’s participation in the state’s RPS program. As a participant, Virginia Power is permitted to seek recovery, through rate adjustment clauses, of costs of programs designed to meet RPS goals. Virginia Power plans to meet the respective
RPS targets in Virginia and North Carolina by utilizing existing renewable facilities, as well as the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, which is expected to use at least 10% biomass. In addition, Virginia Power intends to purchase renewable energy
certificates, as permitted by each RPS program, to meet any remaining annual requirement needs. Virginia Power continues to explore opportunities to develop new renewable facilities within its service territory, the energy attributes of which would
qualify for inclusion in the RPS programs.

In June 2010, Virginia Power announced its plans to develop an integrated solar and
battery storage demonstration project in

Halifax County, Virginia. The proposed facility is intended to manage, store, and optimize solar energy to regulate intermittency, enable peak shaving and increase grid reliability. In November
2010, the Virginia Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission approved a $5 million grant to help fund the proposed project. Other project participants are the Halifax County Industrial Development Authority, the University of
Virginia and a battery storage manufacturer. Subject to approval by the Virginia Commission and final project development, the 4 MW facility is expected to be operational in 2013.

In addition, Dominion is a 50% owner of NedPower. Dominion’s share of this project produces 132 MW of renewable energy.

Dominion is also a 50% owner with BP of the first phase of Fowler Ridge, which has a generating capacity of 300 MW. Dominion has a
long-term agreement with Fowler Ridge to purchase 200 MW of energy, capacity and environmental attributes from this first phase. In December 2010, Dominion reached an agreement to sell its remaining share of the development assets of the second
phase of Fowler Ridge to BP.

Other Generation Development

Virginia Power has announced a comprehensive generation growth program, referred to as

Powering Virginia

, which involves the development, financing, construction and operation of new multi-fuel,
multi-technology generation capacity to meet the anticipated growth in demand in its core market of Virginia. Virginia Power expects that these investments collectively will provide the following benefits: expanded electricity production capability,
increased technological and fuel diversity and a reduction in the CO


emission intensity of its generation fleet. One component of the

Powering Virginia

program involves consideration of the extent to which Virginia Power can reduce the carbon intensity of its
generation fleet by developing generation facilities with zero CO


and low CO


emissions, as well as economically viable facilities that can be equipped for CO


capture and storage. There are six generally recognized GHGs including
CO


, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride,
hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. The focus is on new generation because there is no current economically viable technological solution to retro-fit existing fossil-fueled technology to capture and store GHG emissions. Given that new
generation units have useful lives of up to 55 years, Virginia Power will consider CO


and other GHG emissions when making these long-term decisions. See

Dominion Generation

—Properties

for more information.

Improvements in Other Energy Infrastructure

In December 2010, Virginia Power announced its five-year
investment plan, which includes spending approximately $4 billion to upgrade or add new transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory and maintain reliability.
These enhancements are primarily aimed at meeting Virginia Power’s continued goal of providing reliable service, and are intended to address both continued population growth and increases in electricity consumption by the typical consumer. An
additional benefit will be added capacity to efficiently deliver electricity from the renewable projects now being developed or to be developed in the



future. See

Global Climate Change

Virginia Power is taking measures to ensure that its electrical infrastructure can support the expected demand from electric vehicles,
which have significantly lower carbon intensity than conventional vehicles. Virginia Power has partnered with Ford Motor Company to help prepare Virginia for the operation of electric vehicles, in a collaboration that involves consumer outreach,
educational programs and the exchange of information on vehicle charging requirements.

Virginia Power’s electric utility retail service is subject
to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission.

Virginia Power holds certificates of public
convenience and necessity which authorize it to maintain and operate its electric facilities now in operation and to sell electricity to customers. However, Virginia Power may not construct or incur financial commitments for construction of any
substantial generating facilities or large capacity transmission lines without the prior approval of various state and federal government agencies. In addition, the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission regulate Virginia Power’s
transactions with affiliates, transfers of certain facilities and the issuance of securities.

Electric Regulation in Virginia

Prior to the Regulation Act, which significantly changed electricity regulation in Virginia, Virginia Power’s Virginia jurisdictional base rates were
to be capped at 1999 levels until December 31, 2010, at which time Virginia was to convert to retail competition for its electric supply service. The Regulation Act ended capped rates two years early, on December 31, 2008, at which time
retail competition was made available only to individual retail customers with a demand of more than 5 MW and non-residential retail customers who obtain Virginia Commission approval to aggregate their load to reach the 5 MW threshold. Individual
retail customers are also permitted to purchase renewable energy from competitive suppliers if their incumbent electric utility does not offer a 100% renewable energy tariff.

The Regulation Act also authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation projects, FERC-approved transmission costs, environmental compliance, conservation and
energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs. The Regulation Act provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures on specific new generation projects, including but not limited to nuclear generation, clean coal/carbon capture
compatible generation and renewable generation projects. The Regulation Act also continues statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to file annual fuel cost recovery cases with the Virginia Commission.

Pursuant to the Regulation Act, the Virginia Commission entered an order in January 2009
initiating the 2009 Base Rate Review. In connection with the 2009 Base Rate Review, Virginia Power submitted base rate filings and accompanying schedules to the Virginia Commission during 2009. In February 2010, Virginia Power filed a revised
Stipulation and Recommendation with the Virginia Commission, which had the support of all of the interested parties, including the Staff of the Virginia Commission. Virginia Power’s fourth quarter 2009 results included a charge of $782 million
($477 million after-tax) representing its best estimate at the time of the probable outcome of the 2009 Base Rate Review. In March 2010, the Virginia Commission issued the Virginia Settlement Approval Order that concluded the 2009 Base Rate Review

An ROE of 11.3% for the 2010 rate year.

Commencing in 2011, the Virginia Commission will conduct biennial reviews of Virginia Power’s base rates, terms and conditions. In the biennial review, as in the 2009 Base Rate Review, Virginia
Power’s authorized ROE can be no lower than the average of that reported by not less than a majority of comparable utilities within the Southeastern U.S., with certain limitations as described in the Regulation Act. If Virginia Power’s
earnings are



more than 50 basis points above the authorized level, such earnings will be shared with customers.

Virginia Power previously filed with the Virginia Commission an application for approval and cost recovery of eleven DSM programs, including one peak-shaving program and ten energy efficiency programs.
Virginia Power plans to use DSM, along with its traditional and renewable supply-side resources, to meet its projected load growth over the next 15 years. The DSM programs provide the first steps toward achieving Virginia’s goal of reducing, by
2022, the electric energy consumption of Virginia Power’s retail customers by ten percent of what was consumed in 2006. In March 2010, the Virginia Commission approved the recovery of approximately $28 million for five of the DSM programs
through initiation of Riders C1 and C2, effective May 1, 2010. With respect to the other six DSM programs for which approval was sought, the Virginia Commission made a finding that they were not in the public interest at that time, but allowed
Virginia Power the opportunity for further evaluation of similar programs. In July 2010, Virginia Power submitted its annual update filing for Riders C1 and C2 with respect to the five approved DSM programs. The proposed revenue requirements for
Riders C1 and C2 were approximately $6 million and $18 million, respectively, which together represent a decrease of approximately $5 million compared to the Riders C1 and C2 revenue requirements included in customer rates currently in
effect. In February 2011, an evidentiary hearing was held by the Virginia Commission on Virginia Power’s update of Riders C1 and C2. The Virginia Commission is required to issue its order by March 30, 2011. Virginia Power plans to seek
Virginia Commission approval for several DSM programs in 2011. See

Environmental Strategy

for a description of Virginia Power’s DSM programs.

In connection with the Bear Garden and Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center projects, in June 2010, Virginia Power filed annual updates for Riders R and S, respectively, with the Virginia Commission.
Initially, Virginia Power proposed an approximately $86 million revenue requirement for Rider R for the April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012 rate year. Due to the application of accelerated tax depreciation provisions in the Small Business Jobs
Act of 2010, passed in September 2010, Virginia Power revised the requested revenue requirement for Rider R in November 2010 from $86 million to $78 million. The adjusted $78 million revenue requirement represents an increase of approximately
$14 million over the revenue requirement associated with the Rider R customer rates currently in effect. The proposed Rider S revenue requirement, effective April 1, 2011, for the rate year ending March 31, 2012 is approximately
$200 million, which represents an increase of $46 million over the revenue requirement associated with the Rider S customer rates currently in effect. The ROE included in both rider filings is 12.3%, which is consistent with the terms of the
Virginia Settlement Approval Order. In July 2010, the Virginia Commission issued orders with respect to Riders R and S, which adopted a placeholder ROE of 11.3% (not including the 100 basis point statutory enhancement) for use until the ROE is
determined in the context of Virginia Power’s upcoming biennial review. Evidentiary hearings were held by the Virginia Commission on Riders R and S in December and November 2010, respectively.

The Virginia Commission is required to issue its orders in these proceedings by March 30, 2011.

With respect to Virginia Power’s costs of transmission service, in June 2010, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power’s annual update to Rider T which was effective September 1,
2010, reflecting the revenue requirement of approximately $338 million recommended by the Virginia Commission Staff and agreed to by Virginia Power. The $338 million revenue requirement reflects an increase of approximately $118 million over the
previous revenue requirement.

In April 2010, Virginia Power filed its Virginia fuel factor application with the Virginia
Commission. The application requested an annual decrease in fuel expense recovery of approximately $82 million for the period July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. The proposed fuel factor went into effect on July 1, 2010 on an interim
basis. An evidentiary hearing on Virginia Power’s application was held in September 2010, and in October 2010, the Virginia Commission issued its final order approving the reduction in Virginia Power’s fuel factor as proposed in its
application.

If the Virginia Commission’s future rate decisions, including actions relating to Virginia Power’s
upcoming biennial review and rate adjustment clause filings, differ materially from Virginia Power’s expectations, it could adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

North Carolina Regulation

Virginia Power’s
North Carolina base rates have been subject to a five-year base rate moratorium, effective as of April 2005. Fuel rates continued to be subject to annual fuel rate adjustments, with deferred fuel accounting for over- or under-recoveries of fuel
costs.

In February 2010, in preparation for the end of the five-year base rate moratorium, Virginia Power filed an application
to increase its base rates and adjust its fuel rates. Virginia Power’s application included a proposal to recover proportionately more of its purchased power energy costs through fuel rates, which are adjusted annually, instead of being
recovered in base rates. In August 2010, Virginia Power filed its annual application for a change in its fuel rates, which updated the fuel application of February 2010 to reflect a proposed decrease of approximately $28 million when compared
to current fuel rates. Also in August 2010, Virginia Power updated its base rate application to seek a $27 million increase, instead of $29 million as originally proposed.

In September 2010, all parties to the base rate and fuel case except one, which did not oppose the settlement, filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Settlement and requested approval from the North
Carolina Commission. In December 2010, the North Carolina Commission issued the North Carolina Settlement Approval Order. The North Carolina Settlement Approval Order authorizes an increase in base revenues of approximately $8 million and a one-year
decrease in combined fuel revenues of approximately $32 million when compared to revenues produced from current rates. In addition, the North Carolina Settlement Approval Order permits the recovery through fuel rates of 85% of the net energy costs
of power purchases from both PJM and other wholesale suppliers and from the non-utility generators subject to economic dispatch that do not provide actual cost data. The



North Carolina Settlement Approval Order authorizes an ROE of 10.7% and a capital structure composed of 49% long-term debt and 51% common equity. Virginia Power does not agree that the foregoing
ROE represents its anticipated or actual cost of equity or capital structure, but accepted the resulting revenue requirement for the purpose of a global settlement of disputed issues in the proceedings. The new base and fuel rates became effective
on January 1, 2011.

Dominion’s gas distribution services are regulated by the Ohio Commission and the West Virginia Commission.

Status of Competitive Retail Gas Services

Both of the states in which Dominion has gas distribution
operations have considered legislation regarding a competitive deregulation of natural gas sales at the retail level.

Ohio

—Ohio has not enacted legislation requiring supplier choice for residential or commercial natural gas consumers. However,
in cooperation with the Ohio Commission, Dominion offers retail choice to residential and commercial customers. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1 million of Dominion’s 1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in this
Energy Choice program. In October 2006, East Ohio implemented a pilot program approved by the Ohio Commission as a transitional step towards the improvement and expansion of the Energy Choice program. Under the pilot program, East Ohio entered into
gas purchase contracts with selected suppliers at a fixed price above the NYMEX month-end settlement. This Standard Service Offer pricing mechanism replaced the traditional gas cost recovery rate with a monthly market price that eliminated the
true-up adjustment, making it easier for customers to compare and switch to competitive suppliers if they so choose.

In June
2008, the Ohio Commission approved a settlement filed in response to East Ohio’s application seeking approval of Phase 2 of its plan to restructure its commodity service. Under that settlement, the existing Standard Service Offer program was
continued through March 2009 with an update to the fixed rate adder to the NYMEX price. Starting in April 2009, East Ohio buys natural gas under the Standard Service Offer program for customers not eligible to participate in the Energy Choice
program and places Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct retail relationship with selected suppliers, which is designated on the customers’ bills. Subject to the Ohio Commission’s approval, East Ohio may eventually exit the gas
merchant function in Ohio entirely and have all customers select an alternate gas supplier. East Ohio continues to be the provider of last resort in the event of default by a supplier. Large industrial customers in Ohio also source their own natural
gas supplies.

West Virginia

—At this time, West Virginia has not enacted legislation to require customer choice in
the retail natural gas markets served by Hope. However, the West Virginia Commission has issued regulations to govern pooling services, one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customer choice in the future and has
issued rules requiring competitive gas service providers to be licensed in West Virginia.

Rates

Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries are subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of their businesses by the states in which

they operate—Ohio and West Virginia. When necessary, Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries seek general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs. In addition to
general rate increases, Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries make routine separate filings with their respective state regulatory commissions to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas. The majority of these purchased gas costs are
subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The purchased gas cost recovery filings
generally cover prospective one-, three- or twelve-month periods. Approved increases or decreases in gas cost recovery rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Ohio Commission approved an approximately $41 million annual base rate revenue increase and
an 8.49% allowed rate of return on rate base for East Ohio, which were reflected in revised base rates commencing December 22, 2008.

In October 2008, the Ohio Commission approved cost recovery for an initial five-year period of East Ohio’s 25-year PIR program to replace approximately 20% of its 21,000-mile pipeline system. In
August 2009, East Ohio filed an application with the Ohio Commission seeking approval of the first annual adjustment to the PIR cost recovery charge approved as part of East Ohio’s 2008 base rate case. The application included a revenue
requirement of approximately $16 million, which was subsequently reduced to approximately $13 million by an order issued by the Ohio Commission in December 2009. East Ohio opposed the order, however, its application for rehearing of the
decision was denied. In March 2010, East Ohio filed a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio alleging that the Ohio Commission’s order in the matter was unlawful, unjust and unreasonable. Dominion cannot predict the outcome of the
appeal, however, it is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations.

In August 2010, East Ohio filed its
second annual application to adjust the cost recovery charge associated with its PIR program for actual costs and a return on investments made through June 30, 2010. The application reflected a revenue requirement of approximately $28 million.
In November 2010, the Ohio Commission approved a settlement agreement filed by East Ohio and the Staff of the Ohio Commission reflecting a revenue requirement of approximately $27 million. Other interested parties to the case neither supported nor
objected to the settlement agreement.

Under the Ohio PIPP program, eligible customers can receive energy assistance based on
their ability to pay their bill. The difference between the customer’s total bill and the PIPP plan payment amount is deferred and collected under the PIPP rider in accordance with the rules of the Ohio Commission. Due to increased
participation in the program and increases in gas costs in the period since the previous rider rate went into effect, unrecovered costs increased. Accordingly, in March 2010, the Ohio Commission approved a 12-month recovery of approximately $259
million of uncollected receivables associated with the PIPP program, comprised of accumulated PIPP arrearages of $163 million and projected arrearages of $96 million for the 12 months that the PIPP rider rate will be in effect. The PIPP



rider rate went into effect in April 2010. The Ohio Commission directed East Ohio to file an application, with arrearages calculated on a calendar year basis, to update its PIPP rider within one
year of implementation of the new PIPP rider rate and annually thereafter.

In November 2010, rule changes adopted by the Ohio
Commission to the PIPP program became effective. The rule changes established a new program, PIPP Plus, which replaced PIPP. The PIPP Plus program reduces the customer’s monthly payments from 10% to 6% of household income and provides
for forgiveness credits to the customer’s balance when required payments are received in full by the due date. Such credits may result in the elimination of the customer’s arrearage balance over 24 months.

East Ohio files an annual UEX Rider with the Ohio Commission, pursuant to which it seeks recovery of the bad debt expense of most
customers not participating in PIPP Plus. The UEX Rider is adjusted annually to achieve dollar-for-dollar recovery of East Ohio’s actual write-offs of uncollectable amounts. In 2010, East Ohio deferred approximately $55 million of bad debt
expense for recovery through the UEX Rider.

In October 2008, Hope filed a request with the West Virginia Commission for an
increase in the base rates it charges for natural gas service. The requested new base rates would have increased Hope’s revenues by approximately $34 million annually. In November 2009, the West Virginia Commission authorized an approximately
$9 million increase in base rates. In June 2010, the West Virginia Commission authorized an additional base rate increase of less than $1 million to correct a miscalculation of rates attached to the November 2009 order.

Electric

Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Virginia Power purchases and sells electricity in the PJM wholesale
market and Dominion’s merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM, MISO and ISO-NE wholesale markets under Dominion’s market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC. In addition, Virginia Power has FERC approval of a tariff to sell
wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Power’s service territory. Any such sales would be voluntary.

In May 2005, FERC issued an order finding that PJM’s existing transmission service rate design may not be just and reasonable, and
ordered an investigation and hearings on the matter. In January 2008, FERC affirmed an earlier decision that the PJM transmission rate design for existing facilities had not become unjust and unreasonable. For recovery of costs of investments
of new PJM-planned transmission facilities that operate at or above 500 kV, FERC established a regional rate design where all customers pay a uniform rate based on the costs of such investment. For recovery of costs of investment in new PJM-planned
transmission facilities that operate below 500 kV, FERC affirmed its earlier decision to allocate costs on a beneficiary pays approach. A notice of appeal of this decision was filed in February 2008 at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit. In August

2009, the court denied the petition for review concerning the rate design for existing facilities, but granted the petition concerning the rate design for new facilities that operate at or above
500 kV, and remanded the issue of existing facilities back to FERC for further proceedings. Although Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the FERC proceedings on remand, the impact of any PJM rate design changes on the
Companies’ results of operations is not expected to be material.

Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to FERC’s
Standards of Conduct that govern conduct between transmission function employees of interstate gas and electricity transmission providers and the marketing function employees of their affiliates. The rule defines the scope of transmission and
marketing-related functions that are covered by the standards and is designed to prevent transmission providers from giving their affiliates undue preferences.

Dominion and Virginia Power are also subject to FERC’s affiliate restrictions that (1) prohibit power sales between Virginia Power and Dominion’s merchant plants without first receiving
FERC authorization, (2) require the merchant plants and Virginia Power to conduct their wholesale power sales operations separately, and (3) prohibit Virginia Power from sharing market information with merchant plant operating personnel.
The rules are designed to prohibit Virginia Power from giving the merchant plants a competitive advantage.

In April 2008, FERC
granted an application for Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January 1,
2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current
return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure.

In July 2008, Virginia Power filed an application
with FERC requesting a revision to its revenue requirement to reflect an additional ROE incentive adder for eleven electric transmission enhancement projects. Under the proposal, the cost of transmission service would increase to include an ROE
incentive adder for each of the eleven projects, beginning the date each project enters commercial operation (but not before January 1, 2009). Virginia Power proposed an incentive of 1.5% for four of the projects (including the Meadow
Brook-to-Loudoun line and Carson-to-Suffolk line) and an incentive of 1.25% for the other seven projects. In August 2008, FERC approved the proposal, effective September 1, 2008. The total cost for all eleven projects is estimated at $877
million, and all projects are currently expected to be completed by 2012. Numerous parties sought rehearing of the FERC order in August 2008 and rehearing is pending. Although Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the rehearing, it is not
expected to have a material effect on results of operations.

In March 2010, ODEC and NCEMC filed a complaint with FERC against
Virginia Power claiming that approximately $223 million in transmission costs related to specific projects were unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential and should be excluded from Virginia Power’s transmission
formula rate. ODEC and NCEMC requested that FERC estab-



lish procedures to determine the amount of costs for each applicable project that should be excluded from Virginia Power’s rates. In October 2010, FERC issued an order dismissing the
complaint in part and established hearings and settlement procedures on the remaining part of the complaint. While Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, it is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations.

In May 2008, the RPM Buyers filed a complaint with FERC claiming that PJM’s Reliability Pricing Model’s transitional
auctions have produced unjust and unreasonable capacity prices. The RPM Buyers requested that a refund effective date of June 1, 2008 be established and that FERC provide appropriate relief from unjust and unreasonable capacity charges within
15 months. In September 2008, FERC dismissed the complaint. The RPM Buyers requested rehearing of the FERC order in October 2008 and rehearing was denied in June 2009. A notice of appeal was filed in August 2009 by the Maryland Public Service
Commission and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In November 2009, the Court transferred the appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In February 2011, the Court
of Appeals denied the petition for review, concluding that FERC had adequately explained why the rates were just and reasonable.

EPACT included provisions to create an ERO. The ERO is required to promulgate mandatory reliability standards governing the operation of
the bulk power system in the U.S. FERC has certified NERC as the ERO and also issued an initial order approving many reliability standards that went into effect in 2007. Entities that violate standards will be subject to fines of between $1 thousand
and $1 million per day, and can also be assessed non-monetary penalties, depending upon the nature and severity of the violation.

Dominion and Virginia Power plan and operate their facilities in compliance with approved NERC reliability requirements. Dominion and Virginia Power employees participate on various NERC committees, track
the development and implementation of standards, and maintain proper compliance registration with NERC’s regional organizations. Dominion and Virginia Power anticipate incurring additional compliance expenditures over the next several years as
a result of the implementation of new cyber security programs as well as efforts to ensure appropriate facility ratings for Virginia Power’s transmission lines. In October 2010, NERC issued an industry alert identifying possible discrepancies
between the design and actual field conditions of transmission facilities as a potential reliability issue. The alert recommends that entities review their current facilities rating methodology to verify that the methodology is based on actual field
conditions, rather than solely on design documents, and to take corrective action if necessary. Virginia Power is evaluating its transmission facilities for any discrepancies between design and actual field conditions. In addition, NERC has
requested the industry to increase the number of assets subject to NERC reliability standards that are designated as critical assets, including cyber security assets. While Dominion and Virginia Power expect to incur additional compliance costs in
connection with the above NERC requirements and initiatives, such expenses are not expected to significantly affect results of operations.

Gas

FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy
Act of 1978, as amended. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over rates, terms and conditions of services performed by Dominion’s interstate natural gas company subsidiaries, including DTI, Cove Point and the Dominion South Pipeline
Company, LP. FERC also has jurisdiction over siting, construction and operation of natural gas import facilities and interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.

Dominion’s interstate gas transmission and storage activities are generally conducted on an open access basis, in accordance with certificates, tariffs and service agreements on file with FERC.

Dominion is also subject to the Pipeline Safety Act of 2002, which mandates inspections of interstate and intrastate natural
gas transmission and storage pipelines, particularly those located in areas of high-density population. Dominion has evaluated its natural gas transmission and storage properties, as required by the Department of Transportation regulations under
this Act, and has implemented a program of identification, testing and potential remediation activities. These activities are ongoing.

In May 2005, FERC approved a comprehensive rate settlement with DTI, its customers and interested state commissions. The settlement, which became effective July 1, 2005, revised DTI’s natural
gas transmission rates and reduced fuel retention levels for storage service customers. As part of the settlement, DTI and all signatory parties agreed to a rate moratorium through June 30, 2010. DTI remains subject to the terms of the tariff
rates established pursuant to the settlement.

In December 2007, DTI and the IOGA entered into a settlement agreement on
DTI’s gathering and processing rates, which DTI and IOGA agreed in May 2010 to extend through December 31, 2014. DTI, at its option, may elect to extend the agreement for an additional year through December 31, 2015. The settlement
extension maintains the gas retainage fee structure that DTI has had since 2001. The rates are 10.5% for gathering and 0.5% for processing. Under the settlement, DTI continues to retain all revenues from its liquids sales, thus maintaining cash flow
from the liquids business. DTI will file the negotiated rates associated with the agreement extension with FERC in December 2011.

Dominion is required to file a general base rate review for the FERC-jurisdictional services of Cove Point, effective no later than July 1, 2011. At that time, Cove Point’s cost of service will
be reviewed by the FERC, with rates set based on analyses of Cove Point’s costs and capital structure.

Environmental Regulations

Each of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operating segments faces substantial laws, regulations and compliance costs with respect to
environmental matters. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. If expenditures
for pollution control technologies and associated operating costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated rates (in regulated jurisdictions) or market prices (in deregulated jurisdictions), those costs could adversely affect future
results of operations and cash flows. The cost of complying with appli-



cable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the Companies. Dominion and Virginia Power have applied for or obtained the necessary environmental permits for the
operation of their facilities. Many of these permits are subject to reissuance and continuing review. For a discussion of significant aspects of these matters, including current and planned capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance
required to be discussed in this Item, see

General

In recent years there has
been increased national and international attention to GHG emissions and their relationship to climate change, which has resulted in federal, regional and state legislative or regulatory action in this area. Dominion and Virginia Power support
national climate change legislation to provide a consistent, economy-wide approach to addressing this issue and are taking action to protect the environment and address climate change while meeting the future needs of their growing service
territory. Dominion’s CEO and operating segment CEOs are responsible for compliance with the laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including climate change, and Dominion’s Board of Directors receives periodic updates on
these matters.

Dominion has developed a comprehensive GHG inventory for calendar year 2009. For Dominion
Generation, Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s direct
CO


equivalent emissions, based on equity share (ownership),
were approximately 54 million metric tonnes and 33 million metric tonnes, respectively, in 2009. For the DVP operating segment’s electric transmission and distribution operations, direct CO


equivalent emissions were approximately 0.2 million metric tonnes.
DTI’s (including Cove Point) direct CO


equivalent
emissions were approximately 2.5 million metric tonnes and East Ohio’s direct CO


equivalent emissions were approximately 1.4 million metric tonnes. While the Companies do not have final 2010 emissions data, they do not expect a significant variance in emissions from 2009
amounts. With respect to electric generation, primary facility stack emissions of CO


from carbon based fuel combustion are directly measured via continuous emissions monitor system methods set forth under 40 CFR Part 75 of the U.S. Electric Code of Federal Regulation. For those emission
sources not covered under 40 CFR Part 75, and for methane and nitrous oxide emissions, quantification is based on fuel combustion, higher heating values, emission factors, and global warming potentials as specified in the EPA’s Mandatory
Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule. For the DVP operating segment’s electric transmission and distribution emissions, the protocol used was

The Climate Registry

. For Dominion’s natural gas businesses, combustion related emissions
were calculated using the EPA Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule as described above. For DTI, the protocol used to calculate the non-combustion related emissions reported above was

developed by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America.

For East Ohio, the protocol used to calculate the non-combustion related emissions was the American Gas Association’s April 2008 Greenhouse Emissions Estimation Methodologies and Procedures

Dominion and Virginia Power’s Strategy for Voluntarily Reducing GHG Emissions

While Dominion
and Virginia Power have not established a standalone GHG emissions reduction target or timetable, they are actively engaged in voluntary reduction efforts and are working toward achieving the standards established by existing state regulations as
set forth above. The Companies have an integrated strategy for reducing GHG emission intensity that is based on maintaining a diverse fuel mix, including nuclear, coal, gas, hydro and renewable energy, investing in renewable energy projects and
promoting energy conservation and efficiency efforts. See

Environmental Strategy

above for a description of Dominion and Virginia Power’s strategy for reducing GHG emission intensity. Below are some of the Companies’ efforts that
have or are expected to reduce the Companies’ carbon emissions or intensity:

Ÿ

In 2003, Virginia Power retired two oil-fired units at its Possum Point power station, replacing them with a new 559 MW combined-cycle natural gas
unit. Virginia Power also converted two coal-fired units to cleaner burning natural gas.

Ÿ

Since 2000, Dominion has added over 2,600 MW of non-emitting nuclear generation and over 3,500 MW of new lower-emitting natural gas-fired
generation including nearly 1,600 MW at Virginia Power (excluding Possum Point), to its generation mix.

Ÿ

Virginia Power added 83 MW of renewable biomass.

Ÿ

Dominion has over 800 MW of wind energy in operation or development.

Ÿ

In June 2010, Virginia Power announced its plans to develop an integrated solar and battery storage demonstration project in Halifax County, Virginia.

Ÿ

Virginia Power is completing construction of the 580 MW combined-cycle natural gas-fired Bear Garden generating facility.

Ÿ

Virginia Power has announced its plans to develop the Warren County power station development project, which is designed to be a 3-on-1,
combined-cycle, natural gas-fired power station expected to generate more than 1,300 MW of electricity. In connection with the air permit process for the Warren County project, Virginia Power reached an agreement with the National Park Service to
permanently retire the North Branch power station, a 74 MW coal fired plant located in West Virginia, once the Warren County power station begins commercial operations.

Ÿ

Virginia Power and ODEC have received an Early Site Permit from the NRC for the possible addition of approximately 1,500 MW of nuclear generation in
Virginia. Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit.

Ÿ

In May 2010, Virginia Power launched five new DSM programs within the Virginia service territory and has sought the approval of the North Carolina
commission to launch six new



DSM programs in North Carolina in 2011, subject to required regulatory approvals.

Ÿ

Virginia Power has initiated a demonstration of smart grid technologies, which are designed to help reduce the electric energy consumption of Virginia
Power’s retail customers and therefore reduce generation requirements.

While, upon
entering service, Virginia Power’s new Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, which is currently under construction in southwest Virginia, will be a new source of GHG emissions, Virginia Power has taken steps to minimize the impact on the
environment. The new plant is expected to use at least 10% biomass for fuel and is designed to be carbon-capture compatible, meaning that technology to capture CO


can be added to the station when it becomes commercially available. Also, Virginia Power has announced plans to convert
its coal units at Bremo power station to natural gas, contingent upon the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center entering service and receipt of necessary approvals. It is currently estimated that the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center will have the
potential to emit about 4.8 million metric tonnes of direct CO


emissions in a year assuming a 100% capacity factor and 100% coal-fired operation. Actual emissions will depend on the capacity factor of the facility and the extent to which biomass is burned. See

Dominion Generation—Properties

for more information on the projects above, as well as other projects under current development.

Since 2000, the Companies have tracked the emissions of their electric generation fleet. Their electric generation fleet employs a mix of fuel and renewable energy sources. Comparing annual year 2000 to
annual year 2009, Dominion and Virginia Power’s electric generating fleet (based on ownership percentage) reduced their average CO


emissions rate per MWh of energy produced from electric generation by about 16% and 5%, respectively. During such time
period the capacity of Dominion and Virginia Power’s electric generation fleet has grown.

All aspects of the operation and maintenance of Dominion’s and Virginia Powers’ nuclear power stations, which are part of the Dominion
Generation segment, are regulated by the NRC. Operating licenses issued by the NRC are subject to revocation, suspension or modification, and the operation of a nuclear unit may be suspended if the NRC determines that the public interest, health or
safety so requires.

From time to time, the NRC adopts new requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear
facilities. In many cases, these new regulations require changes in the design, operation and maintenance of existing nuclear facilities. If the NRC adopts such requirements in the future, it could result in substantial increases in the cost of
operating and maintaining Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear generating units.

The NRC also requires Dominion
and Virginia Power to decontaminate their nuclear facilities once operations cease. This process is referred to as decommissioning, and the Companies are required by the NRC to be financially prepared. For information on decommissioning trusts, see

Under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Dominion and Virginia Power entered into contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent
nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin accepting the spent fuel on January 31, 1998, the date provided by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and by the Companies’ contracts with the DOE. In January 2004, Dominion and Virginia Power filed lawsuits
in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the DOE requesting damages in connection with its failure to commence accepting spent nuclear fuel. A trial occurred in May 2008 and post-trial briefing and argument concluded in July 2008. On
October 15, 2008, the Court issued an opinion and order for Dominion in the amount of approximately $155 million, which includes approximately $112 million in damages incurred by Virginia Power for spent fuel-related costs at its Surry and
North Anna power stations and approximately $43 million in damages incurred for spent nuclear fuel-related costs at Millstone through June 30, 2006. Judgment was entered by the Court on October 28, 2008. In December 2008, the
government appealed the judgment to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the appeal was docketed. In March 2009, the Federal Circuit granted the government’s request to stay the appeal. In May 2010, the stay was lifted, and
the government’s initial brief in the appeal was filed in June 2010. The issues raised by the government on appeal pertain to the damages awarded to Dominion for Millstone. The government did not take issue with the damages awarded to Virginia
Power for Surry or North Anna. As a result, Virginia Power recognized a receivable in the amount of $174 million, largely offset against property, plant and equipment and regulatory assets and liabilities, representing certain spent nuclear
fuel-related costs incurred through June 30, 2010. Briefing on the appeal was concluded in September 2010 and oral argument took place before the Federal Circuit in January 2011. Payment of any damages will not occur until the appeal process has
been resolved.

A lawsuit was also filed for Kewaunee. In August 2010, Dominion and the federal government reached a settlement
resolving Dominion’s claims for damages incurred at Kewaunee through December 31, 2008. The approximately $21 million settlement payment was received in September 2010.

The Companies will continue to manage their spent fuel until it is accepted by the DOE.

Virginia Power and Kewaunee continue to recognize receivables for certain spent nuclear fuel-related costs that they believe are probable
of recovery from the DOE.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond
their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see

Forward-Looking Statements

in Item 7. MD&A.

Dominion’s
and Virginia Power’s results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather.

Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, and affect



the price of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can be destructive, causing outages and property damage that require incurring additional
expenses. Additionally, droughts can result in reduced water levels that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies’ power stations. Furthermore, the Companies’ operations could be adversely affected and their physical
plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels
of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level.

Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to complex governmental regulation that could adversely affect their results of operations.

Dominion’s
and Virginia Power’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. They must also comply with environmental legislation and
associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that their business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. However, new laws or regulations, the revision or
reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial expense.

Dominion and Virginia Power could be subject to penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards.

As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of generation facilities and bulk electric transmission systems, including Dominion and Virginia Power, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enacted
by NERC and enforced by FERC. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject the Companies to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If either Dominion or Virginia Power is found not to be in
compliance with the mandatory reliability standards it could be subject to remediation costs, as well as sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance with future

environmental laws, including laws and regulations designed to address

global climate change, air quality, coal combustion by-products, cooling water and other matters could make certain of the Companies’ generation facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste
management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of pollution
control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency
as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and Dominion and Virginia Power expect that they will remain significant in the future.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable to
Domin-

ion or Virginia Power. The EPA is expected to issue additional regulations with respect to air quality under the CAA, including revised NAAQS, a replacement of the CAIR relating to NO

X

and SO


emissions, and a MACT rule for coal and oil-fired electric generation plants that will likely address numerous HAPs,
including mercury. Risks relating to potential regulation of GHG emissions are discussed below. Dominion and Virginia Power also expect additional federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures
and coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices.

Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the
inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations related to emissions. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the
difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if excessive, could make the Companies’ generation
facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.

If additional federal and/or state requirements are imposed on energy companies
mandating limitations on GHG emissions, such

requirements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combina

tion could make some of Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s electric gen

eration units uneconomical to maintain or operate.

The U.S. Congress, environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some state and federal
agencies are focusing considerable attention on GHG emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that federal legislation and/or additional EPA regulation, and possibly
additional state legislation and/or regulation, may pass resulting in the imposition of additional limitations on GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.

There are also potential impacts on Dominion’s natural gas businesses as federal GHG legislation and regulations
may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products. Several regions of the U.S. have
moved forward with GHG emission regulations including regions where Dominion has operations. For example, Massachusetts has implemented regulations requiring reductions in CO


emissions through RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO


emissions from power plants in the Northeast, which affects several of Dominion’s facilities.

Compliance with GHG emission reduction requirements may require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committing
significant capital toward carbon capture and storage technology, purchase of allowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities.
The cost of compliance with GHG emission legislation and/or regulation is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the implementation of rules, required levels of
reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon capture and storage technology



and associated regulations, and the selected compliance alternatives. As a result, the Companies cannot estimate the effect of any such legislation on their results of operations, financial
condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if excessive, could make the Companies’ generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominion’s or Virginia
Power’s results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.

The
base rates and rider rates of Virginia Power are subject to regulatory review.

As a result of the Regulation Act, in 2009 the Virginia Commission commenced its review of the base rates of
Virginia Power under a modified cost-of-service model. That review culminated in a final order in March 2010, in which the Commission ordered that Virginia Power’s base rates be frozen at their pre-September 1, 2009 levels until
December 1, 2013. In 2011, however, the Virginia Commission will commence biennial reviews of the rates and terms and conditions of Virginia Power and, in that first biennial review, may order a credit to customers for a portion of earnings
more than 50 basis points above the authorized ROE.

The rates of Virginia
Power’s electric transmission operations and Dominion’s gas transmission and distribution operations are subject to regulatory review.

Revenue provided by Virginia Power’s
electric transmission operations and Dominion’s gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by federal and state regulatory agencies. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability,
through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.

Virginia Power’s wholesale charges for electric transmission service are adjusted on an annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia
Power’s wholesale electric transmission cost of service is estimated and thereafter adjusted as appropriate to reflect actual costs allocated to Virginia Power by PJM. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment
in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Power’s wholesale revenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable.

Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominion’s gas transmission businesses are subject to review by FERC. Dominion is
required to file a general base rate review for the FERC-jurisdictional services of Cove Point, effective no later than July 31, 2011. At that time, Cove Point’s cost-of-service will be reviewed by the FERC, with rates set based on
analyses of Cove Point’s costs and capital structure.

Dominion’s gas distribution businesses are subject to state
regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

Risks arising from
the reliability of electric generation, transmission and distribution equipment could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs.

Operation of the Companies’ generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves risk, including, the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, due to aging
infrastructure, fuel supply or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and
labor, operational restrictions

resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt
generation, transmission and distribution facilities. Because Virginia Power’s transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of its facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable
events occurring on the systems of such third parties.

Operation of the Companies’ generation facilities below expected
capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of generating units and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time
and are an inherent risk of the Companies’ business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies’ operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less energy or may require the Companies to
incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement energy and capacity from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to
perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result.

Dominion’s merchant power business is operating in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future
growth.

The success of Dominion’s merchant power business
depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to purchase and sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as
well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.

In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next
unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for
electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does not
enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise hedge its output, then these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.

Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtained
through short-term contracts or on the spot market. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominion’s financial
results.

Dominion’s merchant power business may be negatively affected
by possible FERC actions that could weaken competition in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules in the RTO markets.

Dominion’s merchant generation stations operating in PJM,
MISO and ISO-NE sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale
elec-



tricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these merchant generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly
functioning competitive wholesale markets in PJM, MISO and ISO-NE depend upon FERC’s continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize PJM, MISO and ISO-NE to make changes in market design.
FERC also periodically reviews Dominion’s authority to sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or Dominion’s authority to sell power at market-based rates could adversely impact the
future results of its merchant power business.

War, acts and threats of
terrorism, natural disaster and other significant events could adversely affect Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s

operations.

We cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on our business in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained
military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, infrastructure facilities, such as electric generation, electric and gas transmission
and distribution facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Furthermore, the physical or cyber security compromise of our facilities, could adversely affect our ability to manage these facilities effectively.
Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy, and the increased cost of insurance coverage, any of
which could negatively impact the Companies’ results of operations and financial condition.

There are risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities.

Dominion and Virginia Power operate nuclear facilities that are subject to
risks, including their ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, the disposal of which is subject to complex federal and state regulatory constraints. These risks also include the cost of and ability to maintain adequate reserves for
decommissioning, costs of replacement power, costs of plant maintenance and exposure to potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities. Decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage are maintained to mitigate the
financial exposure to these risks. However, it is possible that decommissioning costs could exceed the amount in the trusts or that costs arising from claims could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage.

The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity
constraints.

Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity and financial market risks. In addition,
Dominion purchases and sells commodity-based contracts primarily in the natural gas market for trading purposes. The Companies could recognize financial losses on these contracts, including as a result of volatility in the market values of the
underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these contracts involves management’s judgment or use
of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.

The use of derivatives to hedge future sales may limit the benefit Dominion would otherwise
receive from increases in commodity prices. These hedge arrangements generally include collateral requirements that require Dominion to deposit funds or post letters of credit with counterparties to cover the fair value of covered contracts in
excess of agreed upon credit limits. For instance, when commodity prices rise to levels substantially higher than the levels where it has hedged future sales, Dominion may be required to use a material portion of its available liquidity or obtain
additional liquidity to cover these collateral requirements. In some circumstances, this could have a compounding effect on Dominion’s financial liquidity and results of operations.

Derivatives designated under hedge accounting, to the extent not fully offset by the hedged transaction, can result in ineffectiveness
losses. These losses primarily result from differences between the location and/or specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item and could adversely affect Dominion’s results of operations.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operations in regards to these transactions are subject to multiple market risks including
market liquidity, counterparty credit strength and price volatility. These market risks are beyond the Companies’ control and could adversely affect their results of operations and future growth.

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted into law in July 2010, includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter
derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivatives-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the clearing, exchange trading
and capital and margin requirements, will be established through the CFTC’s rulemaking process, which is required to be completed by July 2011. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s derivative
activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs for their derivative activities, including from higher margin requirements. In addition, implementation of, and
compliance with, the over-the-counter derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies’ swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies’ derivative activities.

Dominion and Virginia Power may not complete plant construction or expansion projects
that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed.

Several plant construction and expansion projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. Management anticipates that they will be required to seek additional
financing in the future to fund current and future plant construction and expansion projects and may not be able to secure such financing on favorable terms. In addition, projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weather
conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of their counterparties or vendors,
or other factors beyond their control. Even if plant construction and expansion projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of Dominion and Virginia Power following the
projects may



not meet expectations. Additionally, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Further, Dominion and Virginia Power may
not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect their ability to
realize the anticipated benefits from the plant construction and expansion projects.

Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results of operations.

Dominion and Virginia Power are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including
but not limited to payment for services. Such defaults by customers, suppliers or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results.

Energy conservation could negatively impact Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s financial results.

Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Additionally, technological advances driven by
federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices, including lighting and electric heat pumps, could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. To the extent conservation resulted in reduced energy demand or
significantly slowed the growth in demand, the value of the Companies’ business activities could be adversely impacted.

An inability to access financial markets could adversely affect the execution of
Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s business plans.

Dominion and Virginia Power rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of
funding and liquidity for capital expenditures, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies’ creditworthiness, as evaluated by
credit rating agencies or otherwise, or market reputation, or general financial market disruptions outside of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more
financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, or the failure of financial
institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies’ ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of decommissioning trust
funds and benefit plan assets or increase Dominion’s liabilities, which then could require significant additional funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the value of
the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominion’s nuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant
assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations
to decommission Dominion’s

nuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Dominion’s pension and other postretirement
benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase
the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations, Dominion’s results of
operations and financial condition could be negatively affected.

Changing
rating agency requirements could negatively affect Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s growth and business strategy.

In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed
credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, Dominion and Virginia Power may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A
reduction in Dominion’s credit ratings or the credit ratings of Virginia Power could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require Dominion to
post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.

Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s financial results.

Dominion and Virginia
Power cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the
way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect reported earnings or could increase reported liabilities.

Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and
technical employees could have an adverse effect on Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operations.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s business strategy is dependent on their
ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results.

million after-tax charge primarily reflecting severance pay and other benefits related to a workforce reduction program, as discussed in Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. Also in 2010, Dominion recorded $127
million of after-tax impairment charges at certain merchant generation facilities, as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The loss from discontinued operations in 2010 includes a $140 million after-tax loss on the sale of
Peoples.

2009 results include a $435 million after-tax charge in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009
base rate case proceedings discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also in 2009, Dominion recorded a $281 million after-tax ceiling test impairment charge related to the carrying value of its E&P properties.

2008 results include $109 million of after-tax charges reflecting other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain securities
held as investments in nuclear decommissioning trusts. In addition, income from discontinued operations in 2008 includes a $120 million after-tax benefit due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with the sale of Peoples.

2007 results include a $1.5 billion after-tax benefit from the disposition of Dominion’s non-Appalachian E&P
operations and a $252 million after-tax impairment charge associated with the sale of Dresden. Also in 2007, Dominion recorded a $137 million after-tax charge resulting from the termination of the long-term power sales agreement associated with
State Line. In addition, the reapplication of accounting guidance for cost-based rate regulation to the Virginia jurisdiction of Virginia Power’s generation operations in 2007 resulted in a $158 million after-tax extraordinary charge.

2006 reflects the net impact of the discontinued operations of Peoples sold in 2010, Canadian E&P operations sold in June
2007 and the Peaker facilities sold in March 2007. Discontinued operations for Peoples includes a $119 million after-tax charge primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities, as well as a $114 million after-tax charge resulting from
the write-off of certain regulatory assets, both in connection with the sale. Discontinued operations for the Peaker facilities includes a $164 million after-tax impairment charge to reduce the facilities’ carrying amounts to their estimated
fair values less cost to sell.

Virginia Power

results include a $123 million after-tax charge primarily reflecting severance pay and other benefits related to a workforce reduction program, discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

2009 results include a $427 million after-tax charge in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case
proceedings discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

2007 results reflect the reapplication of
accounting guidance for cost-based rate regulation to the Virginia jurisdiction of Virginia Power’s generation operations, which resulted in a $158 million after-tax extraordinary charge.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Dominion and Virginia Power have identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of
the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to their financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using
different assumptions. Dominion and Virginia Power have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of their Board of Directors. Virginia Power’s Board of Directors also serves as its
Audit Committee.

PERATIONS

The accounting for Virginia Power’s regulated electric and Dominion’s regulated gas operations differs from the accounting for
nonregulated operations in that they are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that
assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs
are deferred as regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is
collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.

The Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future rates is probable and make various assumptions in
their analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of a regulatory asset is
determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. The Companies currently believe the recovery of their regulatory assets is probable. See Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

BLIGATIONS

Dominion and Virginia Power recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and
are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, the Companies estimate the fair value of their AROs using present value techniques, in which they make various assumptions including
estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. AROs currently reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were measured during a period of
historically low interest rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When the Companies revise any assumptions used to calculate the fair
value of existing AROs, they adjust the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset. The Companies accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, Dominion recognized $85 million, $89 million and $94 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize
$81 million in 2011. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, Virginia Power recognized $35 million, $35 million and $38 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $37 million in 2011. Virginia Power records accretion and depreciation
associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs as an adjustment to its regulatory liability for nuclear decommissioning.

A significant portion of the Companies’ AROs relates to the future decommissioning of Dominion’s merchant and Virginia

Power’s utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December 31, 2010, Dominion’s nuclear
decommissioning AROs totaled $1.4 billion, representing approximately 87% of its total AROs. At December 31, 2010, Virginia Power’s nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $620 million, representing approximately 92% of its total AROs.
Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with the Companies’ nuclear decommissioning obligations.

The Companies obtain from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and
timing of planned decommissioning activities for their nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature
highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, the Companies’ cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on
subjective factors which are considered to be a critical assumption.

The Companies determine cost escalation rates, which
represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. As a result of the updated decommissioning cost studies and applicable escalation
rates obtained in 2009, Dominion recorded a decrease of $309 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs of its units, including a $103 million ($62 million after-tax) reduction in other operations and maintenance expense due to a downward revision
in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a power station unit that is no longer in service. Virginia Power recorded a decrease of $119 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units.

AXES

Judgment and the use of estimates are required
in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax
matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.

Given the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to
be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be
examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2010, Dominion had $307 million and Virginia Power had $117 million of unrecognized tax benefits. For a substantial amount of these unrecognized
tax benefits, the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the
bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion and Virginia Power evaluate
quar-



terly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to
realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. The Companies establish a valuation allowance when it is
more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2010, Dominion had established $68 million of valuation allowances and Virginia Power had no valuation allowances.

Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative contracts
such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage commodity and financial market risks of their business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting
requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear decommissioning and
Dominion’s rabbi and benefit plan trust funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 7 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.

Fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks
indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, the Companies consider whether the broker is willing and able
to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources
is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases the Companies must estimate prices based on available
historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect their market assumptions.

The Companies maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

As of December 31, 2010, Dominion reported $3.1 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the
acquisition of the former CNG in 2000.

In April of each year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and
performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2010, 2009 and 2008 annual tests and any
interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.

In general, Dominion estimates the fair value of
its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving

peer group companies. For Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations, Peoples and Hope and certain DCI operations, negotiated sales prices were used as fair value for the tests conducted in
2010, 2009 and 2008. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion’s estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent
transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion’s estimates of future cash flows, could result in a
future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on
relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting
fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Impairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible
assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset’s carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to
the extent that the asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and
grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to
reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of
future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including
future production and sales levels, and expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets.

Dominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing
benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

obligations and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these
factors, as well as differences between Dominion’s assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost trend rates are critical
assumptions. Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:

Ÿ

Historical return analysis to determine expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations;

Ÿ

Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indices;

Ÿ

Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; and

Ÿ

Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion’s pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity,
33% fixed income, 3% real estate and 18% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments.

Strategic investment policies are established for each of Dominion’s prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability
studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. Deviations from the plans’ strategic allocation are a function of Dominion’s assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans’
actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target.

Dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of other independent investment advisors to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion
calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2010, 2009 and 2008. Dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
assumption of 7.75% for 2010, 2009 and 2008. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held
as plan assets.

Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected
payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost were 6.60% in 2010 and 2009, compared to 6.60% and 6.50%, respectively, in 2008. Dominion selected a discount rate of 5.90%
for determining its December 31, 2010 projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

Dominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various
factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion’s healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2010 is 7.0% and is
expected to gradually decrease to 4.60% by 2060 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.

The following table
illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant:

In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2010, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion’s projected pension benefit obligation by $138 million and its accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by $52 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $217 million. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

EVENUE

Virginia Power recognizes and records revenues when energy is delivered to the customer. The determination of sales to individual
customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, the amounts of electric energy delivered to customers, but not yet billed, is estimated and recorded as
unbilled revenue. This estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings. Virginia Power’s customer receivables included $397 million and $355 million of accrued unbilled revenue at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The calculation of unbilled revenues is complex and includes numerous
estimates and assumptions including historical usage, applicable customer rates, weather factors and total daily electric generation supplied, adjusted for line losses. Changes in generation patterns, customer usage patterns and other factors, which
are the basis for the estimates of unbilled revenues, could have a significant effect on the calculation and therefore on Virginia Power’s results of operations and financial condition.

Net income attributable to Dominion increased by 118%. Favorable drivers include a gain on the sale of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations, lower ceiling test impairment charges related to
these properties, the absence of a charge in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case proceedings and the impact of favorable weather on electric utility operations. Unfavorable drivers include charges related to a
workforce reduction program, a loss on the sale of Peoples, lower margins from merchant generation operations and impairment charges related to certain merchant generation facilities.


VS

. 2008

Net income attributable to Dominion decreased by 30%.
Unfavorable drivers include an impairment charge related to the carrying value of Dominion’s E&P properties due to declines in gas and oil prices during the first quarter of 2009 and a charge in connection with the settlement of Virginia
Power’s 2009 base rate case proceedings. Favorable drivers include higher margins in Dominion’s merchant generation operations and a higher contribution from Dominion’s gas transmission operations due to the completion of the Cove
Point expansion project.

Analysis of Consolidated Operations

Presented below are selected amounts related to Dominion’s results of operations:

An analysis of Dominion’s results of operations follows:


VS

. 2009

Net Revenue

increased 8%,
primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

A $1.1 billion increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

The absence of a charge for the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case proceedings ($570 million);

Ÿ

The impact of Riders C1 and C2, R, S and T ($279 million);

Ÿ

An increase in sales to retail customers primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days ($248 million); and

Ÿ

An increase in ancillary revenues received from PJM ($78 million), primarily reflecting an increase in the scheduled dispatch of gas and oil-fired
generation units to meet higher demand; partially offset by

Ÿ

A decrease primarily due to the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($75 million);

Ÿ

A $98 million increase from regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily reflecting increased rider revenue associated with the recovery of
bad debt expense ($60 million) and an increase in base rates ($40 million); and

Ÿ

A $46 million increase related to natural gas transmission operations largely due to the completion of the Cove Point expansion project.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

A $356 million decrease from merchant generation operations due to a decrease at certain nuclear generating facilities ($237 million) primarily due to
lower realized prices, a decline in margins at certain fossil generation facilities ($70 million)



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

primarily due to an increase in fuel prices and the expiration of certain requirements-based power sales contracts in December 2009 ($49 million);

Ÿ

A $222 million decrease reflecting the sale of substantially all of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010; and

Ÿ

A $40 million decrease in producer services primarily related to unfavorable price changes on economic hedging positions and lower physical margins,
all associated with natural gas aggregation, marketing and trading activities.

Other operations and maintenance

increased $12 million primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

A $240 million net increase in salaries, wages and benefits primarily related to a workforce reduction program. As a result of the program, Dominion
expects to avoid future annualized operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $100 million that would have otherwise been incurred;

Ÿ

Impairment charges related to certain merchant generating facilities ($194 million);

Ÿ

A $103 million increase due to the absence of a benefit in 2009 from a downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a unit that is no
longer in service;

Ÿ

A $56 million increase in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily related to low income assistance programs ($60
million). These expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income; and

Ÿ

A $42 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

A $434 million decrease in ceiling test impairment charges related to the carrying value of Dominion’s E&P properties;

Ÿ

The absence of a $142 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case
proceedings; and

Ÿ

A $48 million decrease in outage costs due to a decrease in scheduled outage days primarily at certain merchant generation facilities.

DD&A

decreased 7%, primarily due to the sale of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations ($45 million) and lower amortization due to decreased cost of emissions allowances consumed ($37 million).

Other taxes

increased 10%, primarily due to additional property tax from increased investments and higher rates ($16 million), an increase in gross receipts tax due to new non-regulated retail energy
customers ($14 million) and higher payroll taxes associated with a workforce reduction program ($12 million).

Gain on sale of Appalachian E&P operations

reflects a gain on the sale of these operations, as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Other income

decreased 13%, primarily reflecting an increase in charitable contributions ($46 million) and a decrease in interest income ($15 million); partially offset by the absence of an impairment loss on an
equity method investment ($30 million) and higher realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($12 million).

Interest and related charges

decreased 6%, primarily due to a benefit resulting from the net effect of the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain interest rate hedges and subsequent changes in fair value of these interest
rate derivatives ($73 million), partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the June 2009 hybrid issuance ($26 million).

Income tax expense

increased $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher federal and state
taxes largely due to the gain on the sale of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P business.

Loss from discontinued operations

primarily reflects a loss on the sale of Peoples.


VS

. 2008

Net
Revenue

decreased 5%, primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

A $614 million decrease in net revenue from electric utility operations primarily due to a charge for the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009 base
rate case proceedings;

Ÿ

An $86 million decrease in sales of gas production from E&P operations primarily reflecting the expiration of VPP royalty interests; and

Ÿ

A $21 million decrease in net gas revenue from retail energy marketing operations primarily due to lower prices ($39 million), partially offset by
higher volumes ($18 million).

These decreases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

A $161 million increase from merchant generation operations, primarily reflecting lower fuel expenses due to the impact of lower commodity prices ($190
million) and higher sales volumes primarily from fewer scheduled nuclear refueling outages and higher demand for natural gas generation ($143 million), partially offset by lower sales prices ($79 million) and increased fuel consumption ($93 million)
at certain fossil generation facilities;

Ÿ

A $158 million increase related to gas transmission operations largely due to the completion of the Cove Point expansion project; and

Ÿ

A $70 million increase in net electric revenue from retail energy marketing operations primarily attributable to higher volumes ($36 million) and the
acquisition of a retail energy marketing business in September 2008 ($34 million).

A $455 million ceiling test impairment charge related to the carrying value of E&P properties due to declines in natural gas and oil prices;

Ÿ

A $142 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case proceedings;
and

Ÿ

A $74 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits largely due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

A $103 million downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a power station unit that is no longer in service;

Ÿ

The absence of a $59 million charge related to the impairment of a DCI investment sold in 2008; and

Ÿ

A $29 million decrease largely due to the deferral of electric transmission-related expenditures collectible under certain rate adjustment clauses.



DD&A

increased 10%, principally due to higher depreciation from property additions ($100 million) and higher amortization due to increased consumption of emissions allowances ($37 million), partially offset
by decreased DD&A reflecting lower gas and oil production ($19 million) and a decrease in DD&A rates ($28 million) at Dominion’s E&P properties.

Other income (loss)

increased $236 million primarily due to the impact of net realized
gains (including investment income) on merchant nuclear decommissioning trust funds in 2009 as compared to net realized losses (net of investment income) in 2008.

Interest and related charges

increased 7%, primarily due to the impact of additional
borrowings ($34 million) and the absence of a $23 million benefit related to the redemption of Virginia Power’s Callable and Puttable Enhanced Securities in 2008.

Income tax expense

decreased by 37%, primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income in 2009.

Outlook

In order to deliver favorable
returns to investors, Dominion’s strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide earnings per share growth, a
growing dividend and a stable credit profile. Dominion’s 2010 results were positively impacted by the gain on the sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations. In 2011, Dominion’s operating businesses will likely
experience a decrease in net income on a per share basis as compared to 2010. Dominion’s anticipated 2011 results reflect the following significant factors:

Ÿ

Lower realized margins from its merchant generation operations due to lower commodity prices and an increase in planned outages at certain nuclear and
fossil facilities;

Ÿ

A return to normal weather in its electric utility operations; and

Ÿ

The absence of earnings from Appalachian E&P operations sold in April 2010; partially offset by

Ÿ

Growth in electric sales resulting from the recovering economy;

Ÿ

A benefit from rate adjustment clause revenue associated with Bear Garden and Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center;

Ÿ

A reduction in certain operations and maintenance expenses resulting largely from the implementation of cost-containment measures, including the
workforce reduction program discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and

Ÿ

Lower outage costs at certain electric utility generating facilities.

Dominion also expects the bonus depreciation provisions of the tax legislation recently enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2010, discussed in
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to reduce income taxes otherwise payable by $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion during 2011 through 2013. The acceleration of these tax deductions is expected to reduce the domestic production activities
income tax deduction through 2012 and will also increase deferred taxes, thereby reducing rate base for regulated operations. However, Dominion plans to partially mitigate the earnings per share impact of these items by using the cash tax savings to

repurchase common stock in 2011 and reduce the amount of debt that would have otherwise been issued over the next three years. In addition, Dominion does not plan any market issuances of common
stock in 2011 or 2012.

Dominion expects its operating businesses to provide five percent to six percent growth in net income
on a per share basis in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to its assumptions regarding construction and operation of new infrastructure in its utility operations, fewer merchant outages and an anticipated rise in commodity prices and energy
demand.

ESOURCES

Dominion and Virginia Power depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital requirements.
Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities.

At December 31, 2010, Dominion had $2 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities, including $559 million of unused
capacity under joint credit facilities available to Virginia Power. See additional discussion under

Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt

.

A summary of Dominion’s cash flows is presented below:

(1)

2009 and 2008 amounts include $2 million and $5 million, respectively, of cash classified as held for sale in Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

A summary of Virginia Power’s cash flows is presented below:

Operating Cash
Flows

In 2010, net cash provided by Dominion’s operating activities decreased by approximately $2 billion, primarily due to lower
deferred fuel and gas cost recoveries, contributions to Dominion’s pension plans, the absence of disposed Appalachian E&P operations, lower merchant generation margins and refunds related to the 2009 Virginia Power base rate case
settlement, partially offset

by lower income tax payments, lower margin collateral requirements and the favorable impact of weather and rate adjustment clauses on electric utility operations.

In 2010, net cash provided by Virginia Power’s operating activities decreased by $561 million, primarily due to lower deferred fuel
cost recoveries in its Virginia jurisdiction, refunds related to the 2009 Virginia base rate case settlement, and contributions to Dominion’s pension plans; partially offset by the favorable impact of weather and rate adjustment clauses, and
cash received for income tax benefits in 2010, as compared to income taxes paid in 2009.

Dominion’s lower income
tax payments and Virginia Power’s realization of income tax benefits in 2010 resulted in part from the bonus depreciation provisions of the tax legislation recently enacted by the U.S. Congress, discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Dominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of
capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In 2011, Dominion’s board of directors adopted a new dividend policy that raised its target payout ratio. The Board established an annual dividend rate of $1.97 per share
of common stock, a 7.7% increase over the 2010 rate. Quarterly dividends are subject to declaration by the Board. Virginia Power believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital
expenditures and provide dividends to Dominion.

The Companies’ operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Dominion’s exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and
price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion’s credit exposure as of December 31, 2010 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any
unrealized on or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.

(1)

Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. The five largest counterparty
exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 33% of the total net credit exposure.

(2)

The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 1% of the total net credit exposure.

(3)

The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 11% of the total net credit exposure.

(4)

The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 8% of the total net credit exposure.



Virginia Power’s exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily
from sales to wholesale customers and is not considered material at December 31, 2010.

Investing Cash Flows

In 2010, net cash provided by Dominion’s investing activities was $419 million as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.7 billion
in 2009. This change is primarily due to the proceeds received from the sale of substantially all of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010 and the sale of Peoples in February 2010. While taxes and other costs of the sales are
reflected in cash flow from operations, the gross proceeds from the sales are reported in cash flow from investing activities.

In 2010, net cash used in Virginia Power’s investing activities decreased by $143 million, primarily due to lower capital
expenditures, partially offset by an increase in restricted cash equivalents designated to finance certain qualifying facilities.

Financing Cash
Flows and Liquidity

Dominion and Virginia Power rely on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not
satisfied by cash provided by their operations. As discussed in

Credit Ratings

, the Companies’ ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of
external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances and, in the case of Virginia Power, approval by the Virginia Commission.

Each of the Companies currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration,
communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows the Companies to use automatic shelf
registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for business combination transactions.

In
2010, net cash used in Dominion’s financing activities increased by $2.1 billion, primarily due to net debt repayments in 2010 as compared to net debt issuances in 2009, and net repurchases of common stock in 2010 as compared to issuances of
common stock in 2009. This reflects the use of proceeds from the sales of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations and Peoples.

In 2010, net cash provided by Virginia Power’s financing activities increased by $412 million, primarily due to higher net debt issuances in 2010 as compared to 2009, as a result of lower cash flow
from operations.

Dominion and Virginia Power use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt
financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to
fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion’s credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties. Dominion and Virginia Power replaced certain of their existing
credit facilities in September 2010, as noted below.

In connection with commodity hedging activities, the Companies are required to provide
collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, the Companies may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security.
From time to time, the Companies vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and
short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which the Companies can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall
liquidity management objectives.

Power borrowed $105 million in connection with the Industrial Development Authority of Wise County Solid Waste and Sewage Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 A, which mature in 2040 and bear a coupon rate of 2.375% for the first five years, after
which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time, using a remarketing process. The proceeds will be used to finance certain qualifying facilities at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center.

In December 2010 and September 2009, Virginia Power borrowed $100 million and $60 million, respectively, in connection with the $160
million Industrial Development Authority of Wise County Solid Waste and Sewage Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2009 A, which mature in 2040 and bear interest during the initial period at a variable rate. Due to unfavorable market conditions, Virginia
Power acquired the bonds upon issuance with the intention of remarketing them to third parties at a later time. The proceeds will be used to finance certain qualifying facilities at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. At December 31, 2010,
these bonds had not been remarketed and thus are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In December 2010, Virginia
Power borrowed $100 million in connection with the Industrial Development Authority of Halifax County, Virginia Recovery Zone Facility Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 A, which mature in 2041 and bear interest at a variable rate for the first seven years,
after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time, using a remarketing process. The proceeds will be used to finance certain qualifying facilities in Halifax County and/or Wise County.

December 31, 2010.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion and Virginia Power believe that their current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related
to Dominion and Virginia Power may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s credit ratings may affect their liquidity, cost of borrowing
under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which they are able to offer their debt securities.



Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating
characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company’s credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion and Virginia Power are most affected by each company’s financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating
agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.

In January 2010, Fitch lowered its credit
ratings for Virginia Power’s preferred stock and Dominion’s junior subordinated debt securities and enhanced junior subordinated notes solely due to a revision in Fitch’s ratings methodology such that it now rates these securities two
notches below its credit rating for senior unsecured debt securities. In December 2010, Moody’s raised its credit ratings for Virginia Power, reflecting sustained improvements in Virginia Power’s financial performance as measured by its
credit metrics and the agency’s views of a generally supportive regulatory and political environment in Virginia Power’s service territory.

Credit ratings as of February 23, 2011 follow:

As of February 23, 2011, Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s maintained a stable outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion and Virginia Power.

A downgrade in an individual company’s credit rating would not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term
financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it would likely increase the cost of borrowing. Dominion and Virginia Power work closely with Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s with the objective of
maintaining their current credit ratings. In order to maintain current ratings, the Companies may find it necessary to modify their business plans and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS.

Debt Covenants

As part of borrowing funds and
issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion and Virginia Power must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal
and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of
such requirements is agreed to by the

lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion and Virginia Power.

Some of the typical covenants include:

Ÿ

The timely payment of principal and interest;

Ÿ

Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC and information about changes in Dominion’s and Virginia
Power’s credit ratings to lenders;

Ÿ

Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or
consolidation, and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets;

Ÿ

Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and

Ÿ

Limitations on liens.

Dominion and Virginia Power are required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain their credit facilities. In addition, their credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect
their ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions.

As of December 31, 2010, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as
follows:

Company

Maximum Allowed Ratio

Actual 
Ratio

(1)

Dominion


%


%

Virginia Power


%


%

(1)

Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes junior subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

These provisions apply separately to Dominion and Virginia Power. If Dominion or Virginia
Power or any of either company’s material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require that company to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the
credit facility and the lenders could terminate their commitment to lend funds to that company. Accordingly, any default by Dominion will not affect the lenders’ commitment to Virginia Power. However, any default by Virginia Power would affect
the lenders’ commitment to Dominion under the joint credit agreements.

Dominion executed RCCs in connection with its
issuance of the following hybrid securities:

Ÿ

June 2006 hybrids;

Ÿ

September 2006 hybrids; and

Ÿ

June 2009 hybrids.

Under the terms of the RCCs, Dominion covenants to and for the benefit of designated covered debtholders, as may be designated from time to time, that Dominion shall not redeem, repurchase, or defease all
or any part of the hybrids, and shall not cause its majority owned subsidiaries to purchase all or any part of the hybrids, on or before their applicable RCC termination date, unless, subject to certain limitations, during the 180 days prior to such
activity, Dominion has received a specified amount of proceeds as set forth in the RCCs from the sale of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than the applicable characteristics of the
hybrids



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

at that time, as more fully described in the RCCs. The proceeds Dominion receives from the replacement offering, adjusted by a predetermined factor, must equal or exceed the redemption or
repurchase price.

Dominion’s hybrids are as follows:

Automatically extended, as set forth in the RCC, for additional quarterly periods, to the extent the maturity date is extended.

Dominion and Virginia Power monitor the debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of
December 31, 2010, there have been no events of default under or changes to Dominion’s debt covenants.

Dividend Restrictions

The Virginia Commission may prohibit any public service company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a dividend to an
affiliate if found to be detrimental to the public interest. At December 31, 2010, the Virginia Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by Virginia Power.

Certain agreements associated with Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt
to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion or Virginia Power’s ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from their subsidiaries at December 31, 2010.

See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion in
connection with the deferral of interest payments on junior subordinated notes.

XPENDITURES

Dominion’s
planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $3.9 billion, $4.7 billion and $4.4 billion in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Dominion’s expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation
and natural gas transmission and storage facilities, environmental upgrades, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets and purchases of nuclear fuel.

Virginia Power’s planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $2.2 billion, $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion in
2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Virginia Power’s expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation facilities, environmental upgrades, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and
distribution assets and purchases of nuclear fuel.

Dominion and Virginia Power expect to fund their capital expenditures with
cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors.

Based on available generation capacity and current estimates of growth in customer demand, Virginia Power will need additional generation
in the future. See

Dominion Generation-Properties

in Item 1. Business for a discussion of Virginia Power’s expansion plans.

These estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. The Companies may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital
expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.

Dominion
primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the provisions of FASB guidance that dictate a guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees,
including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others

At December 31, 2010, Dominion had issued $131
million of guarantees, primarily to support equity method investees. No significant amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded. As of December 31, 2010, Dominion’s exposure under these guarantees was $54 million, primarily
related to certain reserve requirements associated with non-recourse financing.

RRANGEMENT

Dominion leases Fairless in Pennsylvania, which began commercial operations in June 2004. During construction, Dominion

acted as the construction agent for the lessor, controlled the design and construction of the facility and has since been reimbursed for all project costs ($898 million) advanced to the lessor.
Dominion makes annual lease payments of $53 million. The lease expires in 2013 and at that time, Dominion may renew the lease at negotiated amounts based on original project costs and current market conditions, subject to lessor approval; purchase
Fairless at its original construction cost plus 51% of any appraised value in excess of original construction cost; or sell Fairless, on behalf of the lessor, to an independent third party. If Fairless is sold and the proceeds from the sale are less
than its original construction cost, Dominion would be required to make a payment to the lessor in an amount up to 70.75% of original project costs adjusted for certain other costs as specified in the lease. The lease agreement does not contain any
provisions that involve credit rating or stock price trigger events.

Benefits of this arrangement include:

Ÿ

Certain tax benefits as Dominion is considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes. As a result, Dominion is entitled to tax deductions
for depreciation not recognized for financial accounting purposes; and

Ÿ

As an operating lease for financial accounting purposes, the asset and related borrowings used to finance the construction of the asset are not
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although this improves measures of leverage calculated using amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, credit rating agencies view lease obligations as debt equivalents in evaluating
Dominion’s credit profile.

EGULATIONS

There have already been federal and state legislative proposals and regulatory action regarding the regulation of GHG emissions.
Dominion and Virginia Power expect that there may be federal legislation and/or regulatory action regarding compliance with more stringent air emission standards, regarding coal combustion by-products, and regarding regulation of cooling water
intake structures and discharges in the future. With respect to GHG emissions, in December 2010, the EPA announced a schedule for when they will propose regulations which would establish GHG performance standards for new, modified and existing
fossil-fired electric generating units. Regulations are expected to be proposed by July 2011 and finalized by May 2012.

This means that Dominion’s new, modified, and existing fossil-fired electric generating units will become
subject to GHG performance standards, if these rules are finalized. The EPA has not provided any detail yet on what the performance standard might be or what measures facilities might have to make to reach the standard. With respect to emission
reductions of SO


, NO

x

, mercury and HAPs (in addition to mercury), specific requirements will
depend on the following:

Ÿ

Final outcome of the EPA’s scheduled rulemaking for developing MACT standards for mercury and other HAPs to replace the CAMR vacated by a federal
court in 2008;

Ÿ

The final outcome of the EPA’s Transport Rule proposed in July 2010 in response to a federal court remand of the CAIR as well as future state
regulations implementing requirements to address the EPA’s promulgation of revised NAAQS for SO


and NO

2;

and

Ÿ

EPA’s impending rulemaking to revise the ozone NAAQS.

With respect to cooling water intakes and discharges, the Companies expect future federal regulation on cooling water intake structures and the quality of water discharges, and more focus by the EPA and
state regulatory authorities on thermal discharge issues. With respect to coal combustion by-products, Dominion and Virginia Power expect federal regulation of coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices. If any of these new proposals
are adopted, additional significant expenditures may be required.

Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives,
or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can be exempted from these clearing
and exchange trading requirements. In
addi-

tion, the Dodd-Frank Act allows the CFTC and SEC to impose initial and variation margin requirements on entities who execute swaps. End users were not expressly exempt from these requirements for
non-cleared swaps; however, key legislators indicated in a public letter that it was their intention to exclude commercial hedging transactions by end users from these requirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions
of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the clearing, exchange trading and margin requirements, will be established through the CFTC’s and SEC’s rulemaking process, which is required to be completed by July 2011. If, as a result of the rulemaking
process, Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs for their derivative activities, including from
higher margin requirements. In addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the over-the-counter derivative provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies’ swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the
Companies’ derivative activities. Due to the ongoing rulemaking process, the Companies are currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act’s derivative-related provisions on their financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

ANAGEMENT

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s financial instruments, commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to potential
losses due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity security prices as described below. Commodity price risk is present in Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s electric operations, Dominion’s gas procurement
operations, and Dominion’s energy marketing and trading operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for electricity, natural gas and other commodities. The Companies use commodity derivative contracts to manage
price risk exposures for these operations. Interest rate risk is generally related to their outstanding debt. In addition, they are exposed to investment price risk through various portfolios of equity and debt securities.

The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments
over a selected time period due to a 10% unfavorable change in commodity prices or interest rates.

Commodity Price Risk

To manage price risk, Dominion and Virginia Power primarily hold commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated
with purchases and sales of elec-



tricity, natural gas and other energy-related products. As part of its strategy to market energy and to manage related risks, Dominion also holds commodity-based financial derivative instruments
for trading purposes.

The derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are executed within established policies and
procedures and may include instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, options and FTRs that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the hypothetical change in market prices of commodity-based
financial derivative instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments.
Prices and volatility are principally determined based on observable market prices.

A hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in
market prices of Dominion’s non-trading commodity-based financial derivative instruments would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of approximately $183 million and $150 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A
hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $5 million and $11 million in the fair value of Dominion’s commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for trading purposes as
of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

A hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in commodity prices would not
have resulted in a material change in the fair value of Virginia Power’s non-trading commodity-based financial derivatives as of December 31, 2010 or 2009.

The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s non-trading commodity-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily
representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from commodity derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged
transaction, such as revenue from physical sales of the commodity.

Interest Rate Risk

Dominion and Virginia Power manage their interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. They also enter into interest rate sensitive derivatives,
including interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. For financial instruments designated under fair value hedging and outstanding for Dominion and Virginia Power, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would not have
resulted in a material change in annual earnings at December 31, 2010 or 2009.

Dominion and Virginia Power may also
use forward-starting interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements as anticipatory hedges. At December 31, 2009, Dominion and Virginia Power had $1.7 billion and $850 million, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these
interest rate derivatives outstanding. At December 31, 2009, a hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $62 million and $33 million in the fair value of these interest rate
derivatives held by Dominion and Virginia Power, respectively. Subsequent to June 30, 2010, all forward-starting

interest rate swap contracts were terminated; therefore, Dominion and Virginia Power have no sensitivity to changes in interest rates related to these interest rate swaps.

The impact of a change in market interest rates on these anticipatory hedges at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the
results that will be realized when such contracts are settled. Net gains and/or losses from interest rate derivatives used for anticipatory hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be amortized over the life of the respective debt
issuance being hedged.

Investment Price Risk

Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in decommissioning and rabbi trust funds that are managed by third-party investment managers. These
trust funds primarily hold marketable securities that are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

Dominion
recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $95 million and $25 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of
investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. In 2010 and 2009, Dominion recorded, in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on these investments of $182 million and $360 million, respectively.

Virginia Power recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust investments of $44
million in 2010. Virginia Power recognized net realized losses (net of investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust investments of $3 million in 2009. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well
as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. In 2010 and 2009, Virginia Power recorded, in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on these investments of $67 million and $149 million, respectively.

Dominion sponsors pension and other postretirement benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments.
Virginia Power employees participate in these plans. Aggregate actual returns for Dominion’s pension and other postretirement plan assets were $624 million in 2010 and $777 million in 2009, versus expected returns of $479 million and $462
million, respectively. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the periodic cost
recognized for employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, a hypothetical 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term
rates of return on Dominion’s plan assets would result in an increase in net periodic cost of approximately $13 million for pension benefits and $3 million for other postretirement benefits.

Risk Management Policies

Dominion and Virginia
Power have established operating procedures with corporate management to ensure that proper internal controls are maintained. In addition, Dominion has established an independent function at the corporate level to monitor compliance with the credit
and commodity risk management policies



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

of all subsidiaries, including Virginia Power. Dominion maintains credit policies that include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty’s financial condition, collateral requirements
where deemed necessary and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition, Dominion also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing
basis. Based

on these credit policies and Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s December 31, 2010 provision for credit losses, management believes that it is unlikely that a material adverse
effect on Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

PERATIONS

Dominion, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is one of the nation’s largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominion’s operations are
conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power, a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and North Carolina. Virginia Power is a member of PJM, an RTO, and its electric
transmission facilities are integrated into the PJM wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Power’s common stock is owned by Dominion. Dominion’s operations also include a regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and
underground storage system in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, an LNG import and storage facility in Maryland and regulated gas transportation and distribution operations in Ohio and West Virginia. As discussed in Note 4, Dominion
completed the sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010. In addition, Dominion completed the sale of its Pennsylvania gas distribution operations in February 2010, which are reported as discontinued operations.
Certain 2009 and 2008 amounts have been recast to reflect Peoples as discontinued operations. Dominion’s nonregulated operations include merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities and retail energy marketing
operations.

Dominion manages its daily operations through three primary operating segments: DVP, Dominion Generation and
Dominion Energy. Dominion also reports a Corporate and Other segment, which includes its corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt) and the net impact of Peoples and certain DCI operations, which are discussed in
Notes 4 and 25, respectively. In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominion’s operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’
performance or allocating resources among the segments.

Virginia Power manages its daily operations through two primary
operating segments: DVP and Dominion Generation. It also reports a Corporate and Other segment that primarily includes specific items attributable to its operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management
in assessing the segments’ performance or allocating resources among the segments. See Note 27 for further discussion of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operating segments.

General

Dominion and Virginia Power make certain
estimates and assumptions in preparing their Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, the accounts of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries.

Dominion and Virginia Power report certain contracts, instruments and investments at fair
value. See Note 7 for further information on fair value measurements.

Dominion maintains pension and other postretirement
benefit plans. Virginia Power participates in certain of these plans. See Note 22 for further information on these plans.

Certain amounts in the 2009 and 2008 Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the 2010
presentation for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect the Companies’ net income, total assets, liabilities, shareholders’ equity or cash flows.

Amounts disclosed for Dominion are inclusive of Virginia Power, where applicable.

Operating Revenue

Operating revenue is recorded on the basis of services rendered, commodities delivered or contracts settled and includes amounts yet to be
billed to customers. The Companies collect sales, consumption and consumer utility taxes; however, these amounts are excluded from revenue. Dominion’s customer receivables at December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $466 million and $409
million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity or natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its utility customers. Virginia Power’s customer receivables at December 31, 2010 and 2009
included $397 million and $355 million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity delivered but not yet billed to its customers.

The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Dominion are as follows:

Ÿ

Regulated electric sales

consist
primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales, and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services;

Ÿ

Nonregulated electric sales

consist
primarily of sales of electricity at market-based rates and contracted fixed rates, and associated derivative activity;

Ÿ

Regulated gas sales

consist primarily
of state-regulated retail natural gas sales and related distribution services;

Ÿ

Nonregulated gas sales

consist
primarily of sales of natural gas production at market-based rates and contracted fixed prices, sales of gas purchased from third parties, gas trading and marketing revenue and associated derivative activity. Revenue from sales of gas production is
recognized based on actual volumes of gas sold to purchasers and is reported net of royalties. Revenue from sales of gas production includes the sale of gas produced by Dominion and the recognition of revenue from the VPP transactions described in
Note 11;

Ÿ

Gas transportation and storage

consists primarily of regulated sales of gathering, transmission, distribution and storage services and associated derivative activity. Also included are regulated gas distribution charges to retail distribution service customers opting for
alternate suppliers; and

Ÿ

Other revenue

consists primarily of
sales of oil and NGL production and condensate, extracted products and associated derivative activity. Other revenue also includes miscellaneous service revenue from electric and gas distribution operations, and gas processing and handling revenue.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for
Virginia Power are as follows:

Ÿ

Regulated electric sales

consist
primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services; and

Ÿ

Other revenue

consists primarily of
excess generation sold at market-based rates, miscellaneous service revenue from electric distribution operations and other miscellaneous revenue.

Electric Fuel, Purchased Energy and Purchased Gas—Deferred Costs

Where permitted by regulatory
authorities, the differences between Virginia Power’s actual electric fuel and purchased energy expenses and Dominion’s purchased gas expenses and the related levels of recovery for these expenses in current rates are deferred and matched
against recoveries in future periods. The deferral of costs in excess of current period fuel rate recovery is recognized as a regulatory asset, while rate recovery in excess of current period fuel expenses is recognized as a regulatory liability.

Of the cost of fuel used in electric generation and energy purchases to serve utility customers, approximately 84% is
currently subject to deferred fuel accounting, while substantially all of the remaining amount is subject to recovery through similar mechanisms.

Income Taxes

A consolidated federal income tax
return is filed for Dominion and its subsidiaries, including Virginia Power. In addition, where applicable, combined income tax returns for Dominion and its subsidiaries are filed in various states; otherwise, separate state income tax returns are
filed. Virginia Power participates in an intercompany tax sharing agreement with Dominion and its subsidiaries and its current income taxes are based on its taxable income or loss, determined on a separate company basis.

Accounting for income taxes involves an asset and liability approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided,
representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion and Virginia Power establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not
that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Where the treatment of temporary differences is different for rate-regulated operations, a regulatory asset is recognized if it is probable that future revenues will be provided
for the payment of deferred tax liabilities.

Dominion and Virginia Power recognize positions taken, or expected to be taken,
in income tax returns that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.

If it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax position, or some portion thereof, will be sustained, the related tax benefits are not
recognized in the financial statements. For a substantial amount of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s unrecognized tax benefits, the ultimate deductibility is highly certain; however, there is uncertainty about the timing of such
deductibility. Unrecognized tax benefits may also include amounts for which uncertainty exists as to whether such amounts are deductible as ordinary deductions or capital losses. Unrecognized tax benefits may result in an increase in income taxes
payable, a reduction of income tax

refunds receivable or changes in deferred taxes. Also, when uncertainty about the deductibility of an amount is limited to the timing of such deductibility, the increase in income taxes payable
(or reduction in tax refunds receivable) is accompanied by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities. Noncurrent income taxes payable related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified in other deferred credits and other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets and current payables are included in accrued interest, payroll and taxes on the consolidated balance sheets, except when such amounts are presented net with amounts receivable from or amounts prepaid to tax authorities.

Dominion and Virginia Power recognize changes in estimated interest payable on net underpayments and overpayments of income
taxes in interest expense and estimated penalties that may result from the settlement of some uncertain tax positions in other income. In its Consolidated Statements of Income for 2010, 2009 and 2008, Dominion recognized a reduction in interest
expense of $18 million and a reduction in penalties of less than $1 million, a reduction in interest expense of $19 million and a reduction in penalties of $2 million and less than $1 million of interest expense and no penalties, respectively.
Dominion had accrued interest receivable of $27 million and interest and penalties payable of less than $1 million at December 31, 2010, and interest receivable of $26 million and interest and penalties payable of $4 million at
December 31, 2009.

Virginia Power’s interest and penalties were immaterial in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

At December 31, 2010, Virginia Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $46 million of prepaid federal and state income
taxes and $102 million of noncurrent federal and state income taxes payable. At December 31, 2009, Virginia Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $21 million of prepaid federal income taxes, $3 million of current state income
taxes payable and $45 million of noncurrent federal and state income taxes payable.

Investment tax credits are recognized by
nonregulated operations in the year qualifying property is placed in service. For regulated operations, investment tax credits are deferred and amortized over the service lives of the properties giving rise to the credits. Production tax credits are
recognized as energy is generated and sold.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Current banking arrangements generally do not require checks to be funded until they are presented for payment. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Dominion’s accounts payable included $56
million and $55 million, respectively, of checks outstanding but not yet presented for payment. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Virginia Power’s accounts payable included $28 million and $22 million, respectively, of checks outstanding
but not yet presented for payment. For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and temporary investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.

Derivative Instruments

Dominion and
Virginia Power use derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage the commodity, currency exchange and financial market risks of their business operations.



All derivatives, other than those for which an exception applies, are reported in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivative contracts representing unrealized gain positions and purchased options are reported as derivative assets. Derivative contracts representing unrealized losses and options sold are reported as
derivative liabilities. One of the exceptions to fair value accounting, normal purchases and normal sales, may be elected when the contract satisfies certain criteria, including a requirement that physical delivery of the underlying commodity is
probable. Expenses and revenues resulting from deliveries under normal purchase contracts and normal sales contracts, respectively, are included in earnings at the time of contract performance.

Dominion and Virginia Power do not offset amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash
collateral against amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. Dominion had margin assets of $244 million and $149 million associated with cash collateral at December
31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Dominion had margin liabilities of $62 million and $114 million associated with cash collateral at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Virginia Power’s margin assets and liabilities associated with cash
collateral were not material at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

To manage price risk, Dominion and Virginia Power hold certain
derivative instruments that are not held for trading purposes and are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. However, to the extent the Companies do not hold offsetting positions for such derivatives, they believe these instruments
represent economic hedges that mitigate their exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. As part of Dominion’s strategy to market energy and manage related risks, it also manages a portfolio of
commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for trading purposes. Dominion uses established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with price fluctuations in these energy commodities and uses various derivative instruments
to reduce risk by creating offsetting market positions.

Statement of Income Presentation:

Ÿ

Derivatives Held for Trading Purposes:

All income statement activity, including amounts realized upon settlement, is presented in operating revenue on a net basis.

Ÿ

Derivatives Not Held for Trading Purposes:

All income statement activity, including amounts realized upon settlement, is presented in operating revenue, operating expenses or interest and related charges based on the nature of the underlying
risk.

In Virginia Power’s generation operations, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments
result in the recognition of regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities for jurisdictions subject to cost-based rate regulation. Realized gains or losses on the derivative instruments are generally recognized when the related transactions impact
earnings.

EDGING

I

NSTRUMENTS

Dominion and Virginia Power designate a portion of their derivative instruments as either cash flow or fair
value hedges for accounting purposes. For all derivatives designated as hedges, Dominion and Virginia Power formally document the
relation-

ship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and the strategy for using the hedging instrument. The Companies assess whether the hedging
relationship between the derivative and the hedged item is highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Any change in the fair value of the derivative
that is not effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged item is recognized currently in earnings. Also, the Companies may elect to exclude certain gains or losses on hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness, such as gains or losses attributable to changes in the time value of options or changes in the difference between spot prices and forward prices, thus requiring that such changes be recorded currently in earnings. Hedge accounting is
discontinued prospectively for derivatives that cease to be highly effective hedges.

Cash Flow Hedges

—A majority
of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s hedge strategies represents cash flow hedges of the variable price risk associated with the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products. The Companies also use foreign
currency contracts to hedge the variability in foreign exchange rates and interest rate swaps to hedge their exposure to variable interest rates on long-term debt. For transactions in which Dominion and Virginia Power are hedging the variability of
cash flows, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in AOCI, to the extent they are effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item. Any derivative gains or losses reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the
forecasted item is included in earnings, or earlier, if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur. For cash flow hedge transactions, hedge accounting is discontinued if the occurrence of the forecasted transaction is no
longer probable.

Fair Value Hedges

—Dominion and Virginia Power also use fair value hedges to mitigate the fixed
price exposure inherent in certain firm commodity commitments and commodity inventory. In addition, they have designated interest rate swaps as fair value hedges on certain fixed-rate long-term debt to manage interest rate exposure. For fair value
hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative are generally offset currently in earnings by the recognition of changes in the hedged item’s fair value. Derivative gains and losses from the hedged item are reclassified to
earnings when the hedged item is included in earnings, or earlier, if the hedged item no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Hedge accounting is discontinued if the hedged item no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

See Note 7 for further information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives. See Note 8 for further
information on derivatives.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including additions and replacements is recorded at original cost, consisting of labor and materials and other direct and indirect costs such as asset retirement costs,
capitalized interest and, for certain operations subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, AFUDC and overhead costs. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including minor additions and replacements, is charged to expense as it is incurred.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, Dominion capitalized interest costs and AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $102 million, $76
million and $88 million, respectively. In 2010, 2009 and



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

2008, Virginia Power capitalized interest costs and AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $61 million, $47 million and $21 million, respectively. Under current Virginia legislation, certain
Virginia jurisdictional projects qualify for current recovery of AFUDC through rate adjustment clauses. AFUDC on these projects is calculated and recorded as a regulatory asset and is not capitalized to property, plant and equipment. In 2010, 2009
and 2008, Virginia Power recorded $13 million, $34 million and $18 million of AFUDC related to these projects, respectively.

For Virginia Power property subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, including electric distribution, electric transmission, and
generation property and for certain Dominion natural gas property, the undepreciated cost of such property, less salvage value, is generally charged to accumulated depreciation at retirement, with gains and losses recorded on the sales of property.
Cost of removal collections from utility customers not representing AROs are recorded as regulatory liabilities.

For Dominion
and Virginia Power property that is not subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, including nonutility property, cost of removal not associated with AROs is charged to expense as incurred. The Companies also record gains and losses upon retirement
based upon the difference between the proceeds received, if any, and the property’s net book value at the retirement date.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line method based on projected service lives. Dominion’s
and Virginia Power’s depreciation rates on utility property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Dominion’s nonutility property, plant and equipment, excluding E&P properties, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Asset

Estimated Useful Lives

Merchant generation—nuclear

29–44 years

Merchant generation—other

8–40 years

General and other

3–25 years

Nuclear fuel used in electric generation is amortized over its estimated service life on a units-of-production basis. Dominion and Virginia Power report the amortization of nuclear fuel in electric fuel
and other energy-related purchases expense in their Consolidated Statements of Income and in depreciation and amortization in their Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Dominion follows the full cost method of accounting for its gas and oil E&P activities, which subjects capitalized costs to a

quarterly ceiling test using hedge-adjusted prices. Due to the April 2010 sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations, as of December 31, 2010, Dominion no longer
has any significant gas and oil properties subject to the ceiling test calculation.

At March 31, 2010, Dominion recorded
a ceiling test impairment charge of $21 million ($13 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to a decline in hedge-adjusted prices reflecting the discontinuance of hedge
accounting for certain cash flow hedges, as discussed in Note 4.

In 2009, Dominion recorded a ceiling test impairment charge
of $455 million ($281 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income. Excluding the effects of hedge-adjusted prices in calculating the ceiling limitation, the impairment would have been $631
million ($387 million after-tax).

In 2010, Dominion recognized a gain from the sale of substantially all of its Appalachian
E&P operations as discussed in Note 4.

Emissions Allowances

Emissions allowances permit the holder of the allowance to emit certain gaseous by-products of fossil fuel combustion, including SO


, NO

X

and CO


. SO


and NO

X

emissions allowances are issued to Dominion and Virginia Power by the EPA and may also be purchased and sold via third
party contracts. CO


emissions allowances are available for
purchase by Dominion through quarterly auctions held by participating RGGI states. The first RGGI auctions of
CO


allowances were conducted in 2008 to be used for the
compliance period beginning in 2009 and extending through 2011. Compliance with the RGGI requirements only applies to certain of Dominion’s merchant power stations located in the Northeast.

Allowances held may be transacted with third parties or consumed as these emissions are generated. Allowances allocated to or acquired by
the Companies’ generation operations are held primarily for consumption.

Allowances held for
consumption are classified as intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Carrying amounts are based on the cost to acquire the allowances or, in the case of a business combination, on the fair values assigned to them in the allocation of
the purchase price of the acquired business. A portion of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s SO


and NO

X

allowances are issued by the EPA at zero cost.

These allowances are amortized in the periods the emissions are generated, with
the amortization reflected in DD&A in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Purchases and sales of these allowances are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and gains or losses resulting from sales are
reported in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

Dominion and Virginia Power perform an evaluation for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
long-lived assets or intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. A long-lived or intangible asset is written down to fair value if the sum of its expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying amount.



Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 7 for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The accounting
for Dominion’s regulated gas and Virginia Power’s regulated electric operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that they are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial
Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is
probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities
are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are
amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Dominion and Virginia Power recognize AROs at fair value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate
of the fair value of future retirement activities to be performed. These amounts are capitalized as costs of the related tangible long-lived assets. Since relevant market information is not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash
flow analyses. Virginia Power reports accretion of the AROs associated with nuclear decommissioning of its nuclear power stations due to the passage of time as an adjustment to the related regulatory liability for certain jurisdictions, consistent
with the practice for its other cost-of-service rate regulated operations. Dominion and Virginia Power report accretion of all other AROs in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs

Dominion and
Virginia Power defer and amortize debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts over the expected lives of the respective debt issues, considering maturity dates and, if applicable, redemption rights held by others. As permitted by regulatory
authorities, gains or losses resulting from the refinancing of debt allocable to utility operations subject to cost-based rate regulation have also been deferred and are amortized over the lives of the new issuances.

Decommissioning Trust Investments—Special Considerations

Ÿ

Debt Securities

—The FASB amended its guidance for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, which Dominion and
Virginia Power adopted effective April 1, 2009. The recognition provisions of this



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

guidance apply only to debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, while the presentation and disclosure requirements apply to both debt and equity securities. Prior to
the adoption of this guidance, Dominion and Virginia Power considered all debt securities held by their nuclear decommissioning trusts with market values below their cost bases to be other-than-temporarily impaired as they did not have the ability
to ensure the investments were held through the anticipated recovery period.

Effective with the adoption of this guidance, using information obtained from their nuclear decommissioning trust fixed-income investment managers, Dominion and Virginia Power record in earnings any unrealized loss for a debt security when the
manager intends to sell the debt security or it is more-likely-than-not that the manager will have to sell the debt security before recovery of its fair value up to its cost basis. If that is the case, but the debt security is deemed to have
experienced a credit loss, the Companies record the credit loss in earnings and any remaining portion of the unrealized loss in other comprehensive income. Credit losses are evaluated primarily by considering the credit ratings of the issuer, prior
instances of non-performance by the issuer and other factors.

Ÿ

Equity securities and other investments

—Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s method of assessing other-than-temporary declines
requires demonstrating the ability to hold individual securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in their market value prior to the consideration of the other criteria mentioned above. Since the Companies have
limited ability to oversee the day-to-day management of nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, they do not have the ability to ensure investments are held through an anticipated recovery period. Accordingly, they consider all equity and
other securities as well as non-marketable investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts with market values below their cost bases to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

Inventories

Materials and supplies and fossil fuel inventories are valued primarily using the
weighted-average cost method. Stored gas inventory used in Dominion’s Ohio gas distribution operations is valued using the LIFO method. Under the LIFO method, stored gas inventory was valued at $48 million and $30 million at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Based on the average price of gas purchased during 2010 and 2009, the cost of replacing the current portion of stored gas inventory exceeded the amount stated on a LIFO basis by approximately $107
million and $172 million, respectively. Stored gas inventory held by certain nonregulated gas operations is valued using the weighted-average cost method.

Gas Imbalances

Natural gas imbalances occur when
the physical amount of natural gas delivered from, or received by, a pipeline system or storage facility differs from the contractual amount of natural gas delivered or received. Dominion values these imbalances due to, or from, shippers and
operators at an appropriate index price at period end, subject to the terms of its tariff for regulated entities.

Imbalances are primarily settled in-kind. Imbalances due to Dominion from other parties are reported in other current assets and imbalances that Dominion owes to other parties are reported in
other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Goodwill

Dominion evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of April 1 and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount.

TATEMENTS

Effective January 1, 2009, Dominion adopted new accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests that requires retrospective
application of presentation and disclosure changes including that noncontrolling interests be reported as a component of equity and that net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interests be separately identified in the income
statement.

As discussed in Note 25, Dominion previously consolidated an investment in the subordinated notes of a third-party
CDO entity held by DCI, which was deconsolidated as of March 31, 2008. The noncontrolling interest income from the CDO entity was previously reported in minority interest in Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Income and in operating
activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Dominion’s subsidiary preferred dividends were previously included in interest and related charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income and in operating activities in its Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. Due to the application of new accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests, Dominion now reflects its interest in the previously held CDO entity’s income and its subsidiary preferred dividends as an adjustment
(noncontrolling interests) to arrive at net income attributable to Dominion in its Consolidated Statements of Income and reflects its subsidiary preferred dividends in financing activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Since
Dominion’s subsidiary preferred stock does not qualify as permanent equity, Dominion continues to report these amounts as mezzanine equity in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.

they did not have the ability to ensure the investments were held through the anticipated recovery period.



Upon the adoption of this guidance for debt investments held at April 1, 2009,
Dominion recorded a $20 million ($12 million after-tax) and Virginia Power recorded a $3 million ($2 million after-tax) cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reclassify the non-credit related portion of previously recognized
other-than-temporary impairments from retained earnings to AOCI, reflecting the fixed-income investment managers’ intent and ability to hold the debt securities until recovery of their fair values up to their cost bases.

EASUREMENTS

Dominion and Virginia Power adopted new FASB guidance effective January 1, 2008, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures related to fair
value measurements. The guidance applies broadly to financial and non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements, but does not expand the application of fair value accounting
to any new circumstances.

Generally, the provisions of this guidance were applied prospectively. Certain situations, however,
required retrospective application as of the beginning of the year of adoption through the recognition of a cumulative effect of accounting change. Such retrospective application was required for financial instruments, including derivatives and
certain hybrid instruments with limitations on initial gains or losses. Retrospective application resulted in an immaterial amount recognized through a cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008
for Dominion and no adjustment for Virginia Power.

Effective January 1, 2008, Dominion adopted new accounting guidance for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of
endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. This guidance specifies that if an employer provides a benefit to an employee under the endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangement that extends to post-retirement periods, it should
recognize a liability for future benefits based on the substantive agreement with the employee. Dominion’s adoption of this
guid-

ance resulted in an immaterial amount recognized through a cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008.

ISPOSITIONS

Sale of Appalachian E&P Operations

In April 2010, Dominion completed the sale of substantially
all of its Appalachian E&P operations to a newly-formed subsidiary of CONSOL for approximately $3.5 billion. The transaction includes the mineral rights to approximately 491,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale formation. Dominion retained certain
oil and natural gas wells located on or near its natural gas storage fields. The transaction generated after-tax proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion and resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion, which includes a $134 million
write-off of goodwill. Proceeds from the sale have been or will be used to pay taxes on the gain, offset all of Dominion’s equity needs for 2010 and its expected market equity issuance needs for 2011, repurchase common stock, fund contributions
to Dominion’s pension plans and the Dominion Foundation, reduce debt and offset the majority of the impact of Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case settlement.

The results of operations for Dominion’s Appalachian E&P business are not reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income since Dominion did not sell its entire U.S.
cost pool.

Due to the sale, hedge accounting was discontinued for certain cash flow hedges since it became probable that the
forecasted sales of gas would not occur. In connection with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for these contracts, Dominion recognized a $42 million ($25 million after-tax) benefit, recorded in operating revenue in its Consolidated Statement of
Income, reflecting the reclassification of gains from AOCI to earnings for these contracts in March 2010.

Sale of Peoples

In February 2010, Dominion completed the sale of Peoples to PNG Companies LLC and netted after-tax proceeds of approximately $542 million.
The sale resulted in an after-tax loss of approximately $140 million, including post-closing adjustments, and a $79 million write-off of goodwill. The sale also resulted in after-tax expenses of approximately $27 million, including transaction and
benefit-related costs. Prior to the sale, Peoples had income from operations of $12 million after-tax during 2010.

Prior to
March 31, 2010, Dominion did not report Peoples as discontinued operations since it expected to have significant continuing cash flows related primarily to the sale of natural gas production from its Appalachian E&P operations to Peoples.
Due to the sale of its Appalachian E&P operations, Dominion will not have significant continuing cash flows with Peoples; therefore, the results of Peoples were reclassified to discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for
all periods presented. Certain 2009 and 2008 amounts have been recast to reflect Peoples as discontinued operations.

The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for
sale in Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

The following table presents selected information regarding the results of operations of Peoples, which are reported as discontinued operations in Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Income:

AXES

Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since
tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Dominion and Virginia Power are routinely audited by federal and state tax authorities. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and
cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.

In 2010, U.S. federal legislation was
enacted that allows taxpayers to fully deduct qualifying capital expenditures incurred after September 8, 2010, through the end of 2011, when placed in service before 2013, and otherwise provides an extension of the fifty percent bonus depreciation
allowance for qualifying capital expenditures through 2012. However, there is uncertainty about the earliest date on which construction of property by or for a taxpayer could have begun in order to qualify for the full deduction of qualifying
capital expenditures. Clarifying guidance is expected from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2011. For Dominion and Virginia Power, income taxes payable have been reduced and deferred tax liabilities have increased in 2010 as a result of claiming
these benefits.



Continuing Operations

Details of income tax expense for continuing operations including noncontrolling interests were as follows:

For continuing operations including noncontrolling interests, the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s effective income tax rate as follows:

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s effective tax rates in 2010 reflect reductions of deferred tax assets of $57 million and $17
million, respectively, resulting from the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, which eliminated the employer’s deduction, beginning in 2013, for
that portion of its retiree prescription drug coverage cost that is being reimbursed by the Medicare Part D subsidy. In addition, Dominion’s effective tax rate in 2010 includes higher state income taxes and the impact of goodwill written off
that is not deductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the Appalachian E&P operations.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s effective tax rates in 2009 reflect the reduction
of uncertainties regarding the calculation of the domestic production activities deduction as a result of working with the IRS under its Pre-Filing Program. The objective of the Pre-Filing Program is to provide taxpayers with greater certainty
regarding a specific issue at an earlier point in time than can be attained under the normal post-filing examination process.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

The Companies’ deferred income taxes consist
of the following:

At December 31, 2010, Dominion had the following loss and credit carryforwards:

Ÿ

Federal loss carryforwards of $38 million that expire if unutilized during the period 2014 through 2021;

Ÿ

State loss carryforwards of $840 million that expire if unutilized during the period 2011 through 2030. A valuation allowance on $701 million of these
carryforwards has been established; and

Ÿ

State minimum tax credits of $94 million that do not expire.

There were no loss or credit carryforwards for Virginia Power at December 31, 2010.

Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be
examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The amount of tax return positions that are not recognized in the financial statements is disclosed as unrecognized tax benefits. These unrecognized tax benefits may impact
the



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

financial statements by increasing income taxes payable, reducing tax refunds receivable or changing deferred taxes. Also, when uncertainty about the deductibility of an amount is limited to the
timing of such deductibility, the increase in taxes payable (or reduction in tax refunds receivable) is accompanied by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities.

A reconciliation of changes in the Companies’ unrecognized tax benefits follows:

Certain unrecognized tax benefits, or portions thereof, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from claims for tax benefits, or portions
thereof, that may not be realized, remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitation. For Dominion and its subsidiaries, these unrecognized tax benefits were $133 million, $95
million and $121 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For Dominion, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits increased income tax expense by $38 million in 2010, decreased income tax expense by $26 million in 2009 and
increased tax expense by $25 million in 2008. For Virginia Power, these unrecognized tax benefits were $14 million, $14 million and $21 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For Virginia Power, the change in these
unrecognized tax benefits increased income tax expense by less than $1 million in 2010, decreased income tax expense by $7 million in 2009 and increased income tax expense by $13 million in 2008.

A substantial amount of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s unrecognized tax benefits balances at December 31, 2010 represents
tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain; however, there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. When uncertainty about the deductibility of amounts is limited to the timing of such deductibility, any tax
liabilities recognized for prior periods would be subject to offset with the availability of refundable amounts from later periods when such deductions could otherwise be taken. Some prior year unrecognized tax benefits had involved uncertainty as
to whether the amounts were deductible as ordinary deductions or capital losses. Pending resolution of these uncertainties, interest is accrued until the period in which the amounts would become deductible.

For Dominion and its subsidiaries, the U.S. federal statute of limitations has expired for
years prior to 2004, except that the right to pursue refunds related to certain deductions has been reserved for the years 1995 through 2003.

In 2010, the IRS began its examination of Dominion’s consolidated tax returns for tax years 2006 and 2007, and Dominion began settlement negotiations with the Appellate Division of the IRS regarding
adjustments proposed in the examination of its consolidated tax returns for 2004 and 2005. Other than two tax positions for which Dominion will reserve the right to litigate and pursue claims for refunds, Dominion and the IRS have agreed on the
resolution of the issues for 2004 and 2005. The settlement is subject to review by the Joint Committee.

In September 2010, the
Appellate Division of the IRS informed Dominion that the Joint Committee had approved the settlement of tax years 2002 and 2003 for Dominion and its consolidated subsidiaries. Dominion received a refund of $54 million in November 2010. The
settlement excludes two issues, for which Dominion has reserved the right to litigate and pursue claims for refunds.

In 2009,
the Joint Committee completed its review of Dominion’s settlement with the Appellate Division of the IRS for tax years 1999 through 2001. Dominion was entitled to a $60 million refund, of which $20 million was applied as an estimated payment
for 2009 taxes and $40 million was paid to Dominion in October 2009. In addition, Dominion received a $5 million refund for 1998 due to loss carryback adjustments. Virginia Power was entitled to a $39 million refund, of which $20 million was applied
as an estimated payment for 2009 taxes and $19 million was paid to Virginia Power in October 2009. The refunds had no impact on earnings.

During examinations by tax authorities in 2011, it is reasonably possible that Dominion and tax authorities could agree to apply procedures used previously to resolve similar tax return filing positions,
reducing Dominion’s unrecognized tax benefits by $50 million to $70 million and Virginia Power’s unrecognized tax benefits by $30 million to $35 million. Dominion’s unrecognized tax benefits could also be reduced by $15 million,
including $5 million for Virginia Power, to recognize prior period amounts becoming otherwise deductible in 2011. If such changes were to occur, other than revisions of the accrual for interest on tax underpayments and overpayments,
Dominion’s earnings could increase by up to $25 million with no material impact on Virginia Power’s earnings.

Otherwise, with regard to 2010 and prior years, Dominion and Virginia Power cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible changes to
unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in 2011.

For each of the major states in which Dominion operates, the earliest tax
year remaining open for examination is as follows:

(1)

Virginia is the only state considered major for Virginia Power’s operations.



Dominion and Virginia Power are also obligated to report adjustments resulting from IRS
settlements to state tax authorities. In addition, if Dominion utilizes state net operating losses or tax credits generated in years for which the statute of limitations has expired, such amounts are subject to examination.

Discontinued Operations

Income tax expense in 2010
for Dominion’s discontinued operations primarily reflects the impact of goodwill written off in the sale of Peoples that is not deductible for tax purposes and the reversal of deferred taxes for which the benefit was offset by the reversal of
income tax-related regulatory assets.

Income tax expense in 2008 for Dominion’s discontinued operations reflects the
reversal of $120 million of deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2006, associated with the excess of its financial reporting basis over the tax basis in the stock of Peoples. In 2006, based on the terms of a previous agreement to sell Peoples,
Dominion recognized these deferred tax liabilities since the difference between the financial reporting basis and its tax basis in the stock of the subsidiaries was expected to reverse upon closing of the sale. In January 2008, Dominion agreed to
terminate the agreement for the sale of Peoples and Hope. At that time, based on its expectation that the form of any future disposal of these subsidiaries would be structured so that the taxable gain would instead be determined by reference to the
basis in the subsidiaries’ underlying assets, Dominion reversed the related deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2006. Dominion executed a new agreement in July 2008 to sell Peoples and Hope, but decided in December 2009 to sell only Peoples.
Dominion determined its taxable gain by reference to the basis in the subsidiary’s underlying assets.

EASUREMENTS

As described in Note 3, Dominion and Virginia Power adopted new FASB guidance for fair value measurements effective January 1, 2008. Fair value is
defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. However, the use of a mid-market pricing convention (the
mid-point between bid and ask prices) is permitted. Fair values are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in valuation techniques and the
inputs to valuations. This includes not only the credit standing of counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements but also the impact of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s own nonperformance risk on their liabilities. Fair
value measurements assume that the transaction occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability (the market with the most volume and activity for the asset or liability from the perspective of the reporting entity), or in the absence of a
principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability (the market in which the reporting entity would be able to maximize the amount received or minimize the amount paid). Dominion and Virginia Power apply fair value measurements
to certain assets and liabilities including commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, and nuclear decommissioning trust and other investments including those held in Dominion’s rabbi, pension

and other postretirement benefit plan trusts, in accordance with the requirements described above. The Companies apply credit adjustments to their derivative fair values in accordance with the
requirements described above. These credit adjustments are currently not material to the derivative fair values.

The Companies
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, they seek price
information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, they consider whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted
price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or
if the Companies believe that observable pricing is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases they must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price
information and certain statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect their market assumptions.

For options
and contracts with option-like characteristics where observable pricing information is not available from external sources, the Companies generally use a modified Black-Scholes Model that considers time value, the volatility of the underlying
commodities and other relevant assumptions when estimating fair value. The Companies use other option models under special circumstances, including a Spread Approximation Model when contracts include different commodities or commodity locations and
a Swing Option Model when contracts allow either the buyer or seller the ability to exercise within a range of quantities. For contracts with unique characteristics, the Companies may estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow approach deemed
appropriate in the circumstances and applied consistently from period to period. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a significant effect on the contract’s estimated fair value.

The inputs and assumptions used in measuring fair value include the following:

For commodity and foreign currency derivative contracts:

Forward commodity prices

Dominion and Virginia Power regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to estimate fair value by a number of methods, including review and verification of models, as well as various market price
verification procedures such as the use of pricing services and multiple broker quotes to support the market price of the various commodities and investments in which the Companies transact.

The Companies also utilize the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value, into three broad levels:

Ÿ

Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that they have the ability to access at the measurement
date. Instruments categorized in Level 1 primarily consist of financial instruments such as the majority of exchange-traded derivatives, and exchange-listed equities, mutual funds and certain Treasury securities held in nuclear decommissioning trust
funds for Dominion and Virginia Power and rabbi and benefit plan trust funds for Dominion.

Ÿ

Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability,
including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs
that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means. Instruments categorized in Level 2 primarily include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity forwards and swaps, interest rate swaps, foreign
currency forwards and options, certain Treasury securities, money market funds, and corporate, state and municipal debt securities held in nuclear decommissioning trust funds for Dominion and Virginia Power and rabbi and benefit plan trust funds for
Dominion.

Ÿ

Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or
liability. Instruments categorized in Level 3 for Dominion and Virginia Power consist of long-dated commodity derivatives, FTRs and other modeled commodity derivatives. Additional instruments categorized in Level 3 for Dominion include NGLs and
natural gas peaking options and alternative investments, consisting of investments in partnerships, joint ventures and other alternative investments, held in benefit plan trust funds.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the
appli-

cable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the
asset or liability.

Fair value measurements are categorized as Level 3 when a significant amount of price or other inputs that
are considered to be unobservable are used in their valuations. Long-dated commodity derivatives are generally based on unobservable inputs due to the length of time to settlement and the absence of market activity and are therefore categorized as
Level 3. For NGL derivatives, market illiquidity requires a valuation based on proxy markets that do not always correlate to the actual instrument, therefore they are categorized as Level 3. FTRs are categorized as Level 3 fair value measurements
because the only relevant pricing available comes from ISO auctions, which is accurate for day-one valuation, but generally is not considered to be representative of the ultimate settlement values. Other modeled commodity derivatives have
unobservable inputs in their valuation, mostly due to non-transparent and illiquid markets. Alternative investments are categorized as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, illiquidity and the long-term nature of these assets. These
investments are generally valued using NAV based on the proportionate share of the fair value as determined by reference to the most recent audited fair value financial statements or fair value statements provided by the investment manager adjusted
for any significant events occurring between the investment manager’s and the Companies’ measurement date.

For
derivative contracts, Dominion and Virginia Power recognize transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 based on fair values as of the first day of the month in which the transfer occurs. Transfers out of Level 3 represent assets and
liabilities that were previously classified as Level 3 for which the inputs became observable for classification in either Level 1 or Level 2. Because the activity and liquidity of commodity markets vary substantially between regions
and time periods, the availability of observable inputs for substantially the full term and value of the Companies’ over-the-counter derivative contracts is subject to change.

At December 31, 2010, Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s net balance of commodity derivatives categorized as Level 3 fair
value measurements was a net liability of $50 million and a net asset of $14 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would increase Dominion’s net liability by $69 million and decrease Virginia Power’s net
asset by $2 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease in commodity prices would decrease Dominion’s net liability by $66 million and increase Virginia Power’s net asset by $2 million.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

Partnership investments held by Virginia Power’s nuclear
decommissioning trust funds and Dominion’s rabbi trust funds are accounted for as cost method investments. These investments are only subject to fair value measurement on a non-recurring basis when they have experienced an impairment, and are
categorized as Level 3 fair value measurements. During 2009, substantially all of these partnership investments experienced impairments. During 2010, these partnership investments did not experience material impairments, therefore no such
nonrecurring fair value measurements occurred.

In connection with partnership investments, Dominion and Virginia Power (as a
limited partner) make capital commitments



that are called over time as the general partner makes investments. Investment strategies of the Companies’ partnership investments are primarily real estate and private equity-based. The
typical term of these partnership investments is 10-15 years. The Companies have limited withdrawal or redemption rights during the term of the partnership. As a general rule, a limited partner’s interest can be sold in the secondary markets
subject to the approval of the general partner. The secondary market tends to be illiquid especially during periods of market stress. Funds are returned to Dominion and Virginia Power as income, profits and capital are distributed over the term of
the partnership.

Presented below are the fair values, unfunded commitments and estimated liquidation periods for partnership
investments held by Virginia Power’s decommissioning trust funds and Dominion’s rabbi trust funds at December 31, 2009:

During 2009, Dominion evaluated an equity method investment for impairment and recorded a $30 million impairment in other income in its Consolidated Statement of Income. The resulting fair value of $4
million was estimated using a discounted cash flow model and is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs related to the timing and amount of future equity distributions based on the
investee’s future financing structure, contractual and market-based revenues and operating costs.

During 2010, Dominion evaluated State Line, a coal-fired merchant power
station with minimal environmental controls, for impairment due to the station’s relatively low level of profitability combined with the EPA’s issuance in June 2010 of a new stringent 1-hour primary NAAQS for SO


that will likely require significant environmental capital expenditures
in the future. As a result of this evaluation, Dominion recorded an impairment charge of $163 million ($107 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income, to write down State Line’s
long-lived assets to their estimated fair value of $59 million. As management was not aware of any recent market transactions for comparable assets with sufficient transparency to develop a market approach to fair value, Dominion relied on the
income approach (discounted cash flows) to estimate the fair value of State Line’s long-lived assets. This was considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs including estimates of future power and
other commodity prices.

In December 2010, Dominion recorded an impairment charge of $31 million ($20 million after-tax) in
other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income, to write down the long-lived assets of Salem Harbor to their estimated fair value of less than $1 million as a result of profitability issues. As management was not
aware of any recent market transactions for comparable assets with sufficient transparency to develop a market approach to fair value, Dominion relied on the income approach to estimate the fair value of Salem Harbor’s long-lived assets. This
was considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs including estimates of future power and other commodity prices.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

Fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within
the fair value hierarchy with a separate reconciliation of fair value measurements categorized as Level 3. Fair value disclosures for assets held in Dominion’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are presented in Note 22.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Substantially
all of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s financial instruments are recorded at fair value, with the exception of the instruments described below that are reported at historical cost. Estimated fair values have been determined using available

the short-term nature of these instruments. For Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, the carrying amounts and fair values are as follows:

(1)

Fair value is estimated using market prices, where available, and interest rates currently available for issuance of debt with similar terms and

Dominion and Virginia Power are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity,
natural gas and other energy-related products they market and purchase, as well as currency exchange and interest rate risks of their business operations. The Companies use derivative instruments to manage exposure to these risks, and designate
certain derivative instruments as fair value or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. As discussed in Note 2, for jurisdictions subject to cost-based rate regulation, changes in the fair value of derivatives are deferred as regulatory assets or
regulatory liabilities until the related transactions impact earnings. See Note 7 for further information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives.

The following table presents selected
information related to gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI in Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010:

The amounts that will be
reclassified from AOCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transactions (e.g., anticipated sales) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies
and will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in market prices and interest rates.

The sale
of the majority of Dominion’s remaining E&P operations resulted in the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain cash flow hedges, as discussed in Note 4.



In addition, changes to Dominion’s financing needs during the first and second
quarters of 2010 resulted in the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain cash flow hedges since it was determined that the forecasted interest payments would not occur. In connection with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for these
contracts, Dominion recognized a benefit recorded to interest and related charges reflecting the reclassification of gains from AOCI to earnings of $110 million ($67 million after-tax) for 2010. The reclassification of gains from AOCI to earnings
was partially offset by subsequent changes in fair value for these contracts of $37 million ($23 million after-tax) for 2010.

Investments that Dominion accounts for under the equity method of accounting are as follows:

(1)

In September 2009, Dominion received a $123 million distribution from Fowler Ridge based on proceeds received in connection with non-recourse permanent financing for
the first phase of the project.

Dominion’s equity earnings on these investments totaled $42 million in
both 2010 and 2009 and $52 million in 2008. Excluding the 2009 distribution from Fowler Ridge, Dominion received distributions from these investments of $60 million, $63 million and $12 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. As of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amount of Dominion’s investments exceeded Dominion’s share of underlying equity in net assets by approximately $7 million and $19 million, respectively. Excluding the impairment losses
discussed below, the differences relate to Dominion’s investments in wind projects and primarily reflect its capitalized interest during construction and the excess of its cash contributions over the book value of development assets contributed
by Dominion’s partners for these projects. The differences are generally being amortized over the

useful lives of the underlying assets.

During 2009, Dominion recognized
total impairment losses of $30 million in connection with a decline in estimated fair value of one of its equity method investments as discussed in Note 7. During 2008, Dominion recognized a $7 million gain on the sale of one of its equity method

Volumetric Production Payment Transactions

During 2007, in conjunction with the sale of Dominion’s non-Appalachian E&P operations, Dominion paid $250 million to terminate their existing VPP agreements and retained the VPP royalty
interests formerly associated with these agreements. Production from VPP royalty interests declined significantly in 2009, reflecting the expiration of these interests in February 2009.

Assignment of Marcellus Acreage

In 2008, Dominion completed a transaction with Antero to assign
drilling rights to approximately 117,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale formation located in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

Dominion received proceeds of approximately $347 million. The net proceeds were credited to Dominion’s full cost pool, reducing property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, as the transaction did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of natural gas and oil. Under the agreement, Dominion received a 7.5% overriding royalty interest on future natural gas production
from the assigned acreage and retained the drilling rights in traditional formations both above and below the Marcellus Shale. However, as a result of the sale of substantially all of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations, the overriding
royalty interest was transferred to CONSOL.

Jointly-Owned Power Stations

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s proportionate share of jointly-owned power stations at December 31, 2010 is as follows:

In February 2010,
Dominion completed the sale of Peoples to PNG Companies LLC and netted after-tax proceeds of approximately $542 million. The sale resulted in an after-tax loss of approximately $140 million, which included a $79 million write-off of goodwill.

In April 2010, Dominion completed the sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations to a newly-formed
subsidiary of CONSOL for approximately $3.5 billion. The transaction resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion, which included a $134 million write-off of goodwill.

In December 2009, Dominion made the decision to retain Hope and include it with East Ohio in Dominion’s gas distribution business
within the Dominion Energy segment. Goodwill was allocated from the Corporate and Other segment to the Dominion Energy segment based on the relative fair values of Hope and Peoples, which remained held-for-sale within the Dominion Corporate and
Other segment. Dominion did not perform an interim impairment test in 2009 as no events occurred that would more-likely-than-not reduce the reporting units’ fair values below their carrying values.

The following is a discussion of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s pending regulatory matters.

Electric Regulation in Virginia

Prior to the
Regulation Act, which significantly changed electricity regulation in Virginia, Virginia Power’s Virginia jurisdictional base rates were to be capped at 1999 levels until December 31, 2010, at which time Virginia was to convert to retail
competition for its electric supply service. The Regulation Act ended capped rates two years early, on December 31, 2008, at which time retail competition was made available only to individual retail customers with a demand of more than 5 MW
and non-residential retail customers who obtain Virginia Commission approval to aggregate their load to reach the 5 MW threshold. Individual retail customers are also permitted to purchase renewable energy from competitive suppliers if their
incumbent electric utility does not offer a 100% renewable energy tariff.

The Regulation Act also authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of
costs for new generation projects, FERC-approved transmission costs, environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs. The Regulation Act provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures on
specific new generation projects, including but not limited to nuclear generation, clean coal/carbon capture compatible generation, and renewable generation projects. The Regulation Act also continues statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to
file annual fuel cost recovery cases with the Virginia Commission.

Pursuant to the Regulation Act, the Virginia Commission
entered an order in January 2009 initiating the 2009 Base Rate Review. In connection with the 2009 Base Rate Review, Virginia Power submitted base rate filings and accompanying schedules to the Virginia Commission during 2009. In February 2010,
Virginia Power filed a revised Stipulation and Recommendation with the Virginia Commission, which had the support of all of the interested parties, including the Staff of the Virginia Commission. Virginia Power’s fourth quarter 2009 results
included a charge of $782 million ($477 million after-tax) representing its best estimate at the time of the probable outcome of the 2009 Base Rate Review. In March 2010, the Virginia Commission issued the Virginia Settlement Approval Order that
concluded the 2009 Base Rate Review and resolved open issues relating to Virginia Power’s fuel factor and Rider T. An ROE issue relating to Riders R, S, C1 and C2 was also resolved.

The Virginia Settlement Approval Order included the following provisions:

Credits from 2008 Revenues

Ÿ

Credits to customers of $400 million from Virginia Power’s 2008 revenues to be applied against base rates and rider
charges.

Base Rates

Ÿ

No change in Virginia Power’s base rates in existence prior to September 1, 2009 until December 1, 2013 (unless emergency rate relief is
warranted by statute);

Ÿ

Refund increased revenues collected under the interim base rates since September 1, 2009; and

Ÿ

An ROE of 11.9% (inclusive of a performance incentive of 60 basis points) for use in the Virginia Commission’s assessment in the upcoming biennial
rate review of Virginia Power’s earnings.

FTR Credits

Ÿ

Credits to customers of $129 million, inclusive of any carrying charge, relating to revenues from FTRs for the period July 1, 2007 through
June 30, 2009.

Generation Riders R and S

Ÿ

An ROE of 12.3% (inclusive of a 100 basis point statutory enhancement) for the 2010 rate year.

Transmission Rider T

Ÿ

Waiver of recovery, effective January 1, 2011, of deferred RTO start-up and administrative costs in the amount of $197 million (including carrying
charges) that were previously approved for recovery through Rider T.



DSM Riders C1 and C2

Ÿ

An ROE of 11.3% for the 2010 rate year.

Commencing in 2011, the Virginia Commission will conduct biennial reviews of Virginia Power’s base rates, terms and conditions. In the biennial review, as in the 2009 Base Rate Review, Virginia
Power’s authorized ROE can be no lower than the average of that reported by not less than a majority of comparable utilities within the Southeastern U.S., with certain limitations as described in the Regulation Act. If Virginia Power’s
earnings are more than 50 basis points above the authorized level, such earnings will be shared with customers.

Virginia Power
previously filed with the Virginia Commission an application for approval and cost recovery of eleven DSM programs, including one peak-shaving program and ten energy efficiency programs. Virginia Power plans to use DSM, along with its traditional
and renewable supply-side resources, to meet its projected load growth over the next 15 years. The DSM programs provide the first steps toward achieving Virginia’s goal of reducing, by 2022, the electric energy consumption of Virginia
Power’s retail customers by ten percent of what was consumed in 2006. In March 2010, the Virginia Commission approved the recovery of approximately $28 million for five of the DSM programs through initiation of Riders C1 and C2, effective
May 1, 2010. With respect to the other six DSM programs for which approval was sought, the Virginia Commission made a finding that they were not in the public interest at that time, but allowed Virginia Power the opportunity for further
evaluation of similar programs. In July 2010, Virginia Power submitted its annual update filing for Riders C1 and C2 with respect to the five approved DSM programs. The proposed revenue requirements for Riders C1 and C2 were approximately $6 million
and $18 million, respectively, which together represent a decrease of approximately $5 million compared to the revenue requirements included in Riders C1 and C2 customer rates currently in effect. In February 2011, an evidentiary hearing was held by
the Virginia Commission on Virginia Power’s update of Riders C1 and C2. The Virginia Commission is required to issue its order by March 30, 2011. Virginia Power plans to seek Virginia Commission approval for several DSM programs in 2011.

In connection with the Bear Garden and Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center projects, in June 2010, Virginia Power filed annual
updates for Riders R and S, respectively, with the Virginia Commission. Initially, Virginia Power proposed an approximately $86 million revenue requirement for Rider R for the April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012 rate year. Due to the
application of accelerated tax depreciation provisions in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, passed in September 2010, Virginia Power revised the requested revenue requirement for Rider R in November 2010 from $86 million to $78 million. The
adjusted $78 million revenue requirement represents an increase of approximately $14 million over the revenue requirement associated with the Rider R customer rates currently in effect. The proposed Rider S revenue requirement, effective
April 1, 2011, for the rate year ending March 31, 2012 is approximately $200 million, which represents an increase of $46 million over the revenue requirement associated with the Rider S customer rates currently in effect. The ROE included
in both rider filings is 12.3%, consistent with the terms of the Virginia Settlement Approval Order. In July 2010, the Virginia Commission issued

orders with respect to Riders R and S, which adopted a placeholder ROE of 11.3% (not including the 100 basis point statutory enhancement) for use until the ROE is determined in the context of
Virginia Power’s upcoming biennial review. Evidentiary hearings were held by the Virginia Commission on Riders R and S in December and November 2010, respectively. The Virginia Commission is required to issue its orders on these proceedings by
March 30, 2011.

With respect to Virginia Power’s costs of transmission service, in June 2010, the Virginia Commission
approved Virginia Power’s annual update to Rider T which was effective September 1, 2010, reflecting the revenue requirement of approximately $338 million recommended by the Virginia Commission Staff and agreed to by Virginia Power. The
$338 million revenue requirement reflects an increase of approximately $118 million over the previous revenue requirement.

In
April 2010, Virginia Power filed its Virginia fuel factor application with the Virginia Commission. The application requested an annual decrease in fuel expense recovery of approximately $82 million for the period July 1, 2010 through
June 30, 2011. The proposed fuel factor went into effect on July 1, 2010 on an interim basis. An evidentiary hearing on Virginia Power’s application was held in September 2010, and in October 2010, the Virginia Commission issued its
final order approving the reduction in Virginia Power’s fuel factor as proposed in its application.

If the Virginia
Commission’s future rate decisions, including actions relating to Virginia Power’s upcoming biennial review and rate adjustment clause filings, differ materially from Virginia Power’s expectations, it could adversely affect its
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

North Carolina Regulation

Virginia Power’s North Carolina base rates have been subject to a five-year base rate moratorium, effective as of April 2005. Fuel rates continued to be subject to annual fuel rate adjustments, with
deferred fuel accounting for over- or under-recoveries of fuel costs.

In February 2010, in preparation for the end of the
five-year base rate moratorium, Virginia Power filed an application to increase its base rates and adjust its fuel rates. Virginia Power’s application included a proposal to recover proportionately more of its purchased power energy costs
through fuel rates, which are adjusted annually, instead of being recovered in base rates. In August 2010, Virginia Power filed its annual application for a change in its fuel rates, which updated the fuel application of February 2010 to reflect a
proposed decrease of approximately $28 million when compared to current fuel rates. Also in August 2010, Virginia Power updated its base rate application to seek a $27 million increase, instead of $29 million as originally proposed.

In September 2010, all parties to the base rate and fuel case except one, which did not oppose the settlement, filed an Agreement and
Stipulation of Settlement and requested approval from the North Carolina Commission. In December 2010, the North Carolina Commission issued the North Carolina Settlement Approval Order. The North Carolina Settlement Approval Order authorizes an
increase in base revenues of approximately $8 million and a one-year decrease in combined fuel revenues of approximately $32 million when compared to revenues produced from



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

current rates. In addition, the North Carolina Settlement Approval Order permits the recovery through fuel rates of 85% of the net energy costs of power purchases from both PJM and other
wholesale suppliers and from the non-utility generators subject to economic dispatch that do not provide actual cost data. The North Carolina Settlement Approval Order authorizes an ROE of 10.7% and a capital structure composed of 49% long-term debt
and 51% common equity. The new base and fuel rates became effective on January 1, 2011.

Ohio and West Virginia Regulation

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Ohio Commission approved an approximately $41 million annual revenue increase for East Ohio and a return on rate base
that incorporates an ROE of 10.38%. These changes were reflected in revised base rates commencing December 22, 2008.

In
October 2008, the Ohio Commission approved cost recovery for an initial five-year period of East Ohio’s 25-year PIR program to replace approximately 20% of its 21,000-mile pipeline system. In August 2010, East Ohio filed its second annual
application to adjust the cost recovery charge associated with its PIR program for actual costs and a return on investments made through June 30, 2010. The application reflected a revenue requirement of approximately $28 million. In November
2010, the Ohio Commission approved a settlement agreement filed by East Ohio and the Staff of the Ohio Commission reflecting a revenue requirement of approximately $27 million. Other interested parties to the case neither supported nor objected to
the settlement agreement.

Under the Ohio PIPP program, eligible customers can receive energy assistance based on their ability
to pay their bill. The difference between the customer’s total bill and the PIPP plan payment amount is deferred and collected under the PIPP rider in accordance with the rules of the Ohio Commission. Due to increased participation in the
program and increases in gas costs in the period since the previous rider rate went into effect, unrecovered costs increased. Accordingly, in March 2010, the Ohio Commission approved a 12-month recovery of approximately $259 million of uncollected
receivables associated with the PIPP program, comprised of accumulated PIPP arrearages of $163 million and projected arrearages of $96 million for the 12 months that the PIPP rider rate would be in effect. The PIPP rider rate went into effect
in April 2010. The Ohio Commission directed East Ohio to file an application, with arrearages calculated on a calendar year basis, to update its PIPP rider within one year of implementation of the new PIPP rider rate and annually thereafter.

In November 2010, rule changes adopted by the Ohio Commission to the PIPP program became effective. The rule changes
established a new program, PIPP Plus, which replaced PIPP. The PIPP Plus program reduces the customer’s monthly payments from 10% to 6% of household income and provides for forgiveness credits to the customer’s balance when required
payments are received in full by the due date. Such credits may result in the elimination of the customer’s arrearage balance over 24 months.

East Ohio files an annual UEX Rider with the Ohio Commission, pursuant to which it seeks recovery of the bad debt expense of most customers not participating in PIPP Plus. The UEX

Rider is adjusted annually to achieve dollar-for-dollar recovery of East Ohio’s actual write-offs of uncollectable amounts. In 2010, East Ohio deferred approximately $55 million of bad debt
expense for recovery through the UEX Rider.

In October 2008, Hope filed a request with the West Virginia Commission for an
increase in the base rates it charges for natural gas service. The requested new base rates would have increased Hope’s revenues by approximately $34 million annually. In November 2009, the West Virginia Commission authorized an approximately
$9 million increase in base rates. In June 2010, the West Virginia Commission authorized an additional base rate increase of less than $1 million to correct a miscalculation of rates attached to the November 2009 order.

Federal Regulation

In May 2005, FERC issued an
order finding that PJM’s existing transmission service rate design may not be just and reasonable, and ordered an investigation and hearings on the matter. In January 2008, FERC affirmed an earlier decision that the PJM transmission rate design
for existing facilities had not become unjust and unreasonable. For recovery of costs of investments of new PJM-planned transmission facilities that operate at or above 500 kV, FERC established a regional rate design where all customers pay a
uniform rate based on the costs of such investment. For recovery of costs of investment in new PJM-planned transmission facilities that operate below 500 kV, FERC affirmed its earlier decision to allocate costs on a beneficiary pays approach. A
notice of appeal of this decision was filed in February 2008 at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In August 2009, the court denied the petition for review concerning the rate design for existing facilities, but granted the petition
concerning the rate design for new facilities that operate at or above 500 kV, and remanded the issue of existing facilities back to FERC for further proceedings. Although Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the FERC
proceedings on remand, the impact of any PJM rate design changes on the Companies’ results of operations is not expected to be material.

In April 2008, FERC granted an application for Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual
basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January 1, 2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which
is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure.

In July 2008, Virginia Power filed an application with FERC requesting a revision to its revenue requirement to reflect an additional ROE incentive adder for eleven electric transmission enhancement
projects. Under the proposal, the cost of transmission service would increase to include an ROE incentive adder for each of the eleven projects, beginning the date each project enters commercial operation (but not before January 1, 2009).
Virginia Power proposed an incentive of 1.5% for four of the projects (including the Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun line and Carson-to-Suffolk line) and an incentive of 1.25% for the other seven projects. In August 2008, FERC approved the proposal,
effective September 1, 2008. The total cost for all eleven projects



is estimated at $877 million, and all projects are currently expected to be completed by 2012. Numerous parties sought rehearing of the FERC order in August 2008 and rehearing is pending.
Although Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the rehearing, it is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations.

In March 2010, ODEC and NCEMC filed a complaint with FERC against Virginia Power claiming that approximately $223 million in transmission costs related to specific projects were unjust, unreasonable and
unduly discriminatory or preferential and should be excluded from Virginia Power’s transmission formula rate. ODEC and NCEMC requested that FERC establish procedures to determine the amount of costs for each applicable project that should be
excluded from Virginia Power’s rates. In October 2010, FERC issued an order dismissing the complaint in part and established hearings and settlement procedures on the remaining part of the complaint. While Virginia Power cannot predict the
outcome of this proceeding, it is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations.

In May 2008, the RPM Buyers
filed a complaint with FERC claiming that PJM’s Reliability Pricing Model’s transitional auctions have produced unjust and unreasonable capacity prices. The RPM Buyers requested that a refund effective date of June 1, 2008 be
established and that FERC provide appropriate relief from unjust and unreasonable capacity charges within 15 months. In September 2008, FERC dismissed the complaint. The RPM Buyers requested rehearing of the FERC order in October 2008 and rehearing
was denied in June 2009. A notice of appeal was filed in August 2009 by the Maryland Public Service Commission and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In November 2009, the Court transferred
the appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In February 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the petition for review, concluding that FERC had adequately explained why the rates were just and reasonable.

Dominion and Virginia Power plan and operate their facilities in compliance with approved NERC reliability requirements. Dominion and
Virginia Power employees participate on various NERC committees, track the development and implementation of standards, and maintain proper compliance registration with NERC’s regional organizations. Dominion and Virginia Power anticipate
incurring additional compliance expenditures over the next several years as a result of the implementation of new cyber security programs as well as efforts to ensure appropriate facility ratings for Virginia Power’s transmission lines. In
October 2010, NERC issued an industry alert identifying possible discrepancies between the design and actual field conditions of transmission facilities as a potential reliability issue. The alert recommends that entities review their current
facilities rating methodology to verify that the methodology is based on actual field conditions, rather than solely on design documents, and to take corrective action if necessary. Virginia Power is evaluating its transmission facilities for any
discrepancies between design and actual field conditions.

In addition, NERC has requested the industry to increase the number of assets subject to NERC reliability standards that are designated as critical assets, including cyber security assets. While
Dominion and Virginia Power expect to incur additional compliance costs in connection with the above NERC requirements and initiatives, such expenses are not expected to significantly affect results of operations.

Dominion Transmission Rates

In December 2007, DTI
and the IOGA entered into a settlement agreement on DTI’s gathering and processing rates, which DTI and IOGA agreed in May 2010 to extend through December 31, 2014. DTI, at its option, may elect to extend the agreement for an additional
year through December 31, 2015. The settlement extension maintains the gas retainage fee structure that DTI has had since 2001. The rates are 10.5% for gathering and 0.5% for processing. Under the settlement, DTI continues to retain all
revenues from its liquids sales, thus maintaining cash flow from the liquids business. DTI will file the negotiated rates associated with the agreement extension with FERC in December 2011.

AROs represent obligations that result from laws, statutes, contracts and regulations related to the eventual retirement of certain of Dominion’s and
Virginia Power’s long-lived assets. Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s AROs are primarily associated with the decommissioning of their nuclear generation facilities. In addition, Dominion’s AROs include plugging and abandonment of
gas and oil wells, interim retirements of natural gas gathering, transmission, distribution and storage pipeline components, and the future abatement of asbestos expected to be disturbed in the Companies’ generation facilities.

The Companies have also identified, but not recognized, AROs related to retirement of Dominion’s LNG facility, Dominion’s gas
storage wells in its underground natural gas storage network, certain Virginia Power electric transmission and distribution assets located on property with easements, rights of way, franchises and lease agreements, Virginia Power’s
hydroelectric generation facilities and the abatement of certain asbestos not expected to be disturbed in the Companies’ generation facilities. The Companies currently do not have sufficient information to estimate a reasonable range of
expected retirement dates for any of these assets since the economic lives of these assets can be extended indefinitely through regular repair and maintenance and they currently have no plans to retire or dispose of any of these assets. As
a result, a settlement date is not determinable for these assets and AROs for these assets will not be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements until sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair
value of the activities to be performed. The Companies continue to monitor operational and strategic developments to

identify if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate a retirement date for these assets. The changes to AROs during 2009 and 2010 were as follows:

(1)

Includes $20 million, $9 million and $14 million reported in other current liabilities at December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively.

(2)

Primarily reflects updated decommissioning cost studies and applicable escalation rates received for the Companies’ nuclear facilities during the second quarter
of 2009. For Dominion, also includes a $103 million ($62 million after-tax) reduction in other operations and maintenance expense due to a downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a power station unit that is no longer in service.

(3)

Includes $2 million, $1 million and $3 million reported in other current liabilities at December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Dominion and Virginia Power have established trusts dedicated to funding the future decommissioning of their
nuclear plants. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the aggregate fair value of Dominion’s trusts, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities, totaled $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and
2009, the aggregate fair value of Virginia Power’s trusts, consisting primarily of debt and equity securities, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE and to disclose certain information about its significant variable interests in the
VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both 1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity
that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Virginia Power has long-term power and capacity contracts with four
non-utility generators with an aggregate generation capacity of approximately 974 MW. These contracts contain certain variable pricing mechanisms in the form of partial fuel reimbursement that Virginia Power considers to be variable interests. After
an evaluation of the information provided by these entities, Virginia Power was unable to determine whether they were VIEs. However, the information they provided, as well as Virginia Power’s knowledge of generation facilities in Virginia,
enabled Virginia Power to conclude that, if they were VIEs, it would not be the primary beneficiary. This conclusion reflects Virginia Power’s determination that its variable interests do not convey the power to direct the most significant
activities that impact the economic performance of the entities during the remaining terms of Virginia Power’s contracts and for the years the entities are expected to operate after its contractual relationships expire. The contracts expire at
various dates ranging from 2015 to 2021. Virginia Power is not subject to any risk of loss from these potential VIEs other than its remaining purchase commitments which totaled $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2010. Virginia Power paid $213
million, $210 million, and $205 million for electric capacity and $164 million, $117 million, and $196 million for electric energy to these entities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

As discussed in Note 25, DCI held an investment in the subordinated notes of a third-party CDO entity. Dominion previously concluded that
the CDO entity was a VIE and that DCI was the primary beneficiary of the CDO entity, which Dominion consolidated at December 31, 2007. In March 2008, Dominion entered into an agreement to sell its remaining interest in the subordinated notes
effectively eliminating the variability of its interest, and therefore deconsolidated the CDO entity as of March 31, 2008.

Virginia Power purchased shared services from DRS, an affiliated VIE, of approximately $465 million, $416 million, and $397 million for
the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Virginia Power determined that it is not the most closely associated entity with DRS and therefore not the primary beneficiary. DRS provides accounting, legal, finance and certain
administrative and technical services to all Dominion subsidiaries, including Virginia Power. Virginia Power has no obligation to absorb more than its allocated share of DRS costs.

Dominion and Virginia Power use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to
long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters
of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion’s credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties. Dominion and Virginia Power replaced certain of their

Based on stated maturity dates rather than early redemption dates that could be elected by instrument holders, the scheduled principal

Dominion’s and Virginia
Power’s short-term credit facilities and long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions. As of December 31, 2010, there were no events of default under these covenants.

Convertible Securities

At December 31, 2010, Dominion had $202 million of outstanding contingent convertible senior notes that are convertible by holders into a combination of cash and shares of Dominion’s common
stock under certain circumstances. The conversion feature requires that the principal amount of each note be repaid in cash, while amounts payable in excess of the principal amount will be paid in common stock. At issuance, the notes were valued at
a conversion rate of 27.173 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of senior notes, which represented a conversion price of $36.80. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon certain events such as subdivisions, splits,
combinations of common stock or the issuance to all common stock holders of certain common stock rights, warrants or options and certain dividend increases. As of December 31, 2010, the conversion rate had been adjusted to 28.5032 shares,
primarily due to individual dividend payments above the level paid at issuance.

The number of shares included in the
denominator of the diluted EPS calculation is calculated as the net shares issuable for the reporting period based upon the average market price for the period. This results in an increase in the average shares outstanding used in the calculation of
Dominion’s diluted EPS when the conversion price is lower than the average market price of Dominion’s common stock over the period, and results in no adjustment when the conversion price exceeds the average market price.

The senior notes are convertible by holders into a combination of cash and shares of Dominion’s common stock under any of the
following circumstances:

(1)

The closing price of Dominion’s common stock equals 120% of the applicable conversion price or higher for at least 20 out of the last 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter;

(2)

The senior notes are called for redemption by Dominion;

(3)

The occurrence of specified corporate transactions; or

(4)

The credit rating assigned to the senior notes by Moody’s is below Baa3 and by Standard & Poor’s is below BBB- or the ratings are discontinued for
any reason.

During the first three quarters of 2010, the senior notes were not eligible for
conversion. However, as of September 30, 2010, the closing price of Dominion’s common stock was equal to $42.24 per share or higher for at least 20 out of the last 30 consecutive trading days; therefore, the senior notes were eligible for
conversion during the fourth quarter of 2010. During 2010, less than $1 million of the contingent convertible senior notes were converted by holders. The senior notes were not eligible for conversion during 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the
closing price of Dominion’s common stock was not equal to $42.10 per share or higher for at least 20 out of the last 30 consecutive trading days; therefore, the senior notes are not eligible for conversion during the first quarter of 2011.
Beginning in 2007, the notes have been eligible for contingent interest if the average trading price as defined in the indenture equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the senior notes. Holders have the right to require Dominion to
purchase these senior notes for cash at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in December 2011, 2013 or 2018, or if Dominion undergoes certain fundamental changes.

Junior Subordinated Notes Payable to Affiliated Trusts

In previous years, Dominion and Virginia
Power established several subsidiary capital trusts, each as a finance subsidiary of the respective parent company, which hold 100% of the voting interests. The trusts sold trust preferred securities representing preferred beneficial interests and
97% beneficial ownership in the assets held by the trusts. In exchange for the funds realized from the sale of the trust preferred securities and common securities that represent the remaining 3% beneficial ownership interest in the assets held by
the capital trusts, Dominion and Virginia Power issued various junior subordinated notes. The junior subordinated notes constitute 100% of each capital trust’s assets. Each trust must redeem its trust preferred securities when their respective
junior subordinated notes are repaid at maturity or if redeemed prior to maturity.

In May 2008, Virginia Power repaid its
$412 million 7.375% unsecured junior subordinated notes and redeemed all 16 million units of the $400 million 7.375% Virginia Power Capital Trust II



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

preferred securities due July 30, 2042. These securities were redeemed at a price of $25 per preferred security plus accrued and unpaid distributions.

The following table provides summary information about the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes outstanding as of
December 31, 2010:

Junior subordinated notes/debentures held as assets by each capital trust were as follows:

(1)

$258 million—Dominion Resources, Inc. 7.83% Debentures due 12/1/2027.

(2)

$10 million—Dominion Resources, Inc. 8.4% Debentures due 1/15/2031.

The following table presents interest charges related to the Companies’ junior subordinated notes payable to affiliated trusts:

Distribution payments on the trust preferred securities are considered to be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the respective parent company that issued the debt instruments held by each trust when
all of the related agreements are taken into consideration. Each guarantee agreement only provides for the guarantee of distribution payments on the relevant trust preferred securities to the extent that the trust has funds legally and immediately
available to make distributions. The trust’s ability to pay amounts when they are due on the trust preferred securities is dependent solely upon the payment of amounts by Dominion when they are due on the junior subordinated notes. Dominion may
defer interest payments on the junior subordinated notes on one or more occasions for up to five consecutive years and the related trusts must also defer distributions. If the payment on the junior subordinated notes is deferred, Dominion may not
make distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments. Also, during any deferral period, Dominion may not make any payments on, redeem or repurchase any debt
securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the junior subordinated notes.

Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes

In June 2006 and September 2006, Dominion issued $300 million of June 2006 hybrids and $500 million of September 2006 hybrids,
respectively. The June 2006 hybrids will bear interest at 7.5% per year until June 30, 2016. Thereafter, they will bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.825%, reset quarterly. The September 2006 hybrids will bear interest at
6.3% per year until September 30, 2011. Thereafter, they will bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.3%, reset quarterly.

In June 2009, Dominion issued $685 million (including $60 million related to the
underwriter’s option to purchase additional notes to cover over-allotments) of 8.375% June 2009 hybrids. The June 2009 hybrids are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DRU.

In April 2010, Dominion purchased and cancelled $16 million of the September 2006 hybrids. These purchases were conducted in compliance
with the RCCs.

Dominion may defer interest payments on the hybrids on one or more occasions for up to 10 consecutive years. If
the interest payments on the hybrids are deferred, Dominion may not make distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments. Also, during the deferral period,
Dominion may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the hybrids.

Repurchase of Common Stock

In March 2010, Dominion began repurchasing common shares in anticipation of proceeds from the sale of its Appalachian E&P operations. During 2010, Dominion repurchased 21.4 million shares of its
common stock for approximately $900 million.

On January 28, 2011, Dominion announced that it intends to repurchase between
$400 million and $700 million of common stock with cash tax savings resulting from the extension of the bonus depreciation allowance discussed in Note 6. In the first quarter of 2011, Dominion began repurchasing shares on the open market under this
program.

Stock-Based Awards

The 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan permits stock-based awards that include restricted stock, performance grants, goal-based stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. The Non-Employee
Directors Plan permits grants of restricted stock and stock options. Under provisions of both plans, employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase common stock at a price not less than its fair market value at the date of
grant with a maximum term of eight years. Option terms are set at the discretion of the CGN Committee of the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors itself, as provided under each plan. At December 31, 2010, approximately
33 million shares were available for future grants under these plans.

Dominion measures and recognizes compensation
expense relating to share-based payment transactions over the vesting period based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Dominion’s results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 include $40
million, $44 million, and $46 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $15 million, $17 million, and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to Dominion’s stock-based compensation arrangements. Stock-based compensation
cost is reported in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for stock-based compensation (excess tax benefits) are
classified as a financing cash flow. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Dominion realized $10 million, $5 million, and $7 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits from the vesting of restricted stock awards and
exercise of stock options.

Goal-based stock awards have been granted to key contributors who are non-officer employees and to certain officers, who have not achieved a certain targeted level of share ownership, in lieu of
cash-based performance grants. Current outstanding goal-based shares include awards granted in February 2009, April 2009 and February 2010.

The issuance of awards is based on the achievement of multiple performance metrics during a two-year period, including ROIC, BVP (for awards made in 2008 and 2009) and TSR relative to that of a peer group
of companies. The actual number of

shares issued will vary between zero and 200% of targeted shares depending on the level of performance metrics achieved. The fair value of goal-based stock is equal to the market price of
Dominion’s stock on the date of grant. Goal-based stock awards granted to key non-officer employees convert to restricted stock at the end of the two-year performance period and generally vest three years from the original grant date. Awards to
officers vest at the end of the two-year performance period. All goal-based stock awards are settled by issuing new shares.

After the performance period for the April 2007 grants ended on December 31, 2008, the CGN Committee determined the actual
performance against metrics established for those awards. For awards to key non-officer employees, 127 thousand shares of the outstanding goal-based stock awards granted in April 2007 were converted to 185 thousand shares of restricted
stock for the remaining term of the vesting period ending in April 2010. For awards to officers, 27 thousand shares of the outstanding goal-based stock awards were converted to 38 thousand non-restricted shares and issued to the officers.

After the performance period for the April 2008 grants ended on December 31, 2009, the CGN Committee determined the
actual performance against metrics established for those awards. For awards to key non-officer employees, 147 thousand shares of the outstanding goal-based stock awards granted in April 2008 were converted to 186 thousand shares of
restricted stock for the remaining term of the vesting period ending in April 2011. For awards to officers, 12 thousand shares of the outstanding goal-based stock awards were converted to 15 thousand non-restricted shares and issued to the
officers.

The following table provides a summary of goal-based stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2010,
2009 and 2008:

At December 31, 2010, the targeted number of shares expected to be issued under the February 2009, April 2009, and February 2010 awards was approximately 161 thousand. In January 2011, the CGN
Committee determined the actual performance against metrics established for the February 2009 and April



2009 awards with a performance period that ended December 31, 2010. Based on that determination, the total number of shares to be issued under the goal-based stock awards was approximately
202 thousand.

As of December 31, 2010, unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested goal-based stock awards
totaled $2 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years.

accrued for this award.

In February 2009, a cash-based performance grant was made to officers. A portion of the grant,
representing the $11 million targeted amount as of December 31, 2010, was paid in December 2010, based on the achievement of three performance metrics during 2009 and 2010: ROIC, BVP and TSR relative to that of a peer group of companies. The total
expected award under the grant is $14 million and the remaining portion of the grant will be paid by March 15, 2011. At December 31, 2010, a liability of $3 million had been accrued for the remaining portion of the award.

In February 2010, a cash-based performance grant was made to officers. Payout of the performance grant will occur by March 15, 2012
based on the achievement of two performance metrics during 2010 and 2011: ROIC and TSR relative to that of a peer group of companies. At December 31, 2010, the targeted amount of the grant was $12 million and a liability of $6 million had been

Dominion provides certain
benefits to eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. Under the terms of its benefit plans, Dominion reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plans. From time to time in the past, benefits have changed, and some of
these changes have reduced benefits.

Dominion maintains qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering
virtually all employees. Retirement benefits are based primarily on years of service, age and the employee’s compensation. Dominion’s funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with the provisions of ERISA.
The pension program also provides benefits to certain retired executives under a company-sponsored nonqualified employee benefit plan. The nonqualified plan is funded through contributions to a grantor trust.

Dominion provides retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits with annual employee premiums based on several factors such as age,
retirement date and years of service. In January 2011, Dominion amended its retiree healthcare and life benefits to change the eligibility age for the majority of nonunion employees from 55 with 10 years of service to 58 with 10 years of service,
resulting in an approximately $71 million reduction to the other postretirement benefit plan obligation. The eligibility requirements for nonunion employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, who benefit under the Retiree Medical Account
design, as well as for union employees are not affected by this plan design change.

Pension and other postretirement benefit
costs are affected by employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and years of service), the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. These costs may also be affected by changes in key assumptions,
including expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and the rate of compensation increases.

Dominion uses December 31 as the measurement date for all of its employee benefit plans. Dominion uses the market-related value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets,
a component of net periodic pension cost. The market-related value recognizes changes in fair value on a straight-line basis over a four-year period, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Changes in fair value are measured as the difference between
the expected and actual plan asset returns, including dividends, interest and realized and unrealized investment gains and losses. Since the market-related value recognizes changes in fair value over a four-year period, the future market-related
value of pension plan assets will be impacted as previously unrecognized changes in fair value are recognized.

Dominion’s
pension and other postretirement benefit plans hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Aggregate actual returns for Dominion’s pension and other postretirement plan assets were $624 million in 2010 and $777 million in
2009, versus expected returns of $479 million and $462 million, respectively. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these
trusts will result in future increases in the periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

The Medicare Act introduced a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit
plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Dominion determined that the prescription drug benefit offered under its other postretirement benefit plans is at least actuarially equivalent
to Medicare Part D. In 2010 and 2009, Dominion received a federal subsidy of $5 million and $4 million, respectively, and expects to continue to receive the subsidy offered under the Medicare Act.

The following table summarizes the changes in Dominion’s pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan obligations and plan
assets and includes a statement of the plans’ funded status:

The ABO for all of Dominion’s defined benefit
pension plans was $4.1 billion and $3.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Under its funding policies,
Dominion evaluates plan funding requirements annually, usually in the fourth quarter after receiving updated plan information from its actuary. Based on the funded status of each plan and other factors, Dominion determines the amount of
contributions for the current year, if any, at that time. During 2010, Dominion contributed $650 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans. No contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans are currently expected in 2011.
Certain regulatory authorities have held that amounts recovered in utility customers’ rates for other postretirement benefits, in excess of benefits actually paid during the year, must be deposited in trust funds dedicated for the sole purpose
of paying such benefits. Accordingly, certain of Dominion’s subsidiaries fund other postretirement benefit costs through VEBAs. Dominion’s remaining subsidiaries do not prefund other postretirement benefit costs but instead pay claims as
presented. Dominion expects to contribute approximately $22 million to the Dominion VEBAs in 2011.

Dominion does not expect
any pension or other postretirement plan assets to be returned to the Company during 2011.

The following table provides
information on the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for plans with a benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are
expected to be paid:

The above benefit payments for other postretirement benefit plans are expected to be offset by Medicare Part D subsidies of approximately $6 million each in 2011 and 2012, $7 million each in 2013 and
2014, $8 million in 2015 and $50 million during the period 2016 through 2020.

Dominion’s overall objective for investing
its pension and other postretirement plan assets is to achieve the best possible long-term rates of return commensurate with prudent levels of risk. To minimize risk, funds are broadly diversified among asset classes, investment strategies and
investment advisors. The strategic target asset allocations for its pension funds are 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 33% fixed income, 3% real estate and 18% other alternative investments. U.S. equity includes investments in large-cap,
mid-cap and small-cap companies

located in the United States. Non-U.S. equity includes investments in large-cap companies located outside of the United States including both developed and emerging markets. Fixed income includes
corporate debt instruments of companies from diversified industries and U.S. Treasuries. The U.S. equity, non-U.S. equity and fixed income investments are in individual securities as well as mutual funds. Real estate includes equity REITs and
investments in partnerships. Other alternative investments include partnership investments in private equity, debt and hedge funds that follow several different strategies.

Strategic investment policies are established for each of Dominion’s prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include
employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans’ strategic allocation are a function of Dominion’s
assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans’ actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic
rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Financial derivatives may be used to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities.

respectively, are included in AOCI, with the remainder included in regulatory assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, of the $1.8 billion and $235 million related to pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, $1 billion and
$87 million, respectively, are included in AOCI, with the remainder included in regulatory assets and liabilities.

The following table provides the components of AOCI and regulatory assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2010 that are expected to be amortized as components of periodic benefit cost in 2011:

Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for its pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:

•

Historical return analysis to determine expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations;

•

Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indices;

•

Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; and

•

Investment allocation of plan assets.

Dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of other independent investment advisors to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions.

Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its
plans.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
Dominion’s retiree healthcare plans. A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects:

In addition, Dominion sponsors defined contribution employee savings plans. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, Dominion recognized $39 million, $42 million and $39 million, respectively, as contributions to
these plans.

Virginia Power participates in a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by Dominion. Benefits payable under the plan are based primarily on years of service, age and the employee’s compensation. As a
participating employer, Virginia Power is subject to Dominion’s funding policy, which is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with the provisions of ERISA. During 2010, Virginia Power contributed $302 million to the defined
benefit pension plan. Virginia Power’s net periodic pension cost related to this pension plan was $84 million, $48 million and $32 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 net periodic pension cost includes the impact of a
settlement and curtailment as well as a one-time special termination benefit for certain employees in connection with a workforce reduction program. Employee compensation is the basis for determining Virginia Power’s share of total pension
costs.

Virginia Power participates in a plan that provides certain retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits to multiple
Dominion subsidiaries. Annual employee premiums are based on several factors such as age, retirement date and years of service. Virginia Power’s net periodic benefit cost related to this plan was $59 million, $55 million and $33 million in
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Employee headcount is the basis for determining Virginia Power’s share of total other postretirement benefit costs.

Certain regulatory authorities have held that amounts recovered in rates for other postretirement benefits, in excess of benefits actually paid during the year, must be deposited in trust funds dedicated
for the sole purpose of paying such benefits. Accordingly, Virginia Power funds other postretirement benefit costs through a VEBA. Virginia Power’s contributions to the VEBA were $35 million, $34 million and $15 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. Virginia Power expects to contribute approximately $4 million to the VEBA in 2011.

Dominion holds investments in
trusts to fund employee benefit payments for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, in which Virginia Power’s employees participate. Any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the periodic
cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of



cash that Virginia Power will provide to Dominion for its share of employee benefit plan contributions.

Virginia Power also participates in Dominion-sponsored defined contribution employee savings plans that cover substantially all employees. Employer matching contributions of $14 million were incurred in
each of 2010, 2009 and 2008.

ONTINGENCIES

As the result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, Dominion and Virginia Power are involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings
before various courts, regulatory commissions and governmental agencies, some of which involve substantial amounts of money. The ultimate outcome of such proceedings cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically
reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Long-Term Purchase Agreements

At
December 31, 2010, Virginia Power had the following long-term commitments that are noncancelable or are cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the
contracted goods or services:

Commitments represent estimated amounts payable for capacity under power purchase contracts with qualifying facilities and independent power producers, the last of
which ends in 2021. Capacity payments under the contracts are generally based on fixed dollar amounts per month, subject to escalation using broad-based economic indices. At December 31, 2010, the present value of Virginia Power’s
total commitment for capacity payments is $1.8 billion. Capacity payments totaled $344 million, $356 million, and $379 million, and energy payments totaled $303 million, $254 million, and $372 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Lease Commitments

Dominion and Virginia Power lease various facilities, vehicles and equipment primarily under operating leases. Payments under certain leases are escalated
based on an index such as the consumer price index. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and capital leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:

Rental expense for Dominion totaled $171 million, $172 million, and $160 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Rental expense for Virginia Power totaled $50 million, $49
mil-

lion, and $39 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The majority of rental expense is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense.

Dominion leases Fairless, which began commercial operations in June 2004. During construction, Dominion acted as the construction agent
for the lessor, controlled the design and construction of the facility and has since been reimbursed for all project costs ($898 million) advanced to the lessor. Dominion makes annual lease payments of $53 million that are reflected in the lease
commitments table. The lease expires in 2013 and at that time, Dominion may renew the lease at negotiated amounts based on original project costs and current market conditions, subject to lessor approval; purchase Fairless at its original
construction cost plus 51% of any appraised value in excess of original construction cost; or sell Fairless, on behalf of the lessor, to an independent third party. If Fairless is sold and the proceeds from the sale are less than its original
construction cost, Dominion would be required to make a payment to the lessor in an amount up to 70.75% of the original project costs adjusted for certain other costs as specified in the lease. The lease agreement does not contain any provisions
that involve credit rating or stock price trigger events.

Environmental Matters

Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations
affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.

The CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of
regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation’s air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are
more restrictive. Many of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s facilities are subject to the CAA’s permitting and other requirements.

In May 2010, Dominion received a request for information pursuant to Section 114 of the CAA from the EPA. The request concerns historical operating changes and capital improvements undertaken at
Brayton Point and Salem Harbor. Dominion submitted its response to this request in November 2010 and cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

In February 2008, Dominion received a request for information pursuant to Section 114 of the CAA from the EPA. The request concerns historical operating changes and capital improvements undertaken at
State Line and Kincaid. In April 2009, Dominion received a second request for information. Dominion provided information in response to both requests. Also in April 2009, Dominion received a Notice and Finding of Violations from the EPA claiming
violations of the CAA New Source Review requirements, New Source Performance Standards, the Title V permit program and the stations’ respective State Implementation Plans. The Notice states that the EPA may issue an order requiring compliance
with the relevant CAA provisions and may seek injunctive relief and/or civil penalties, all pursuant to the EPA’s enforcement



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

authority under the CAA. Dominion cannot predict the outcome of this matter. However, an adverse resolution could have a material effect on future results of operations and/or cash flows.

In March 2005, the EPA promulgated regulations finalizing CAIR and CAMR. In February 2008, the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling vacating CAMR. The EPA is proceeding with the development of a MACT rulemaking for coal and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. These rules could require significant reductions in mercury
and other HAPs from electric generation facilities. It should be noted that Dominion continues to be governed by individual state mercury emission reduction regulations in Massachusetts and Illinois that were largely unaffected by the CAMR ruling.

In July 2008, the Court issued a ruling vacating CAIR. In December 2008, the Court denied rehearing, but
also issued a decision to remand CAIR to the EPA. The CAIR rules remain in effect until such time that the EPA develops and implements new rulemaking addressing the issues identified by the Court. In July 2010, the EPA announced a proposed new rule,
called the Transport Rule, which will eventually replace CAIR, and, as proposed, requires significant reductions in
SO


and NO

X

emissions.

The EPA has finalized rules establishing a new 1-hour NAAQS for NO


(January 2010) and a new 1-hour NAAQS for SO


(June 2010), which could require additional NO

X

and SO


controls in certain areas where the Companies operate. Until the states have developed implementation plans for these
standards, the impact on Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s facilities that emit NO

X

and SO


is
uncertain. However, based on a preliminary assessment, Dominion has determined that the new 1-hour SO


NAAQS will likely require significant future capital expenditures at State Line, and, accordingly, recorded an impairment charge on this facility in the second quarter of 2010. In January 2010, the EPA
also proposed a new, more stringent NAAQS for ozone. Until the rulemaking for the Transport Rule is complete and the states have developed implementation plans for the new NO


, SO


and ozone standards, it is not possible to determine the impact on Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s facilities
that emit NO

X

and SO


. The Companies cannot currently predict with certainty whether or
to what extent the new rules will ultimately require additional controls, however, if significant expenditures are required, it could adversely affect Dominion’s results of operations, and Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s cash flows.

In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to the Regional Haze Rule, also known as the Clean Air Visibility Rule. Although
Dominion and Virginia Power anticipate that the emission reductions achieved through compliance with other CAA required programs will generally address this rule, additional emission reduction requirements may be imposed on the Companies’
facilities.

Implementation of projects to comply with SO

and mercury limitations, and other state emission control programs are ongoing and will be influenced by changes in the
regulatory environment, availability of emission allowances and emission control technology. In response to federal and state regulatory requirements, Dominion and Virginia Power estimate that they will make capital expenditures at their affected
generating facilities of approximately $2.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, during the period 2011 through 2015.

In December 2010, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality approved an air permit
to construct the power station development project in Warren County, Virginia. In connection with the air permit process, Virginia Power reached an agreement with the National Park Service to permanently retire the North Branch power station, a 74
MW coal fired plant located in West Virginia, once the Warren County power station begins commercial operations.

In June 2010,
the Conservation Law Foundation and Healthlink, Inc., filed a Complaint in the District Court of Massachusetts against Dominion Energy New England, Inc. alleging that Salem Harbor units 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been and are in violation of visible
emissions standards and monitoring requirements of the Massachusetts State Implementation Plan and the station’s state and federal operating permits. Although Dominion cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time, it is not expected
to have a material effect on results of operations.

In June 2008, the Virginia State Air Pollution Control Board approved and
issued an air permit to construct and operate the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center and also approved and issued another air permit for hazardous emissions. Construction of the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center commenced and the facility is
expected to be in operation by 2012. In August 2008, SELC, on behalf of four environmental groups, filed Petitions for Appeal in Richmond Circuit Court challenging the approval of both of the air permits. The Richmond Circuit Court issued an Order
in September 2009 upholding the initial air permit and upholding the second air permit for hazardous emissions except for one condition related to the permit limit for mercury emissions. In September 2009, the hazardous emissions air permit was
amended by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality to comply with the Richmond Circuit Court Order. The permit amendment does not impact the project. In October 2009, SELC filed a Notice of Appeal of the court’s Order regarding the
initial air permit with the Richmond Circuit Court, initiating the appeals process to the Virginia Court of Appeals. In May 2010, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court’s opinion in the appeal of the Virginia City Hybrid Energy
Center’s air permit. SELC did not further appeal the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court of Virginia.

The CWA is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate
discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. Dominion and Virginia Power must comply with all aspects of the CWA programs at their operating facilities. In July 2004, the EPA published regulations under CWA Section 316b that
govern existing utilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold. The EPA’s rule presented several compliance options. However, in January 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit issued a decision on an appeal of the regulations, remanding the rule to the EPA. In July 2007, the EPA suspended the regulations pending further rulemaking, consistent with the decision issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. In November 2007, a number of industries appealed the lower court decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. In April 2008, the



U.S. Supreme Court granted the industry request to review the question of whether Section 316b of the CWA authorizes the EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology
available for minimizing “adverse environmental impact” at cooling water intake structures. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in April 2009 that the EPA has the authority to consider costs versus environmental benefits in selecting best
technology available for reducing impacts of cooling water intakes at power stations. It is currently unknown how the EPA will interpret the ruling in its ongoing rulemaking activity addressing cooling water intakes as well as how the states will
implement this decision. Dominion has sixteen facilities, including eight at Virginia Power, that are likely to be subject to these regulations. In November 2010, the EPA settled with the original litigants and agreed to publish a proposed rule no
later than March 14, 2011 and a final rule no later than July 27, 2012. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the EPA regulatory processes, nor can they determine with any certainty what specific controls may be
required.

In August 2006, the CDEP issued a notice of a Tentative Determination to renew the NPDES permit for Millstone, which
included a draft copy of the revised permit. In October 2007, CDEP issued a report to the hearing officer for the tentative determination stating the agency’s intent to further revise the draft permit. In December 2007, the CDEP issued a new
draft permit. An administrative hearing on the draft permit began in January 2009 and was completed in February 2009. In February 2010, the hearing officer issued a proposed final decision, recommending that the CDEP Commissioner issue the revised
draft permit without change. In September 2010, the permit was reissued under the CWA. The conditions of the permit require an evaluation of control technologies that could result in additional expenditures in the future, however Dominion cannot
currently predict the outcome of this evaluation. In October 2010, the permit issuance was appealed to the state court by a private plaintiff. The permit is expected to remain in effect during the appeal.

In October 2003, the EPA and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection each issued new NPDES permits for Brayton Point. The
new permits contained identical conditions that in effect require the installation of cooling towers to address concerns over the withdrawal and discharge of cooling water. Currently, Dominion estimates the total cost to install these cooling towers
at approximately $600 million, with remaining expenditures of $354 million included in its planned capital expenditures through 2012.

In October 2007, the VSWCB issued a renewed VPDES permit for North Anna. BREDL, and other persons, appealed the VSWCB’s decision to the Richmond Circuit Court, challenging several permit provisions
related to North Anna’s discharge of cooling water. In February 2009, the court ruled that the VSWCB was required to regulate the thermal discharge from North Anna into the waste heat treatment facility. Virginia Power filed a motion for
reconsideration with the court in February 2009, which was denied. The final order was issued by the court in September 2009. The court’s order allows North Anna to continue to operate pursuant to the currently issued VPDES permit. In October
2009, Virginia Power filed a Notice of Appeal of the court’s Order with the Richmond Circuit Court, initiating the appeals process to the Virginia Court of Appeals. In June 2010,

the Virginia Court of Appeals reversed the Richmond Circuit Court’s September 2009 order. The Virginia Court of Appeals held that the lower court had applied the wrong standard of review,
and that the VSWCB’s determination not to regulate the station’s thermal discharge into the waste heat treatment facility was lawful. In July 2010, BREDL and the other original appellants filed a petition for appeal to the Supreme
Court of Virginia requesting that it review the Court of Appeals’ decision. In December 2010, the Supreme Court of Virginia granted BREDL’s petition. Briefing on the merits of the case will occur during the first quarter of 2011.
Until the appeals process is complete and any revised permit is issued, it is not possible to predict with certainty any financial impact that may result, however, an adverse resolution could have a material effect on Virginia Power’s cash
flows.

The CERCLA, as amended, provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous
substances into the environment and authorizes the U.S. government either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under the
CERCLA as amended, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of contaminated sites, can be strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup. These potentially responsible
parties can be ordered to perform a cleanup, be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, voluntarily settle with the U.S. government concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or voluntarily begin a site investigation and site
remediation under state oversight.

From time to time, Dominion or Virginia Power may be identified as a potentially
responsible party to a Superfund site. The EPA (or a state) can either allow such a party to conduct and pay for a remedial investigation, feasibility study and remedial action or conduct the remedial investigation and action itself and then seek
reimbursement from the potentially responsible parties. Each party can be held jointly, severally and strictly liable for the cleanup costs. These parties can also bring contribution actions against each other and seek reimbursement from their
insurance companies. As a result, Dominion or Virginia Power may be responsible for the costs of remedial investigation and actions under the Superfund law or other laws or regulations regarding the remediation of waste. The Companies do not believe
that any currently identified sites will result in significant liabilities.

Dominion has determined that it is associated with
17 former manufactured gas plant sites. Studies conducted by other utilities at their former manufactured gas plant sites have indicated that those sites contain coal tar and other potentially harmful materials. None of the 17 former sites with
which Dominion is associated is under investigation by any state or federal environmental agency. At one of the former sites Dominion is conducting a state-approved post closure groundwater monitoring program and an environmental land use
restriction has been recorded. Another site has been accepted into a state-based voluntary remediation program and Dominion has not yet estimated the future remediation costs. It is not known to what degree the other former sites may contain
environmental contamination. Dominion



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

is not able to estimate the cost, if any, that may be required for the possible remediation of these other sites.

In June 2010, the EPA proposed federal regulations under the RCRA for management of coal combustion by-products generated by power plants. The EPA is considering two possible options for the regulation of
coal combustion by-products, both of which fall under the RCRA. Under the first proposal, the EPA would classify these by-products as special wastes subject to regulation under subtitle C, the hazardous waste provisions of the RCRA, when destined
for disposal at landfills or surface impoundments. Under the second proposal, the EPA would regulate coal combustion by-products under subtitle D of the RCRA, the section for non-hazardous wastes. While the Companies cannot currently predict the
outcome of this matter, regulation under either option will affect Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s onsite disposal facilities and coal combustion by-product management practices, and potentially require material investments.

EGULATION

In December 2009, the EPA issued their

Final Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean
Air Act

, finding that GHGs “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” On April 1, 2010, the EPA and the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Safety Administration
announced a joint final rule establishing a program that will dramatically reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy for new cars and trucks sold in the United States. These rules took effect in January 2011 and established GHG emissions as
regulated pollutants under the CAA. In May 2010, the EPA issued the

Final Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule

that, combined with these prior actions, will require Dominion and Virginia Power to
obtain permits for GHG emissions for new and modified facilities over certain size thresholds, and meet best available control technology for GHG emissions beginning in 2011. The EPA has issued draft guidance for GHG permitting, including best
available control technology. EPA has also announced a schedule for proposing regulations of GHG emissions under the New Source Performance Standards that would apply to new and existing electric generating units. Also, the Companies expect
continued regulatory action at the state level on the regulation of GHG emissions in the future. Any of these new or contemplated regulations above may affect capital costs, or create significant permitting delays, for new or modified facilities
that emit GHGs.

There are other legislative proposals that may be considered that would have an indirect impact on GHG
emissions. There is the potential for the Congress to consider a mandatory Clean Energy Standard or to promote greater energy efficiency through early retirements of coal-fired power plants.

In addition to possible federal action, some regions and states in which Dominion and Virginia Power operate have already adopted or may
adopt GHG emission reduction programs. For example, the Virginia Energy Plan, released by the Governor of Virginia in September 2007, includes a goal of reducing GHG emissions state-wide back to 2000 levels by 2025. The Governor formed a Commission
on Climate Change to develop a plan to achieve this goal. In November 2008, the Commission formulated its recommendations to the Governor.

In July 2008, Massachusetts passed the GWSA. Among other provisions, the GWSA sets
economy-wide GHG emissions reduction goals for Massachusetts, including reductions of 10% to 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, interim goals for 2030 and 2040 and reductions of 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Regulations requiring the implementation of
the GWSA have not yet been proposed. Dominion operates two coal/oil-fired generating power stations in Massachusetts and acts as a retail electric supplier in Massachusetts and all of these entities are subject to the implementation of the GWSA.

Additionally, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, among other states, have joined the RGGI, a
multi-state effort to reduce CO


emissions in the Northeast
implemented through state specific regulations. Under the initiative, aggregate CO


emissions from power plants in participating states are required to be stabilized at current levels from 2009 to 2015. Further reductions from current levels would be required to be phased in starting in
2016 such that by 2019 there would be a 10% reduction in participating state power plant CO


emissions. During 2011 and possibly continuing through 2012, RGGI will undergo a program review which could impact regulations and implementation of RGGI. The impact of this program review on
Dominion’s fossil fired generation operations in RGGI states is unknown at this time.

Three of
Dominion’s facilities, Brayton Point, Salem Harbor and Manchester Street, are subject to RGGI. Beginning with calendar year 2009, RGGI requires that Dominion cover each ton of CO


direct stack emissions from these facilities with either an allowance or an offset. The allowances can be purchased
through auction or through a secondary market. Dominion participated in RGGI allowance auctions to date and has procured allowances to meet its estimated compliance requirements under RGGI for 2009 and 2010 and partially for 2011. Dominion does not
expect these allowances to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition.

In December 2009, the
governors of 11 Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, including Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island (RGGI states plus Pennsylvania) signed a memorandum of understanding committing their states toward
developing a low carbon fuel standard to reduce GHG emissions from vehicles. The memorandum of understanding establishes a process to develop a regional framework by 2011 and examine the economic impacts of a low carbon fuel standard program.

The U.S. is currently not a party to the Kyoto Protocol, which is a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change that became effective for signatories on February 16, 2005. The Kyoto Protocol process generally requires developed countries to cap GHG emissions at certain levels during the 2008-2012 time period. At the conclusion of the
December 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, the Copenhagen Accord was adopted, which includes a collection of non-binding, voluntary actions by various countries, including the U.S, to keep the increase in global
mean temperature below 2 degrees Celsius. It does not include specific emissions targets, but calls for industrial nations to offer up emissions reduction targets for 2020. The U.S. is expected to participate in this process.

The NRC requires nuclear power plant owners to annually update minimum financial assurance amounts for the future decommissioning of their nuclear facilities. The 2010 calculation for the NRC minimum
financial assurance amount, aggregated for Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear units, was $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and has been satisfied by a combination of the funds being collected and deposited in the nuclear
decommissioning trusts and the real annual rate of return growth of the funds allowed by the NRC. The 2010 NRC minimum financial assurance amounts shown were calculated using September 30, 2010 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indices. The final
NRC minimum financial assurance amounts that will be filed with the NRC in March 2011 will most likely be based on December 31, 2010 indices. Dominion does not anticipate a material difference between the NRC minimum financial assurance amounts
shown and the final NRC minimum financial amounts to be filed with the NRC. Dominion believes that the amounts currently available in its decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs
for the Millstone and Kewaunee units. Virginia Power also believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and
contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns as the units will not be decommissioned for decades. Dominion and
Virginia Power will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the minimum financial assurance requirement, which may include the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial guarantees recognized by the NRC.

NSURANCE

The Price-Anderson Act provides the public up to $12.6 billion of liability protection per nuclear incident via obligations required of owners of nuclear power plants. The Price-Anderson Amendments Act of
1988 allows for an inflationary provision adjustment every five years. Dominion and Virginia Power have purchased $375 million of coverage from commercial insurance pools for each reactor site with the remainder provided through a mandatory industry
risk-sharing program. In the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear reactor in the U.S., the Companies could be assessed up to $118 million for each of their licensed reactors not to exceed $18 million per year per reactor. There is no
limit to the number of incidents for which this retrospective premium can be assessed.

The current level of property insurance
coverage for Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear units is as follows:

The Companies’ coverage exceeds the NRC minimum requirement for nuclear power plant
licensees of $1.06 billion per reactor site and includes coverage for premature decommissioning and functional total loss. The NRC requires that the proceeds from this insurance be used first, to return the reactor to and maintain it in a safe and
stable condition and second, to decontaminate the reactor and station site in accordance with a plan approved by the NRC. Nuclear property insurance is provided by NEIL, a mutual insurance company, and is subject to retrospective premium assessments
in any policy year in which losses exceed the funds available to the insurance company. Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s maximum retrospective premium assessment for the current policy period is $77 million and $39 million, respectively.
Based on the severity of the incident, the board of directors of the nuclear insurer has the discretion to lower or eliminate the maximum retrospective premium assessment. Dominion and Virginia Power have the financial responsibility for any losses
that exceed the limits or for which insurance proceeds are not available because they must first be used for stabilization and decontamination.

Dominion and Virginia Power also purchase insurance from NEIL to mitigate certain expenses, including replacement power costs, associated with the prolonged outage of a nuclear unit due to direct physical
damage. Under this program, the Companies are subject to a retrospective premium assessment for any policy year in which losses exceed funds available to NEIL. Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s maximum retrospective premium assessment for
the current policy period is $32 million and $18 million, respectively.

ODEC, a part owner of North Anna, and Massachusetts
Municipal Wholesale Electric Company and Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, part owners of Millstone’s Unit 3, are responsible to Dominion and Virginia Power for their share of the nuclear decommissioning obligation and insurance
premiums on applicable units, including any retrospective premium assessments and any losses not covered by insurance.

Under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Dominion and Virginia Power entered
into contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin accepting the spent fuel on January 31, 1998, the date provided by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and by the Companies’ contracts with the DOE. In
January 2004, Dominion and Virginia Power filed lawsuits in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the DOE requesting damages in connection with its failure to commence accepting spent nuclear fuel. A trial occurred in May 2008 and post-trial
briefing and argument concluded in July 2008. On October 15, 2008, the Court issued an opinion and order for Dominion in the amount of approximately $155 million, which includes approximately $112 million in damages incurred by Virginia Power
for spent fuel-related costs at its Surry and North Anna power stations and approximately $43 million in damages incurred for spent nuclear fuel-related costs at Dominion’s Millstone power station through June 30, 2006. Judgment was
entered by the Court on October 28, 2008. In December 2008, the government appealed the judgment to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the appeal was docketed. In March 2009, the Federal Circuit granted the government’s



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

request to stay the appeal. In May 2010, the stay was lifted, and the government’s initial brief in the appeal was filed in June 2010. The issues raised by the government on appeal pertain
to the damages awarded to Dominion for Millstone. The government did not take issue with the damages awarded to Virginia Power for Surry or North Anna. As a result, Virginia Power recognized a receivable in the amount of $174 million, largely offset
against property, plant and equipment and regulatory assets and liabilities, representing certain spent nuclear fuel-related costs incurred through June 30, 2010. Briefing on the appeal was concluded in September 2010 and oral argument took place
before the Federal Circuit in January 2011. Payment of any damages will not occur until the appeal process has been resolved.

A lawsuit was also filed for Kewaunee. In August 2010, Dominion and the federal government reached a settlement resolving Dominion’s
claims for damages incurred at Kewaunee through December 31, 2008. The approximately $21 million settlement payment was received in September 2010.

The Companies will continue to manage their spent fuel until it is accepted by the DOE.

Virginia Power and Kewaunee continue to recognize receivables for certain spent nuclear fuel-related costs that are probable of recovery from the DOE.

Guarantees, Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit

D

OMINION

At
December 31, 2010, Dominion had issued $131 million of guarantees, primarily to support equity method investees. No significant amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded. As of December 31, 2010, Dominion’s
exposure under these guarantees was $54 million, primarily related to certain reserve requirements associated with non-recourse financing. During the first quarter of 2010, Dominion’s $165 million limited-scope guarantee and indemnification for
one-half of NedPower’s project-level financing, relating to litigation seeking to halt the NedPower wind farm, was formally terminated with the consent of NedPower’s lenders as a result of the dismissal by the applicable court of such
litigation pursuant to an agreed dismissal order.

In addition to the above guarantees, Dominion and its partners, Shell and
BP, may be required to make additional periodic equity contributions to NedPower and Fowler Ridge in connection with certain funding requirements associated with their respective non-recourse financings. As of December 31, 2010, Dominion’s
maximum remaining cumulative exposure under these equity funding agreements is $144 million through 2019 and its maximum annual future contributions could range from approximately $16 million to $19 million. Dominion expects the operating cash flows
from these projects to be sufficient to meet their financing requirements.

Dominion also enters into guarantee arrangements on
behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries, primarily to facilitate their commercial transactions with third parties. To the extent that a liability subject to a guarantee has been incurred by one of Dominion’s consolidated subsidiaries, that
liability is included in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion is not required to recognize liabilities for guarantees issued on behalf of its subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that it will have to perform under the guarantees. Terms
of the guarantees typically end once

obligations have been paid. Dominion currently believes it is unlikely that it would be required to perform or otherwise incur any losses associated with guarantees of its subsidiaries’
obligations.

At December 31, 2010, Dominion had issued the following subsidiary guarantees:

(1)

Represents the estimated portion of the guarantee’s stated limit that is utilized as of December 31, 2010 based upon prevailing economic conditions
and fact patterns specific to each guarantee arrangement. For those guarantees related to obligations that are recorded as liabilities by Dominion’s subsidiaries, the value includes the recorded amount.

(2)

Guarantees of debt of certain DEI subsidiaries. In the event of default by the subsidiaries, Dominion would be obligated to repay such amounts.

(3)

Guarantees related to energy trading and marketing activities and other commodity commitments of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiaries of Virginia Power and
DEI. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, oil, electricity, pipeline capacity, transportation and related commodities and services. If any of these subsidiaries fail to
perform or pay under the contracts and the counterparties seek performance or payment, Dominion would be obligated to satisfy such obligation. Dominion and its subsidiaries receive similar guarantees as collateral for credit extended to others. The
value provided includes certain guarantees that do not have stated limits.

(4)

Guarantee of a DEI subsidiary’s leasing obligation for Fairless.

(5)

Guarantees related to certain DEI subsidiaries’ potential retrospective premiums that could be assessed if there is a nuclear incident under Dominion’s
nuclear insurance programs and guarantees for a DEI subsidiary’s and Virginia Power’s commitment to buy nuclear fuel. Excludes Dominion’s agreement to provide up to $150 million and $60 million to two DEI subsidiaries to pay the
operating expenses of Millstone and Kewaunee, respectively, in the event of a prolonged outage, as part of satisfying certain NRC requirements concerned with ensuring adequate funding for the operations of nuclear power stations.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2010 Dominion had purchased $87 million of surety bonds and
authorized the issuance of standby letters of credit by financial institutions of $136 million to facilitate commercial transactions by its subsidiaries with third parties. Under the terms of surety bonds, Dominion is obligated to indemnify the
respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.

As of December 31, 2010, Virginia Power had issued $16 million of guarantees primarily to support tax-exempt debt issued through conduits.
Virginia Power had also purchased $39 million of surety bonds for various purposes, including providing workers’ compensation coverage, and authorized the issuance of standby letters of credit by financial institutions of $91 million to
facilitate commercial transactions by its subsidiaries with third parties. Under the terms of surety bonds, Virginia Power is obligated to indemnify the respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.

Indemnifications

As part of commercial contract
negotiations in the normal course of business, Dominion and Virginia Power may sometimes agree



to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may involve an adverse
judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretation of the tax law. Dominion and Virginia Power are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these
contracts because events that would obligate them have not yet occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence. However, at December 31, 2010, Dominion and Virginia Power believe future payments,
if any, that could ultimately become payable under these contract provisions, would not have a material impact on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Workforce Reduction Program

In the first quarter of 2010, Dominion and Virginia Power announced a
workforce reduction program that reduced their total workforces by approximately 9% and 11%, respectively, during 2010. The goal of the workforce reduction program was to reduce operations and maintenance expense growth and further improve the
efficiency of the Companies. In the first quarter of 2010, Dominion recorded a $338 million ($206 million after-tax) charge, including $202 million ($123 million after-tax) at Virginia Power, primarily reflected in other operations and maintenance
expense in their Consolidated Statements of Income due to severance pay and other benefits related to the workforce reduction program. During 2010, Dominion and Virginia Power paid $109 million and $104 million, respectively, of costs related to the
program. The terms of the workforce reduction program were consistent with the Companies’ existing severance plan.

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if counterparties fail to perform their contractual obligations. In order to minimize overall credit risk, credit policies are maintained, including the
evaluation of counterparty financial condition, collateral requirements and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition, counterparties may make available
collateral, including letters of credit or cash held as margin deposits, as a result of exceeding agreed-upon credit limits, or may be required to prepay the transaction.

Dominion and Virginia Power maintain a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of their customers, historical trends and other information. Management believes, based on
credit policies and the December 31, 2010 provision for credit losses, that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

As a diversified energy
company, Dominion transacts primarily with major companies in the energy industry and with commercial and residential energy consumers. These transactions principally occur in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S. and Texas.
Dominion does not believe that this
geo-

graphic concentration contributes significantly to its overall exposure to credit risk. In addition, as a result of its large and diverse customer base, Dominion is not exposed to a significant
concentration of credit risk for receivables arising from electric and gas utility operations.

Dominion’s exposure to
credit risk is concentrated primarily within its energy marketing and price risk management activities, as Dominion transacts with a smaller, less diverse group of counterparties and transactions may involve large notional volumes and potentially
volatile commodity prices. Energy marketing and price risk management activities include trading of energy-related commodities, marketing of merchant generation output, structured transactions and the use of financial contracts for enterprise-wide
hedging purposes. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross credit exposure is calculated prior
to the application of collateral. At December 31, 2010, Dominion’s gross credit exposure totaled $620 million. After the application of collateral, credit exposure is reduced to $591 million. Of this amount, investment grade
counterparties, including those internally rated, represented 85%. One counterparty exposure represents 10% of Dominion’s total exposure and is a large financial institution rated investment grade.

Virginia Power sells electricity and provides distribution and transmission services to customers in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Management
believes that this geographic concentration risk is mitigated by the diversity of Virginia Power’s customer base, which includes residential, commercial and industrial customers, as well as rural electric cooperatives and municipalities. Credit
risk associated with trade accounts receivable from energy consumers is limited due to the large number of customers. Virginia Power’s exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from sales to wholesale customers.

beneficiary of the CDO entity and therefore Dominion consolidated the CDO entity at December 31, 2007.

In March 2008,
Dominion reached an agreement to sell its remaining interest in the subordinated notes to a third party, effectively eliminating the variability of its interest, and therefore deconsolidated the CDO entity as of March 31, 2008 and recognized
impairment losses of $62 million ($38 million after-tax), which were recorded in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income. In connection with the sale of the subordinated notes, in April 2008, Dominion
received proceeds of $54 million, including accrued interest. This sale concluded Dominion’s efforts to divest of DCI, since its remaining assets are aligned with Dominion’s core business.

Management of Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) understands and accepts responsibility for Dominion’s financial statements and related disclosures and the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting (internal control). Dominion continuously strives to identify opportunities to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control, just as Dominion does throughout all aspects of its business.

Dominion maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that its assets are
safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with established procedures. This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to ensure
appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and internal audits.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Dominion, composed entirely of independent
directors, meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to discuss auditing, internal control, and financial reporting matters of Dominion and to ensure that each is properly
discharging its responsibilities. Both the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit Committee and have free access to the Committee at any time.

SEC rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require Dominion’s 2010 Annual Report to contain a
management’s report and a report of the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of internal control. As a basis for the report, Dominion tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal
controls. Based on its assessment as of December 31, 2010, Dominion makes the following assertion:

Management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting of Dominion.

There are
inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

Management evaluated Dominion’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, Management believes that Dominion maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Dominion Resources, Inc.

Richmond, Virginia

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Dominion Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Dominion”) as of
December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Dominion’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Dominion’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Dominion maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2010 of Dominion and our report dated February 25, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

ISCUSSION

AND

NALYSIS

Virginia Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion. Virginia Power’s Board is comprised of Messrs. Farrell, McGettrick and Rogers. Messrs. Farrell and McGettrick are not independent because they
are executive officers of Virginia Power. Mr. Rogers is not deemed independent because of his employment with Dominion. Virginia Power’s Board believes that it is more appropriate for its compensation program to be managed under the
direction of individuals who are independent and, therefore, Virginia Power does not have a compensation committee. Instead, Virginia Power’s Board depends on the advice and recommendations of Dominion’s CGN Committee, which is comprised
of independent directors and which retained the consulting firm of PM&P to advise the committee on compensation



matters. Virginia Power’s Board approves all compensation paid to executive officers based on the CGN Committee’s recommendations. None of Virginia Power’s directors receive any
compensation for services they provide as directors.

Because the CGN Committee effectively administers one compensation
program for all of Dominion, the following discussion and analysis is based on Dominion’s overall compensation program.

I

NTRODUCTION

This
CD&A provides a detailed explanation of the objectives and principles that underlie Dominion’s executive compensation program, its elements and the way performance is measured, evaluated and rewarded. It also describes Dominion’s
compensation decision-making process. Dominion’s executive compensation program is designed to pay for performance and played an important role in the company’s success in 2010 by linking a significant amount of compensation to the
achievement of performance goals.

The program and processes generally apply to all officers, but this discussion and analysis
focuses primarily on compensation for the NEOs of Virginia Power. During 2010, Virginia Power’s NEOs were:

Ÿ

Thomas F. Farrell II, Chairman, President and CEO

Ÿ

Mark F. McGettrick, Executive Vice President and CFO

Ÿ

Paul D. Koonce, President and COO—DVP

Ÿ

David A. Christian, President and COO—Generation

Ÿ

James F. Stutts, Senior Vice President and General Counsel

(retired January 1, 2011)

The CGN Committee determines the compensation payable to officers of Dominion and its wholly-owned subsidiaries on an aggregate basis,
taking into account all services performed by the officers, whether for Dominion or one or more of its subsidiaries. For the NEOs included in Dominion’s annual proxy statement, these aggregate amounts are reported in the Summary Compensation
Table and related executive compensation tables. For purposes of reporting each NEO’s compensation from Virginia Power in the Summary Compensation Table (and related tables that follow) in this Item 11, the aggregate compensation for each
NEO is pro-rated based on the ratio of services performed by the NEO for Virginia Power to the NEO’s total services performed for all of Dominion. For officers who are NEOs of both Virginia Power and Dominion, the amounts reported in the tables
below are part of, and not in addition to the aggregate compensation amounts that are reported for these NEOs in Dominion’s 2011 Proxy Statement. The CD&A below discusses the CGN Committee’s decisions with respect to each NEO’s
aggregate compensation for all services performed for all of Dominion, not just the pro-rata portion attributable to the NEO’s services for Virginia Power.

Objectives

The major objectives of Dominion’s compensation program are to:

Ÿ

Attract, develop and retain an experienced and highly qualified management team;

Ÿ

Motivate and reward superior performance that supports the business and strategic plans and contributes to the long-term success of the company;

Ÿ

Align the interests of management with those of Dominion’s shareholders by placing a substantial portion of pay at risk through performance goals
that, if achieved, are expected to increase total shareholder return;

Ÿ

Promote internal pay equity; and

Ÿ

Reinforce Dominion’s core values of safety, ethics, excellence and “One Dominion” – Dominion’s term for teamwork.

These objectives provide the framework for the compensation decisions. To determine if Dominion is meeting
the objectives of its compensation program, the CGN Committee reviews and compares Dominion’s actual performance to its short-term and long-term goals, strategies, and peer companies’ performance.

Dominion’s 2010 performance indicates that the design of Dominion’s compensation program is meeting these objectives. The NEOs
have service with Dominion ranging from 12 to 34 years. Dominion has attracted, motivated and maintained a superior leadership team with skills, industry knowledge and institutional experience that strengthen their ability to act as sound stewards
of Dominion’s shareholder dollars. Dominion is performing well relative to its internal goals and as compared to its peers.

The CGN Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving NEO compensation and the overall executive compensation
program. Each year, the CGN Committee reviews and considers a comprehensive assessment and analysis of the executive compensation program, including the elements of each NEO’s compensation, with input from management and the independent
compensation consultant. As part of its assessment, the CGN Committee reviews the performance of the CEO and other executive officers, meets at least annually with the CEO to discuss succession planning for his position and the positions of the
company’s senior officers, reviews the share ownership guidelines and executive officer compliance with the guidelines, and establishes compensation programs designed to achieve Dominion’s objectives.

The CGN Committee’s practice has been to retain an independent compensation
consultant, PM&P, to advise the committee on executive and director compensation matters. PM&P does not provide any services to Dominion other than its consulting services to the CGN Committee related to executive and director compensation.
The PM&P consultant participates in meetings with the CGN Committee, either in person or by teleconference, and communicates directly with the chairman of the committee outside of the committee meetings as requested by the chairman of the
committee. PM&P also reviewed meeting materials for the CGN Committee and provided the following services related to the 2010 executive compensation program:

Ÿ

Provided independent advice to the CGN Committee regarding the appropriateness of Dominion’s peer group;

Ÿ

Participated in CGN Committee executive sessions without management present to discuss CEO compensation and any other relevant matters, including the
appropriate relationship between pay and performance and emerging trends, to answer technical questions, and to review and comment on management proposals and analyses of peer group compensation data; and

Ÿ

Generally reviewed and offered advice as requested by or on behalf of the CGN Committee regarding other aspects of the executive compensation program,
including special awards, best practices and other matters.

Although the CGN Committee has
the responsibility to approve and monitor all compensation for the NEOs, management plays an important role in determining executive compensation. Under the direction of the Corporate Secretary, internal compensation specialists provide the CGN
Committee with data, analysis and counsel regarding the executive compensation program, including an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of the program, peer practices, and executive compensation trends and best practices. The CEO, CFO and
Corporate Secretary, along with the internal compensation and financial specialists, assist in the design of the incentive compensation plans, including performance target recommendations consistent with the strategic goals of the company, and in
establishing the peer group. Management also works with the Chairman of the CGN Committee to establish the agenda and prepare meeting information for each committee meeting.

On an annual basis, the CEO is responsible for reviewing with the CGN Committee Dominion’s succession plans for his own position and for Dominion’s senior officers. He is also responsible for
reviewing the performance of his senior officers, including the other NEOs, with the CGN Committee at least annually. He makes recommendations on the compensation and benefits for the NEOs (other than himself) to the CGN Committee and provides other
information and counsel as appropriate or as requested by the CGN Committee, but all decisions are ultimately made by the CGN Committee.

OMPARISONS

Each year, the CGN Committee approves a peer group of companies. In selecting the peer group, Dominion uses a methodology recommended by
PM&P to identify companies in the industry

that compete for customers, executive talent and investment capital. Dominion screens this group based on size and usually eliminates companies that are much smaller or larger than
Dominion’s size in revenues, assets and market capitalization. Dominion also considers the geographic locations and the regulatory environment in which potential peer companies operate.

Dominion’s peer group is generally consistent from year to year, with merger and acquisition activity being the primary reason for
any changes. The 2010 peer group was the same as the 2009 peer group and consisted of the following 14 energy companies:

Ameren Corporation

American Electric Power
Company, Inc.

Constellation Energy Group, Inc.

DTE Energy
Company

Duke Energy Corporation

Entergy
Corporation

Exelon Corporation

FirstEnergy Corp.

NextEra Energy, Inc. (formerly FPL Group, Inc.)

NiSource, Inc.

PPL Corporation

Progress Energy, Inc.

Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.

Southern
Company

The CGN Committee, PM&P and management use peer company data to: (i) compare Dominion’s
stock and financial performance against its peers using a number of different metrics and time periods to evaluate how Dominion is performing as compared to its peers; (ii) analyze compensation practices within the industry; (iii) evaluate
peer company practices and determine peer median and 75th percentile ranges for base pay, annual incentive pay, long-term incentive pay, total direct compensation generally and for specific positions; and (iv) compare Employment Continuity
Agreements and other benefits. In setting the levels for base pay, annual incentive pay, long-term incentive pay and total direct compensation, the CGN Committee also takes into consideration Dominion’s larger size compared with the median of
the peer group.

During 2009 and 2010, survey compensation data was used only to provide a general understanding of compensation practices and trends. Dominion did not benchmark or otherwise use broad-based market data as
the basis for 2009 or 2010 compensation decisions for the NEOs and other senior officers. Going forward, the CGN Committee intends to continue its practice of emphasizing individual and company specific considerations, including internal pay equity,
along with peer company data in establishing compensation opportunities. The CGN Committee believes that this emphasis better reflects Dominion’s specific needs in its distinct competitive market and with respect to its size and complexity
versus its peers.

Management, including Dominion’s chief risk officer and other executives, annually reviews the overall structure of Dominion’s executive
compensation program and policies to ensure they are consistent with effective management of enterprise key risks and that they do not encourage executives to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could threaten the value of the enterprise. With
respect to the programs and policies that apply to the NEOs, this review includes:

Ÿ

Analysis of how different elements of the compensation programs may increase or mitigate risk-taking;



Ÿ

Analysis of performance metrics used for short-term and long-term incentive programs and the relation of such incentives to the objectives of Dominion;

Ÿ

Analysis of whether the performance measurement periods for short-term and long-term incentive compensation are appropriate; and

Ÿ

Analysis of the overall structure of compensation programs as related to business risks.

Among the factors considered in management’s assessment are: the balance of the overall program design, including the mix of cash
and equity compensation; the mix of fixed and variable compensation; the balance of short-term and long-term objectives of incentive compensation; the performance metrics, performance targets, threshold performance requirements and capped payouts
related to incentive compensation; the clawback provision on incentive compensation; Dominion’s share ownership guidelines, including share ownership levels and retention practices; prohibitions on hedging, pledging, and other derivative
transactions related to Dominion stock; and internal controls and oversight structures in place.

Management reviewed and
discussed the results of this assessment with the CGN Committee. Based on this review, the CGN Committee believes Dominion’s well-balanced mix of salary and short-term and long-term incentives, as well as the performance

metrics that are included in the incentive programs, are appropriate and consistent with Dominion’s risk management practices and overall strategies.

The CGN Committee uses a number of tools in its annual review of the compensation of the CEO and other NEOs, including charts illustrating the total range
of payouts for each performance-based compensation element under a number of different scenarios; spreadsheets showing the cumulative dollar impact on total direct compensation that could result from implementing proposals on any single element of
compensation; graphs showing the relationship between the CEO’s pay and that of the next highest-paid officer and NEOs as a group; and other information the CGN Committee may request in its discretion. Management’s internal compensation
specialists provide the CGN Committee with detailed comparisons of the design and features of Dominion’s long-term incentive and other executive benefit programs with available information regarding similar programs at the peer companies. These
tools are used as part of the overall process to ensure that the program results in appropriate pay relationships as compared to Dominion’s peer companies and internally among the NEOs, and that an appropriate balance of at-risk,
performance-based compensation is maintained to support the program’s core objectives.

ROGRAM

The executive compensation program consists of four basic elements:

Factors in Setting Compensation

As part of the process of setting compensation targets, approving payouts and designing future programs, the CGN Committee evaluates Dominion’s overall performance versus its business plans and
strategies, its short-term and long-term goals and the performance of its peer companies. In addition to considering Dominion’s overall performance for the year, the CGN
Commit-

tee takes into consideration several individual factors that are not given any specific weighting in setting each element of compensation for each NEO, including:

Ÿ

An officer’s experience and job performance;

Ÿ

The scope, complexity and significance of responsibility for a position, including any differences from peer company positions;



Ÿ

Internal pay equity considerations, such as the relative importance of a particular position or individual officer to Dominion’s strategy and
success, and comparability to other officer positions at Dominion;

Ÿ

Retention and market competitive concerns; and

Ÿ

The officer’s role in any succession plan for other key positions.

The CGN Committee evaluates each NEO’s base salary, total cash and total direct compensation opportunities against peer group data,
both at peer group median and the 75th percentile, to ensure the compensation levels are appropriately competitive, but except for base salary, does not target these compensation levels at a particular percentile or range of the peer group data.
Base salary is generally targeted at or slightly above the peer group 50th percentile (median). Compensation decisions are based on what the CGN Committee deems appropriate, taking into consideration a number of factors, including those discussed
above. However, actual compensation targets may range from below peer median to at or above the 75th percentile based on a number of factors including experience, tenure and internal pay equity considerations. As part of this analysis, the CGN
Committee also takes into account Dominion’s larger size and complexity compared to its peer companies.

In setting
compensation for 2010, due to volatile market conditions and budget considerations, base salaries were generally maintained at the 2009 levels for all officers, including all NEOs, and adjustments were made to performance-based compensation target
levels for certain officers. Based on the review of peer company compensation data, each NEO’s job performance, and internal pay equity considerations such as scope and complexity of the position relative to other positions at the company, the
CGN Committee determined it was appropriate to increase the target levels under the annual incentive plan for Messrs. McGettrick and Christian and for all of the NEOs under the long-term incentive program, as described below in Base Salary, Annual
Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Program.

CEO Compensation Relative to Other NEOs

Mr. Farrell participates in the same compensation programs and receives compensation based on the same philosophy and factors as other NEOs. Application of the same philosophy and factors to
Mr. Farrell’s position results in overall CEO compensation that is significantly higher than the compensation of the other NEOs. His compensation is commensurate with his greater responsibilities and decision-making authority, broader
scope of duties that encompasses the entirety of the company (as compared to the other NEOs who are responsible for significant but distinct areas within the company) and his overall responsibility for corporate strategy. His compensation also
reflects his role as the primary corporate representative to investors, customers, regulators, analysts, legislators, industry and the media.

Dominion considers CEO compensation trends as compared to the next highest-paid officer as well as to other executive officers as a group, over a multi-year period to monitor the ratio of
Mr. Farrell’s pay relative to the pay of other executive officers based on (i) salary only and (ii) total direct compensation. Dominion also compares its ratios to that of its peers to confirm that its ratios are consistent with
practices at the peer companies. There is no particular targeted ratio or goal, but instead the CGN

Committee considers year-to-year trends and comparisons with peer companies. The CGN Committee did not make any adjustments to the compensation of any NEOs based on this review in 2010.

Allocation of Total Direct Compensation in 2010

Consistent with Dominion’s objective to reward strong performance based on the achievement of short-term and long-term goals, a significant portion of total cash and total direct compensation is at
risk. Approximately 88% of Mr. Farrell’s targeted 2010 total direct compensation is performance-based, tied to pre-approved performance metrics or tied to the performance of Dominion’s stock. For the other NEOs, performance-based and
stock-based compensation ranges from 71% to 79% of targeted 2010 total direct compensation. This compares to an average of approximately 53% of targeted compensation at risk for most officers at the vice president level and an average of
approximately 12% of total pay at risk for non-officer employees.

The charts below illustrate the elements of total direct
compensation opportunities in 2010 for Mr. Farrell and the other NEOs as a group and the allocation of such compensation among base salary, targeted 2010 annual incentive plan award and targeted 2010 long-term incentive compensation.

*

Chart does not include the restricted stock grant made to Mr. Farrell for strategic and retention purposes in December 2010, as discussed under Other Restricted
Stock Grant.

Base Salary

Base salary compensates officers, along with the rest of the work force, for committing significant time to working on Dominion’s behalf. Annual salary reviews achieve two primary purposes:
(i) an annual adjustment, as appropriate, to keep salaries in line and



competitive with the peer group and to reflect changes in responsibility, including promotions; and (ii) a motivational tool to acknowledge and reward excellent individual performance,
special skills, experience, the strategic impact of a position relative to other executives and other relevant considerations.

The primary goal is to compensate its officers at a level that best achieves its objectives and reflects the considerations discussed
above. Dominion believes that an overall goal of targeting base salary at or slightly above the peer group median is a conservative but appropriate target for base pay. However, an individual’s compensation may be below or above Dominion’s
target range based on a number of factors such as performance, tenure, and other factors explained above in

Factors in Setting Compensation

. In addition to being ranked above the peer group median in 2010 in terms of revenues, assets and
market capitalization, the scope of Dominion’s business operations is complex and unique in its industry. Successfully managing such a broad and complex business requires a skilled and experienced management team. Dominion believes it would not
be able to successfully recruit and retain such a team if the base pay for officers was generally below the peer group median.

Although individual and company performance would have supported merit increases for 2010 for the NEOs, due to uncertain market conditions
and the current economic climate, the CGN Committee froze base salaries for most officers, including all NEOs at their 2009 levels.

In September 2010, the CGN Committee considered Dominion’s exceptional performance year-to-date and determined it was appropriate to authorize a one-time, 2% merit lump sum payment to all employees
(other than those whose compensation is determined pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement). This 2% merit lump sum payment was also paid to all NEOs. The 2% merit lump sum payment was within the range of general market increases
for 2010 merit awards, based on Dominion’s understanding of compensation practices and trends. As a special one-time lump sum payment, however, the payment did not increase base salaries or change compensation levels used in calculating
retirement plan and other employee benefits.

Annual Incentive Plan

O

VERVIEW

The AIP plays an important role in meeting Dominion’s overall
objective of rewarding strong performance. The AIP is a cash-based program focused on short-term goal accomplishments and is designed to:

Ÿ

Tie interests of Dominion’s shareholders and employees closely together;

Ÿ

Focus the workforce on company, operating group, team and individual goals that ultimately influence operational and financial results;

Ÿ

Reward corporate and operating unit earnings performance;

Ÿ

Reward safety and other operating and stewardship goal success;

Ÿ

Emphasize teamwork by focusing on common goals;

Ÿ

Appropriately balance risk and reward; and

Ÿ

Provide a competitive total compensation opportunity.

T

ARGET

A

WARDS

An NEO’s compensation opportunity under
the AIP is based on a target award. Target awards are determined as a percentage of a

participant’s base salary (for example, 95% of base salary). The target award is the amount of cash that will be paid if a participant achieves a score of 100% for the goals established at
the beginning of the year and the plan is funded at the full funding target set for the year. Participants who retire during the plan year are eligible to receive a pro-rated payment of their AIP award after the end of the plan year based on final
funding and goal achievement. Participants who terminate employment during the plan year and who are not eligible to retire (before attainment of age 55) forfeit their AIP award.

AIP target award levels are established based on a number of factors, including historical practice, individual and company performance
and internal pay equity considerations, and are compared against peer group data to ensure the appropriate competitiveness of an NEO’s total cash compensation opportunity. However, as discussed above, AIP target award levels are not targeted at
a specific percentile or range of the peer group data, nor was market survey data used in setting AIP target award levels for 2010. Annual incentive target award levels were also consistent with the intent to have a significant portion of NEO
compensation at risk. The 2010 AIP targets for the NEOs, as a percentage of their base salary, are shown below and as compared to their 2009 targets.

* As a % of base salary

The 2010 AIP targets for Messrs. Farrell, Koonce and Stutts were the same as their 2009 AIP targets at 125%, 90% and 80% of base salary,
respectively.

Mr. McGettrick transitioned from the role of CEO of the Dominion Generation business unit to CFO of
Dominion in 2009, but he did not receive an increase in his AIP target in 2009 when he became Dominion’s CFO. Due to Mr. McGettrick’s increased responsibility as Dominion’s CFO, Mr. McGettrick’s 2010 AIP target
increased from 95% to 100%. Similarly, Mr. Christian’s AIP target did not increase in 2009 when he transitioned from CNO to CEO of the Generation business unit. Due to the increased scope of responsibility in his new position, the CGN
Committee determined it was appropriate to increase the AIP target for 2010 from 80% to 85% for Mr. Christian.

F

UNDING

OF

THE

2010 AIP

Funding of the 2010 AIP was based solely on consolidated operating earnings per share, with
potential funding ranging from 0% to 200% of the target funding. Consolidated operating earnings are Dominion’s reported earnings determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for certain items. Dominion believes that by placing a focus on
pre-established consolidated operating earnings per share targets, it increases employee awareness of the company’s financial objectives and encourages behavior and performance that will help achieve these objectives.

The 2010 AIP had a full funding target of $3.30 consolidated operating earnings per share, the approximate mid-point of



Dominion’s 2010 earnings guidance announced in January 2010. Funding is based on a formula that provides proportionate sharing of consolidated operating earnings between AIP participants and
shareholders until the full funding target is achieved. Consolidated operating earnings above the full funding target of $3.30 operating earnings per share are shared equally with shareholders, up to the maximum AIP funding level of 200% at $3.40
operating earnings per share.

Full funding means that the AIP is 100% funded and participants can receive their full
targeted AIP payout if they achieve a score of 100% for their particular goal package, as described below in

How AIP Payouts

Are Determined

. At the maximum plan funding level of 200%, participants can earn up to two times their
targeted AIP payout, subject to achievement of their individual goal packages.

Dominion’s consolidated operating
earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $1.97 billion, or $3.34 per share, as compared to its consolidated reported earnings in accordance with GAAP of $2.81 billion or $4.76 per share.* This resulted in 134% funding for the
2010 AIP.

*

Reconciliation of 2010 Consolidated Operating Earnings to Reported Earnings.

The
following items, which are net of tax, are included in Dominion’s 2010 reported earnings, but are excluded from consolidated operating earnings: $1.4 billion net benefit from the sale of Appalachian E&P operations, $206 million charge
related to a workforce reduction program, $155 million net loss from the discontinued operations and loss on sale of Peoples, $127 million impairment charge related to certain merchant generation facilities, $57 million charge related to health care
legislation changes, and $1 million net expense related to other items.

For most officers other than the NEOs, payout of their funded AIP awards for 2010 was subject
to the accomplishment of business unit financial and operating and stewardship goals, including a safety goal. The percentage allocated to each category of goals represents the percentage of the funded award subject to the
per-

formance of that goal. Officer goals are weighted according to their responsibilities. The overall score cannot exceed 100% scoring.

Business unit financial goals provide a line-of-sight performance target for officers within a business unit and, on a combined basis,
support the consolidated operating earnings target for Dominion. Operating and stewardship goals provide line-of-sight performance targets that may not be financial and that can be customized for each individual or by segments of each business unit.
Operating and stewardship goals promote Dominion’s core values of safety, ethics, excellence and teamwork, which in turn contribute to Dominion’s financial success.

The AIP is designed so that AIP payouts earned by the NEOs will qualify as tax deductible “performance-based” compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). To
preserve the tax deduction for payouts made to the NEOs whose compensation is subject to Code Section 162(m), their payout, if any, is contingent solely on the achievement of the consolidated financial goal (weighted 100%). If the consolidated
financial goal is met, the CGN Committee has the authority to exercise negative discretion to lower payouts if additional discretionary goals are adopted and these discretionary goals are not achieved.

For the 2010 AIP, all of the NEOs adopted a discretionary safety goal. Messrs. Koonce, Christian and Stutts adopted discretionary
business unit financial goals and Mr. Stutts also adopted discretionary operating and stewardship goals. These goals are described under

2010 AIP Payouts

. The table below shows the goal weightings applied to these discretionary goals.

* 5% goal weighting is for a safety goal. Mr. Stutts had other non-safety operating and stewardship goals as described below.

The formula for calculating an award is:

The 2010 discretionary business unit financial goals and accomplishment levels for
Mr. Koonce (Dominion Virginia Power), Mr. Christian (Dominion Generation) and Mr. Stutts (DRS) were as follows:

(1)

Services Company officers and employees carry an expense goal rather than
a net income goal.

A discretionary safety goal of minimizing OSHA recordable incident rates to a specified
target number was adopted for all of the NEOs. Each NEO achieved his safety goal. In addition to his safety goal, which was weighted 5%, Mr. Stutts had discretionary operating and stewardship goals in four other categories: compliance (weighted
5%); training (weighted 10%); regulatory (weighted 5%); and efficiency improvements (weighted 5%). Mr. Stutts had a compliance goal to improve cycle time for disposition of compliance incident reports. His training goal was to identify in-house
training opportunities that would benefit employees and the company. His regulatory goal was to meet deadlines for filings in all jurisdictions and maintain the quality of final work. The efficiency goal was to implement a new legal matters
management system and bring to full usage. Mr. Stutts fully achieved all of these operating and stewardship goals.

Long-Term Incentive Program

O

VERVIEW

Dominion’s long-term incentive program focuses on
Dominion’s longer-term strategic goals and retention. Since 2006, 50% of Dominion’s long-term incentives have been full value equity awards in the form of restricted stock with time-based vesting and the other 50% have been
performance-based awards. Dominion believes restricted stock serves as a strong retention tool and also creates a focus on Dominion’s stock price to further align the interests of officers with the interests of Dominion’s shareholders. For
those officers who have made substantial progress toward their share ownership guidelines, 50% of their long-term award is in the form of a cash performance grant. Because officers are expected to retain ownership of shares upon vesting of
restricted stock awards, as explained in

Share Ownership Guidelines,

the long-term cash performance grant balances the program and allows a portion of the long-term incentive award to be accessible to the NEOs during the course of their
employment.

The CGN Committee approves long-term incentive awards in January each year with a grant date established in
early February. This process ensures incentive-based awards are made at the beginning of the performance period and shortly after the public disclosure of Dominion’s earnings for the prior year. Like the AIP target award levels discussed above,
long-term incentive target award levels are established based on a number of factors, including historical practice, individual and company performance, and internal pay equity considerations, and are compared against peer group data to ensure the
appropriate competitiveness of an NEO’s total direct compensation opportunity. However, as discussed above, long-term incentive target award levels are not targeted at a specific percentile or range of the peer group data, nor was market survey
data a factor in setting long-term incentive target award levels for 2010.

Through 2009, the long-term incentive values for
all NEOs, except for Mr. McGettrick, remained at the same target levels as they had been since 2006, which was the first year Dominion granted performance-based awards as part of the long-term incentive compensation program.
Mr. McGettrick’s long-term incentive compensation value has remained at the same target level since 2007. The CGN Committee considered the job performance to date of the NEOs, the increased scope of responsibilities assumed and recent
promotions or job rotations and determined it was appropriate to increase the target levels for the NEOs’ 2010 long-term incentive awards from their 2006 target level, or in the case of Mr. McGettrick, his 2007 target level.

Most officers, including the NEOs, received cash performance grants on February 1, 2010. Officers who had not achieved 50% of their targeted share ownership guideline received stock-based performance
grants. Dividend equivalents are not paid on any performance-based grants. The performance period commenced on January 1, 2010 and will end on December 31, 2011. Mr. Stutts’ payout, if any, under his 2010 performance grant will be
determined after the end of the performance period ending December 31, 2011 and will be pro-rated based on his months of service during such period. The 2010 grants are denominated as a target award, with potential payouts ranging from 0-200% of the
target based on Dominion’s TSR relative to the peer group of companies selected by the CGN Committee and ROIC, weighted equally.

The TSR metric was selected to focus officers on long-term shareholder value when developing and implementing their strategic plans and in turn, reward management based on the achievement of TSR levels as
measured relative to Dominion’s peer companies. The ROIC metric was selected to reward officers for the achievement of expected levels of return on the company’s investments. Dominion believes an ROIC measure encourages management to
choose the right investments, and with those investments, to achieve the highest returns possible through prudent decisions, management and control of costs. The target awards of the 2010 performance grants made to the NEOs are disclosed in the

In February 2011, final payouts were made to officers who received 2009 performance grants, including the NEOs. The 2009 performance
grants were based on three goals: TSR for the two-year period ended December 31, 2010 relative to Dominion’s peer group of companies (weighted 50%); ROIC for the same two-year period (weighted 40%); and BVP as of December 31, 2010
(weighted 10%).

Ÿ

Relative TSR (50% weighting)

. TSR is the difference between the value of a share of common stock at the beginning and end of the two-year
performance period, plus dividends paid as if reinvested in stock. For this metric, Dominion’s TSR is compared to TSR levels at its peer companies for the same two-year period. The peer group for the TSR metric for the 2009 performance grant is
the same group of companies described above in

The Peer Group and Peer Group Comparisons.

The relative TSR targets and corresponding payout scores are as follows:

*

TSR weighting is interpolated between the top and bottom of the percentages within a quartile. A minimum payment of 25% of the TSR percentage will be made if the TSR
performance is at least 10% on a compounded annual basis for the performance period, regardless of relative performance.

Actual relative TSR performance for the 2009-2010 period was in the top quartile.

Ÿ

ROIC (40% weighting).

ROIC reflects the company’s total return divided by average invested capital for the performance period. The ROIC
goal at target is consistent with the strategic plan/annual business plan as approved by the Board. For this purpose, total return is the company’s consolidated operating earnings plus its after-tax interest and related charges, plus preferred
dividends. Dominion designed its 2009 ROIC goals to provide 100% payout if it achieved an average ROIC of 8.86% over the two-year performance period. The ROIC performance targets and corresponding payout scores are as follows:

*

ROIC percentage payout is interpolated between the top and bottom of the percentages for any range.

Actual ROIC performance for the 2009-2010 period was 8.82%.

Ÿ

BVP

(10% weighting)

. BVP measures the company’s value according to its balance sheet (the difference between assets

and liabilities) as opposed to the market value of company stock, subject to certain pre-approved exclusions, whether positive or negative, as set forth in the awards. It measures the use of
funds as well as the efficiency of issuing stock. The CGN Committee applied a 10% weighting to this measure in order to allow a mix of performance measures while maintaining the desired focus on relative TSR and ROIC. BVP was calculated as common
shareholders’ equity divided by the number of outstanding shares as of December 31, 2010. The BVP targets and corresponding payout scores are as follows:

* BVP percentage payout is interpolated between the top and bottom of the percentages for any range.

Actual BVP for the 2009-2010 period was $21.89.

Based on the
achievement of the performance criteria, the CGN Committee approved a 127.6% payout for the 2009 performance grants. The following table summarizes the achievement of the 2009 performance criteria:

In December 2010, the CGN Committee approved a restricted stock grant of 28,000 shares to Mr. Farrell to retain and secure his services for the next five years to provide the leadership stability to
implement Dominion’s strategic plans. The grant supports CEO succession planning and the vesting terms of the grant further align Mr. Farrell’s interests with the interests of shareholders. The restricted shares are subject to a
five-year cliff vesting with all



shares vesting on December 17, 2015 (the Vesting Date). Mr. Farrell will forfeit the restricted stock grant if his employment with Dominion terminates prior to the Vesting Date for any
reason other than a change in control, death or disability. In the event of a change in control, death or disability, the restricted shares are subject to vesting on a pro-rated basis. Dividends will be paid on the restricted shares, but will be
retained and subject to the same vesting terms as the restricted shares.

Employee and Executive Benefits

Benefit plans and limited perquisites composed the fourth element of the compensation program. These benefits serve as a retention tool and reward
long-term employment.

LANS

Dominion sponsors two types of tax-qualified retirement plans for eligible employees, including the NEOs: a defined benefit pension plan (the Pension Plan) and a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan
(the 401(k) Plan). The NEOs, as employees hired before 2008, are eligible for a pension benefit upon attainment of retirement age based on a formula that takes into account final compensation and years of service. They also receive a cash balance
benefit under which the company contributes 2% of each participant’s compensation to a special retirement account, which may be paid in a lump sum or added to the annuity benefit upon retirement. The formula for the Pension Plan is explained in
the narrative following the

Pension Benefits

table. The change in Pension Plan value for 2010 for the NEOs is included in the

Summary Compensation Table

.

Officers whose matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan are limited by the Internal Revenue Code receive a cash payment to make them whole for the company match lost as a result of these limits. These
cash payments are currently taxable. The company matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan and the cash payments of company matching contributions above Internal Revenue Code limits for the NEOs are included in the

All Other Compensation

column of the

Summary Compensation Table

and detailed in the footnote for that column.

Dominion also maintains two
nonqualified retirement plans, the BRP and the ESRP, for the executives. Unlike the Pension Plan and 401(k) Plan, these plans are unfunded, unsecured obligations of Dominion. These plans keep Dominion competitive in attracting and retaining
officers. Due to Internal Revenue Code limits on Pension Plan benefits and because a more substantial portion of total compensation for officers is paid as incentive compensation than for other employees, the Pension Plan and 401(k) Plan alone will
produce a lower percentage of replacement income in retirement for officers than these plans will for other employees. The BRP restores benefits that will not be paid under the Pension Plan due to the Internal Revenue Code limits. The ESRP provides
a benefit that covers a portion (25%) of final base salary and target annual incentive compensation to partially make up for this gap in retirement income. The BRP and ESRP do not include long-term incentive compensation in benefit calculations
and, therefore, a significant portion of the potential compensation for the officers is excluded from calculation in any retirement plan benefit. As consideration for the benefits earned under the BRP and ESRP, all officers agree to comply with
confidentiality and one-year non-competition

requirements set forth in the plan documents following their retirement or other termination of employment. The present value of accumulated benefits under these retirement plans is disclosed in
the

Pension Benefits

table and the terms of the plans are fully explained in the narrative following that table.

In May
2010, the CGN Committee entered into a supplemental retirement agreement with Mr. McGettrick. This agreement restates and clarifies the terms of prior agreements entered into in 2005 and 2007 as well as the surviving provisions of his 1999
employment agreement. Mr. McGettrick will earn a lifetime benefit under the ESRP if he remains employed as an officer of Dominion until November 14, 2012, effectively giving him previously earned age and service credit toward the lifetime ESRP
benefit that was provided to him under the surviving provisions of his 1999 employment agreement and later restated in a February 2007 letter agreement. As consideration for this benefit, Mr. McGettrick has agreed not to compete with the
company for a two-year period following retirement. This agreement ensures that his knowledge and services will not be available to competitors for two years following his retirement date.

ROGRAMS

Officers participate
in all of the benefit programs available to other employees. The core benefit programs generally include medical, dental and vision benefit plans, a health savings account, health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, group-term life
insurance, travel accident coverage, long-term disability coverage and a paid time off program.

Dominion also maintains an
executive life insurance program for officers to replace a former company-wide retiree life insurance program that was discontinued in 2003. The plan is fully insured by individual policies that provide death benefits at a fixed amount depending on
an officer’s salary tier. This life insurance coverage is in addition to the group-term insurance that is provided to all employees. The officer is the owner of the policy and Dominion makes premium payments until the later of 10 years or the
date the officer attains age 64. Officers are taxed on the premiums paid by Dominion. The premiums for these policies are included in the

All Other Compensation

column of the

Summary Compensation Table

.

ERQUISITES

Dominion
provides a limited number of perquisites for officers to enable them to perform their duties and responsibilities as efficiently as possible and to minimize distractions. The CGN Committee annually reviews the perquisites to ensure they are an
effective and efficient use of corporate resources. Dominion believes the benefits it receives from offering these perquisites outweigh the costs of providing them. In addition to incidental perquisites associated with maintaining an office,
Dominion offers the following perquisites to all officers:

Ÿ

An allowance of up to $9,500 a year to be used for health club memberships and wellness programs, comprehensive executive physical exams and financial
and estate planning. Dominion wants officers to be proactive with preventive healthcare and also wants executives to use professional, independent financial and estate planning consultants to ensure proper tax reporting of company-provided
compensation and to help officers optimize their use of Dominion’s retirement and other employee benefit programs.



Ÿ

A vehicle leased by Dominion, up to an established lease-payment limit (if the lease payment exceeds the allowance, the officer pays for the excess
amount on the vehicle). The costs of insurance, fuel and maintenance for company-leased vehicles are paid by Dominion.

Ÿ

In limited circumstances, use of company aircraft for personal travel by executive officers. For security and other reasons, the Board has directed
Mr. Farrell to use the aircraft for all travel, including personal travel, whenever it is feasible to do so. His family and guests may accompany Mr. Farrell on any personal trips. The use of company aircraft for personal travel by other
executive officers is limited and usually related to (i) travel with the CEO or (ii) personal travel to accommodate business demands on an executive’s schedule. With the exception of Mr. Farrell, personal use of aircraft is not
available when there is a company need for the aircraft. Use of company aircraft saves substantial time and allows us to have better access to the executives for business purposes. During 2010, 96% of the use of corporate aircraft was for business
purposes. Other than Mr. Farrell, none of the NEOs or other executive officers used company aircraft for personal travel in 2010.

Other than costs associated with comprehensive executive physical exams (which are exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code), these perquisites are fully taxable to officers. There is no tax
gross-up for imputed income on any perquisites.

GREEMENTS

Dominion has entered into Employment Continuity Agreements with all officers to ensure continuity in the event of a change in control of
Dominion. While Dominion has determined these agreements are consistent with the practices of its peer companies, the most important reason for these agreements is to protect the company in the event of an anticipated or actual change in control of
Dominion. In a time of transition, it is critical to protect shareholder value by retaining and continuing to motivate the company’s core management team. In a change in control situation, workloads typically increase dramatically, outside
competitors are more likely to attempt to recruit top performers away from the company, and officers and other key employees may consider other opportunities when faced with uncertainties at their own company. Therefore, the Employment Continuity
Agreements provide security and protection to officers in such circumstances for the long-term benefit of the company and its shareholders.

In determining the appropriate multiples of compensation and benefits payable upon a change in control, Dominion evaluated peer group and general practices and considered the levels of protection
necessary to retain officers in such situations. The Employment Continuity Agreements are double-trigger agreements that require both a change in control and a qualifying termination of employment to trigger a benefit. The specific terms of the
Employment Continuity Agreements are discussed in

GREEMENTS

Dominion does not have comprehensive employment agreements or severance agreements for its NEOs. Although the CGN Committee believes the compensation and
benefit programs described in this CD&A are appropriate, Dominion, as one of the nation’s largest producers and transporters of energy, is part of a constantly changing and increasingly competitive environment. In recognition of their
valuable knowledge and experience and to secure and retain their services, Dominion has entered into letter agreements with each of the NEOs to provide certain benefit enhancements or other protections, as described in

Share Ownership Guidelines

Dominion requires officers to own and retain significant amounts of Dominion stock during their careers to align their interests with those of Dominion’s shareholders by promoting a long-term focus
through long-term share ownership. The guidelines ensure that management maintains a personal stake in Dominion through significant equity investment in Dominion. Targeted ownership levels are the lesser of the following value or number of shares:

The levels of ownership reflect the increasing level of responsibility for that officer’s position. Shares owned by an officer and his or her immediate family members as well as shares held under
company benefit plans contribute to the ownership targets. Restricted stock, goal-based stock and shares underlying stock options do not contribute to the ownership targets. Dominion prohibits certain types of transactions related to Dominion stock,
including owning derivative securities, hedging transactions, using margin accounts and pledging shares as collateral.

With
limited exceptions, officers are expected to retain ownership of their Dominion stock, including restricted stock and goal-based shares that have vested, as long as they remain employed by the company. Dominion refers to shares held by an officer
that are more than 15% above his or her ownership target as “Qualifying Excess Shares.” Officers may sell up to 50% of their Qualifying Excess Shares at any time, subject to insider trading rules and other policy provisions, and may sell
all Qualifying Excess Shares during the one-year period preceding retirement. Qualifying Excess Shares may also be gifted to a charitable organization or put into a trust outside of the officer’s control for estate planning purposes at any
time.

At least annually, the CGN Committee reviews the share ownership guidelines and monitors compliance by executive
officers, both individually and by the officer group as a whole. The NEOs’ ownership is shown in the

Director and Officer Share Ownership

table; each NEO exceeds his ownership target.



Recovery of Incentive Compensation

Consistent with standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Dominion’s Corporate Governance Guidelines authorize the Board to seek recovery of performance-based compensation paid to
officers who are found to be personally responsible for fraud or intentional misconduct that causes a restatement of financial results filed with the SEC. Beginning in 2009, the CGN Committee approved a broader clawback provision for inclusion in
Dominion’s AIP and long-term incentive performance grant documents. This clawback provision authorizes the CGN Committee, in its discretion and based on facts and circumstances, to recoup AIP and performance grant payouts from any employee
whose fraudulent or intentional misconduct (i) directly causes or partially causes the need for a restatement of a financial statement or (ii) relates to or materially affects Dominion’s operations or the employee’s duties at the
company. Dominion reserves the right to recover a payout by seeking repayment from the employee, by reducing the amount that would otherwise be payable to the employee under another Dominion benefit plan or compensation program to the extent
permitted by applicable law, by withholding future incentive compensation, or any combination of these actions. The clawback provision is in addition to, and not in lieu of, other actions Dominion may take to remedy or discipline misconduct,
including termination of employment or a legal action for breach of fiduciary duty, and any actions imposed by law enforcement agencies.

Tax Deductibility of Compensation

Code Section 162(m) generally disallows a deduction by publicly-held corporations for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the CEO and next three most highly-compensated officers other than
the CFO. If certain requirements are met, performance-based compensation qualifies for an exemption from the Code Section 162(m) deduction limit. Dominion intends to provide competitive executive compensation while maximizing Dominion’s
tax deduction. While the CGN Committee considers Code Section 162(m) tax implications when designing annual and long-term compensation programs and approving payouts under such programs, it reserves the right to approve, and in some cases has
approved, non-deductible compensation when corporate objectives justify the cost of being unable to deduct such compensation. Dominion’s tax department has advised the CGN Committee that the cost of any such lost tax deductions is not material
to the company.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

Dominion measures and recognizes compensation expense in accordance with FASB guidance for share-based payments, which requires that compensation expense relating to share-based payment transactions be
recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The CGN Committee considers the accounting treatment of equity and performance-based compensation when approving awards.

VERVIEW

The Summary Compensation Table provides information in accordance with SEC requirements regarding
compensation earned by the NEOs, as well as amounts accrued or accumulated during years reported with respect to retirement plans and other items. The NEOs include the CEO, the CFO, and the three most highly compensated executive officers of
Virginia Power other than the CEO and CFO.

The amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table and the other tables below
represent the pro-rated compensation amounts attributable to each NEO’s services performed for Virginia Power. The percentage of each NEO’s overall Dominion services performed for Virginia Power during 2010 was as follows:
Mr. Farrell, 28%; Mr. McGettrick, 46%; Mr. Koonce, 85%; Mr. Christian, 53%; and Mr. Stutts, 42%.

The following highlights some of the disclosures contained in this table for the NEOs. Detailed explanations regarding certain types of
compensation paid to an NEO are included in the footnotes to the table.

Salary.

The amounts in
this column are the base salaries earned by the NEOs for the years indicated. For 2010, this amount also includes a 2% merit lump sum payment to all NEOs.

Stock Awards.

The amounts in this column reflect the full grant date fair value of the
stock awards for accounting purposes for the respective year. The amounts shown for 2008 are different from the amounts shown in prior years due to a change in SEC reporting requirements.

Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.

This column includes amounts earned under two performance-based programs: the AIP and cash-based performance grant awards under Dominion’s long-term incentive programs. These performance programs
are based on performance criteria established by the CGN Committee at the beginning of the performance period, with actual performance scored against the pre-set criteria by the CGN Committee at the end of the performance period.

Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings.

This column shows any year-over-year increases in the annual accrual of pension and supplemental retirement benefits for the NEOs. These are accruals for future benefits that may be earned under the
terms of the retirement plans, and do not reflect actual payments made during the year to the NEOs. The amounts disclosed reflect the annual change in the actuarial present value of benefits under defined benefit plans sponsored by the

company, which include Dominion’s tax-qualified Pension Plan and the nonqualified plans described in the narrative following the

Pension Benefits

table. The annual change equals the
difference in the accumulated amount for the current fiscal year and the accumulated amount for the prior fiscal year, generally using the same actuarial assumptions used for Dominion’s audited financial statements for the applicable fiscal
year. For 2009 and 2010, accrued benefit calculations are based on assumptions that the NEOs would retire at the earliest age at which they are projected to become eligible for full, unreduced pension benefits (including the effect of future service
for eligibility purposes), instead of their unreduced retirement age based on current years of service. The application of these assumptions results in a greater increase in the accumulated amount of pension benefits for certain NEOs than would
result without the application of these assumptions. This method of calculation does not increase actual benefits payable at retirement but only how much of that benefit is allocated to the increase during 2009 and 2010, respectively. For Mr.
McGettrick, the accrued benefit calculation for 2010 also reflects the clarification of the commencement date of his lifetime ESRP benefits. Please refer to the footnotes to the

Pension Benefits

table and the narrative following that table
for additional information related to actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension benefits.

All Other Compensation.

The amounts in this column disclose compensation that is not classified as compensation reportable in another column,
including perquisites and benefits with an aggregate value of at least $10,000, the value of company-paid life insurance premiums, company matching contributions to an NEO’s 401(k) Plan account, and company matching contributions paid directly
to the NEO that would be credited to the 401(k) Plan if Internal Revenue Code contribution limits did not apply. For 2010, dividends paid on outstanding restricted stock are not included in All Other Compensation in accordance with SEC rules as the
value of the dividends is factored into the grant date fair value of the restricted stock.

Total.

The number in this column provides a single figure that represents the total compensation either earned by each NEO for the years indicated or
accrued benefits payable in later years and required to be disclosed by SEC rules in this table. It does not reflect actual compensation paid to the NEO during the year, but is the sum of the dollar values of each type of compensation quantified in
the other columns in accordance with SEC rules.

The following table presents information concerning compensation paid or earned by the NEOs for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 as well as the grant date fair value of stock awards
and changes in pension value.

Note: The NEOs included in this table perform services for more than one subsidiary of Dominion. Compensation for the NEOs listed in the table reflects
only the appropriate portion related to their service for Virginia Power in the year presented.

(1)

None of the NEOs received a base salary increase in 2010. All NEOs received a 2% merit lump sum payment on October 25, 2010, as approved by the
CGN Committee on September 24, 2010.

(2)

The amounts in this column reflect the full grant date fair value of stock awards for the respective year grant in accordance with FASB guidance for
share-based payments. Dominion did not grant any stock options in 2010. The amount for Mr. Farrell includes a grant of 28,000 shares of restricted stock for retention purposes. See the Grants of Plan Based Awards table for additional
information regarding the terms of all restricted stock grants made in 2010. See also Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the valuation of stock-based awards and the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End
table for a listing of all outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2010.

(3)

The 2010 amounts in this column include the payout under Dominion’s 2010 AIP and 2009 Performance Grant awards. All of the NEOs received 134%
funding of their 2010 AIP target awards and 100% payout for accomplishment of their goals. The 2010 AIP payouts amounts were as follows: Mr. Farrell: $562,800; Mr. McGettrick: $401,215; Mr. Koonce: $510,397; Mr. Christian:
$334,312; and Mr. Stutts: $193,603. See the CD&A for additional information on the 2010 AIP and the Grants of Plan Based Awards table for the range of each NEO’s potential award under the 2010 AIP. The 2009 Performance Grant award was
issued on February 2, 2009 and the payout amount was determined based on achievement of performance goals for the performance period ended December 31, 2010. Payouts can range from 0% to 200%. The actual payout was 127.6% of the target
amount. The payout amounts were as follows: Mr. Farrell: $1,071,840; Mr. McGettrick: $440,220; Mr. Koonce: $488,070; Mr. Christian: $219,791; and Mr. Stutts: $133,980. The 2009 amounts reflect both the 2009 AIP and the 2008
Performance Grant payouts, and the 2008 amounts reflect both the 2008 AIP and 2007 Performance Grant payouts.

(4)

All amounts in this column are for the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the NEO’s accumulated benefit under the qualified
Pension Plan and nonqualified executive retirement plans. There are no above-market earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation plans. These accruals are not directly in relation to final payout potential, and can vary significantly year over
year based on (i) promotions and corresponding changes in salary; (ii) other one-time adjustments to salary or incentive target for market or other reasons; (iii) actual age versus predicted age at retirement; and (iv) other
relevant factors.



(5)

All Other Compensation amounts for 2010 are as follows:

Note: The NEOs included in this table perform services for more than one subsidiary of Dominion. Compensation for the NEOs listed in the table reflects only the appropriate portion related to their
service for Virginia Power in the year presented.

(a)

Unless noted, the amounts in this column for all NEOs are comprised of the following: personal use of company vehicle and financial planning and health and wellness
allowance. For Mr. Farrell, the amounts in this column also include personal use of the corporate aircraft. The value of Mr. Farrell’s personal use of the aircraft during 2010 was $14,549. For personal flights, all direct operating
costs are included in calculating aggregate incremental cost. Direct operating costs include the following: fuel, airport fees, catering, ground transportation and crew expenses (any food, lodging and other costs). The fixed costs of owning the
aircraft and employing the crew are not taken into consideration, as more than 96% of the use of the corporate aircraft is for business purposes. The CGN Committee has directed Mr. Farrell to use corporate aircraft for all personal travel
whenever it is feasible to do so.

(b)

Employees who contribute to the 401(k) Plan receive a matching contribution of 50 cents for each dollar contributed up to 6% of compensation (subject to IRS limits)
for employees who have less than 20 years of service, and 67 cents for each dollar contributed up to 6% of compensation (subject to IRS limits) for employees who have 20 or more years of service.

(c)

Represents each payment of “lost” 401(k) Plan matching contribution due to IRS limits.

(d)

This amount represents the unused vacation that Mr. Stutts is entitled to due to his retirement on January 1, 2011.

The following table provides information about stock awards and non-equity incentive awards granted to the NEOs
during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Note: The NEOs included in this table perform services for more than one subsidiary of Dominion. Compensation for the NEOs listed in the table reflects
only the appropriate portion related to their service for Virginia Power in the year presented.

(1)

On January 21, 2010, the CGN Committee approved the 2010 long-term
incentive compensation awards for Dominion officers, which consisted of a restricted stock grant and a cash performance grant. The 2010 restricted stock award was granted on February 1, 2010. Under the Dominion 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan,
fair market value is defined as the closing price of Dominion common stock as of the last day on which the stock is traded preceding the date of grant. The grant date fair market value for the February 1, 2010 restricted stock grant was $37.46
per share, which was Dominion’s closing stock price on January 29, 2010. For the award to Mr. Farrell on December 17, 2010, the grant date fair market value was $42.31 per share, which was Dominion’s closing price on
December 16, 2010.

(2)

Amounts represent the range of potential payouts under the 2010 AIP. Actual amounts paid under the 2010 AIP are found in the Non-Equity Incentive
Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. Under Dominion’s AIP, officers are eligible for an annual performance-based award. The



CGN Committee establishes target awards for each NEO based on his salary level and expressed as a percentage of the individual NEO’s base salary. The target award is the amount of cash that
will be paid if the plan is fully funded and payout goals are achieved. For the 2010 AIP, funding was based on the achievement of consolidated operating earnings goals with the maximum funding capped at 200%, as explained under the Annual Incentive
Plan section of the CD&A.

(3)

Amounts represent the range of potential payouts under the 2010 performance grant of the long-term incentive program. Payouts can range from 0% to
200% of the target award. Awards will be paid by March 15, 2012 depending on the achievement of performance goals for the two-year period ending December 31, 2011. The amount earned will depend on the level of achievement of two performance
metrics: TSR—50% and ROIC—50%. TSR measures Dominion’s share performance for the two-year period ended December 31, 2011 relative to the TSR of a group of industry peers selected by the CGN Committee. ROIC goal achievement will
be scored against 2010 and 2011 budget goals. Due to his retirement on January 1, 2011, any payout of Mr. Stutts’ 2010 performance grant will be pro-rated based on his months of service during the performance period.

The performance grant is forfeited in its entirety if an officer voluntarily terminates employment or is terminated with cause before the vesting date. The grants
have pro-rated vesting for retirement, termination without cause, death or disability. In the case of retirement, pro-rated vesting will not occur if the CEO (or, for the CEO, the CGN Committee) determines the officer’s retirement is
detrimental to the company. Payout for an officer who retires or whose employment is terminated without cause is made following the end of the performance period so that the officer is rewarded only to the extent the performance goals are achieved.
In the case of death or disability, payout is made as soon as possible to facilitate the administration of the officer’s estate or financial planning. The payout amount will be the greater of the officer’s target award or an amount based
on the predicted performance used for compensation cost disclosure purposes in Dominion’s financial statements.

In the event of a change in control, the performance grant is vested in its entirety and payout of the performance grant will occur as soon as administratively
feasible following the change in control date at an amount that is the greater of an officer’s target award or an amount based on the predicted performance used for compensation cost disclosure purposes in Dominion’s financial statements.

(4)

The 2010 restricted stock grant of the long-term incentive program fully vests at the end of three years. The restricted stock grant is forfeited in
its entirety if an officer voluntarily terminates employment or is terminated with cause before the vesting date. The restricted stock grant provides for pro-rata vesting if an officer retires, dies, becomes disabled, is terminated without cause, or
if there is a change in control. In the case of retirement, pro-rated vesting will not occur if the CEO (or, for the CEO, the CGN Committee) determines the officer’s retirement is detrimental to Dominion. In the event of a change in control,
pro-rated vesting is provided as of the change in control date, and full vesting if an officer’s employment is terminated, or constructively terminated by the successor entity following the change in control date but before the scheduled
vesting date. Dividends on the restricted shares are paid during the restricted period at the same rate declared by Dominion for all shareholders. Due to his retirement on January 1, 2011, Mr. Stutts became vested in a pro-rata portion of 1,455
shares of his 2010 restricted stock grant in accordance with the terms of the award agreement.

(5)

On December 16, 2010, the CGN Committee awarded Mr. Farrell 28,000 shares of restricted stock for strategic and retention purposes. The
grant date was December 17, 2010 and the shares will fully vest on December 17, 2015, provided Mr. Farrell remains employed until that date. Mr. Farrell will forfeit the restricted stock grant if his employment with Dominion
terminates prior to the vesting date for any reason other than a change in control, death or disability. In the event of a change in control, death or disability, the restricted shares are subject to vesting on a pro-rated basis. Dividends on
the restricted shares are paid during the restricted period at the same rate declared by Dominion for all shareholders. Dividends on these shares will be reinvested and the resulting shares will also maintain a restricted status throughout the term
of the grant.

below and under Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control and Additional Post-Employment Benefits for NEOs for information about the requirements for receiving extra years of credited service and the amount credited, if any, for each
NEO.

(2)

The amounts in this column are based on actuarial assumptions that all of the NEOs would retire at the earliest age they become eligible for
unreduced benefits, which is (i) age 60 for Messrs. Farrell, Koonce, and Christian, (ii) age 55 for Mr. McGettrick (when he would be treated as age 60 based on his five additional years of credited age) and (iii) age 66 for Mr. Stutts
(his current age). In addition, for purposes of calculating the BRP benefits for Messrs. Farrell, McGettrick and Stutts, the amounts reflect additional credited years of service granted to them pursuant to their agreements with the company (see
Additional Post-Employment Benefits for NEOs below). If the amounts in this column did not include the additional years of credited service, the present value of the Benefit Restoration Plan benefit would be $983,742 lower for Mr. Farrell,
$1,229,856 lower for Mr. McGettrick, and $365,298 lower for Mr. Stutts. DPP and ESRP benefits amounts are not augmented by the additional service credit assumptions.

Mr. Stutts retired on January 1, 2011. He will begin receiving his DPP, BRP and ESRP benefits in 2011.



Dominion Pension Plan

The Dominion Pension Plan is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. All of the NEOs participate in the Pension Plan. The Pension Plan provides unreduced retirement benefits at termination of
employment at or after age 65 or, with three years of service, at age 60. A participant who has attained age 55 with three years of service may elect early retirement benefits at a reduced amount. If a participant retires between ages 55 and 60, the
benefit is reduced 0.25% per month for each month after age 58 and before age 60, and reduced 0.50% per month for each month between ages 55 and 58. All of the NEOs have more than three years of service.

The Pension Plan basic benefit is calculated using a formula based on (1) age at retirement; (2) final average earnings;
(3) estimated Social Security benefits; and (4) credited service. Final average earnings are the average of the participant’s 60 highest consecutive months of base pay during the last 120 months worked. Final average earnings do not
include compensation payable under the AIP, the value of equity awards, gains from the exercise of stock options, long-term cash incentive awards, perquisites or any other form of compensation other than base pay.

Credited service is measured in months, up to a maximum of 30 years of credited service. The estimated Social Security benefit taken into
account is the assumed Social Security benefit payable starting at age 65 or actual retirement date, if later, assuming that the participant has no further employment after leaving Dominion. These factors are then applied in a formula.

The formula has different percentages for credited service through December 31, 2000 and on and after January 1, 2001. The
benefit is the sum of the amounts from the following two formulas.

Credited Service is limited to a total of 30 years for all parts of the formula and Credited Service after 2000 is limited to 30 years
minus Credited Service before 2001.

Benefit payment options are (1) a single life annuity or (2) a choice of a 50%,
75% or 100% joint and survivor annuity. A Social Security leveling option is available with any of the benefit forms. The normal form of benefit is a single life annuity for unmarried participants and a 50% joint and survivor annuity for
married participants. All of the payment options are actuarially equivalent in value to the single life annuity. The Social Security leveling option pays a larger benefit equal to the estimated Social Security benefit until the participant is age 62
and then reduced payments after age 62.

The DPP also includes a special retirement account, which is in addition to the
pension benefit. The special retirement account is credited with 2% of base pay each month as well as interest

based on the 30-year Treasury bond rate set annually (4.19% in 2010). The special retirement account can be paid in a lump sum or paid in the form of an annuity benefit.

A participant becomes vested in his or her benefit after completing three years of service. A vested participant who terminates employment
before age 55 can start receiving benefit payments calculated using terminated vested reduction factors at any time after attaining age 55. If payments begin before age 65, then the following reduction factors for the portion of the benefits earned
after 2000 apply: age 64 – 9%; age 63 – 16%; age 62 – 23%; age 61 – 30%; age 60 – 35%; age 59 – 40%; age 58 – 44%; age 57 – 48%; age 56 – 52%; and age 55 – 55%.

The Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of compensation that may be included in determining pension benefits under qualified pension
plans. For 2010, the compensation limit was $245,000. The Internal Revenue Code also limits the total annual benefit that may be provided to a participant under a qualified defined benefit plan. For 2010, this limitation was the lesser of
(i) $195,000 or (ii) the average of the participant’s compensation during the three consecutive years in which the participant had the highest aggregate compensation.

Dominion Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan

The BRP is a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan
designed to make up for benefit reductions under the DPP due to the limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.

A Dominion
employee is eligible to participate in the BRP if (1) he or she is a member of management or a highly compensated employee, (2) his or her DPP benefit is or has been limited by the Internal Revenue Code compensation or benefit limits, and
(3) he or she has been designated as a participant by the CGN Committee. A participant remains a participant until he or she ceases to be eligible for any reason other than retirement or until his or her status as a participant is revoked by
the CGN Committee.

Upon retirement, a participant’s BRP benefit is calculated using the same formula used to determine
the participant’s default annuity form of benefit under the DPP (single life annuity for unmarried participants and 50% joint and survivor annuity for married participants), and then subtracting the benefit the participant is entitled to
receive under the DPP. To accommodate the enactment of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, the portion of a participant’s BRP benefit that had accrued as of December 31, 2004 is frozen, but the calculation of the overall restoration
benefit is not changed.

The restoration benefit is generally paid in the form of a single lump sum cash payment. However, a
participant may elect to receive a single life or 50% or 100% joint and survivor annuity for the portion of his or her benefit that accrued prior to 2005. The lump sum calculation includes an amount approximately equivalent to the amount of taxes
the participant will owe on the lump sum payment so that the participant will have sufficient funds, on an after-tax basis, to purchase an annuity contract.

A participant who terminates employment before he or she is eligible for benefits under the DPP generally is not entitled to a restoration benefit. Messrs. Farrell and McGettrick have been granted age and
service credits for purposes of calculating their DPP and BRP benefits. Mr. Farrell, having attained age 55, has earned benefits based on 25 years of service; if he remains



employed until age 60, benefits will be calculated based on 30 years of service. Mr. McGettrick, having attained age 50, has earned benefits calculated based on five additional years of age
and service. Mr. Stutts, having attained age 65, has earned benefits based on 20 years of service. For each of these NEOs, the additional years of service count for determining both the amount of benefits and the eligibility to receive them.
For additional information regarding service credits, see

Additional Post-Employment Benefits for NEOs

under

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

.

If a vested participant dies when he or she is retirement eligible (on or after age 55), the participant’s beneficiary will receive
the restoration benefit in a single lump sum payment. If a participant dies while employed but before he or she has attained age 55 and the participant is married at the time of death, the participant’s spouse will receive a restoration benefit
calculated in the same way as the 50% Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity payable under the Pension Plan and paid in a lump sum payment.

Dominion Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan

The ESRP is a nonqualified defined benefit plan that provides for an annual retirement benefit equal to 25% of a participant’s final cash
compensation (base salary plus target annual incentive award) payable for a period of 10 years or, for certain participants designated by the CGN Committee, for the participant’s lifetime. To accommodate the enactment of Internal Revenue Code
Section 409A, the portion of a participant’s ESRP benefit that had accrued as of December 31, 2004 is frozen, but the calculation of the overall benefit is not changed.

A Dominion employee is eligible to participate in the ESRP if (1) he or she is a member of management or a highly-compensated
employee, and (2) he or she has been designated as a participant by the CGN Committee. A participant remains a participant until he or she ceases to be eligible for any reason other than retirement or until his or her status as a participant is
revoked by the CGN Committee.

A participant is entitled to the full ESRP benefit if he or she separates from service with
Dominion after reaching age 55 and achieving 60 months of service. An officer who becomes a participant on or after December 1, 2006, must have reached age 55 and completed 60 months of service as an officer in order to be entitled to a full ESRP
benefit. A participant who separates from service with Dominion with at least 60 months of service but who has not yet reached age 55 is entitled to a reduced, pro-rated retirement benefit. A participant who separates from service with Dominion with
fewer than 60 months of service is generally not entitled to an ESRP benefit unless the participant separated from service on account of disability or death.

The ESRP benefit is generally paid in the form of a single lump sum cash payment. However, a participant may elect to receive the portion of his or her benefit that had accrued as of December 31,
2004 in monthly installments. The lump sum calculation includes an amount approximately equivalent to the amount of taxes the participant will owe on the lump sum payment so that the participant will have sufficient funds, on an after-tax basis, to
purchase a 10-year or lifetime annuity contract.

All of the NEOs except Mr. Koonce are currently entitled to a full ESRP
retirement benefit. If Mr. Koonce terminates employment before he attains age 55, he will receive a pro-rated ESRP

benefit. Based on determinations made by the CGN Committee, Messrs. Farrell and Koonce will receive an ESRP benefit calculated as a lifetime benefit, and Mr. McGettrick will receive
ESRP benefits calculated as a lifetime benefit provided he remains employed with Dominion until attainment of age 55. Mr. Christian will receive ESRP benefits calculated as a lifetime benefit provided he remains employed with Dominion until
attainment of age 60.

Actuarial Assumptions Used to Calculate Pension Benefits

Actuarial assumptions used to calculate DPP benefits are prescribed by the terms of the DPP based on Internal Revenue Code and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requirements. The present value of the
accumulated benefit is calculated using actuarial and other factors as determined by the plan actuaries and approved by Dominion. Actuarial assumptions used for the December 31, 2010 benefit calculations shown in the

Pension Benefits

table use a discount rate of 5.90% to determine the present value of the future benefit obligations for the DPP, BRP and ESRP and a lump sum interest rate of 5.15% to estimate the lump sum values of BRP and ESRP benefits. Each NEO is assumed to
retire at the earliest age at which he is projected to become eligible for full, unreduced pension benefits. Beginning with the 2009 calculations, for purposes of estimating future eligibility for unreduced DPP and ESRP benefits, the effect of
future service is considered. Each NEO is assumed to commence DPP payments at the same age as BRP payments. The longevity assumption used to determine the present value of benefits is the same assumption used for financial reporting of the DPP
liabilities, with no assumed mortality before retirement age. Assumed mortality after retirement is based on tables from the Society of Actuaries’ RP-2000 study, projected from 2000 to 2010 with 50% of the Scale AA factors, and further adjusted
for Dominion experience by using an age set-forward factor. For BRP and ESRP benefits, other actuarial assumptions include an assumed tax rate of 40%.

The discount rate for calculating lump sum BRP and ESRP payments at the time an officer terminates employment is selected by Dominion’s Administrative Benefits Committee and adjusted periodically.
For 2010, a 5.28% discount rate was used to determine the lump sum payout amounts. For 2010 and later years, the discount rate for each year will be based on a rolling average of the blended rate published by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
in October of the previous five years.

No preferential earnings are paid and therefore no earnings from these plans are included in the Summary Compensation Table.



At this time, Dominion does not offer any nonqualified elective deferred compensation plans
to its officers or other employees. The

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

table reflects, in aggregate, the plan balances for two former plans offered to officers and other highly compensated employees: Dominion Resources, Inc.
Executives’ Deferred Compensation Plan (Frozen Deferred Compensation Plan) and Dominion Resources, Inc. Security Option Plan (Frozen DSOP), which were frozen as of December 31, 2004. Although the Frozen DSOP was an option plan rather than
a deferred compensation plan, Dominion is including information regarding the plan and any balances in this table to make full disclosure about possible future payments to officers under Dominion’s employee benefit plans.

The Frozen Deferred Compensation Plan includes amounts previously deferred from one of the following categories of compensation:
(i) salary; (ii) bonus; (iii) vesting restricted stock, and (iv) gains from stock option exercises. The plan also provided for company contributions of lost company 401(k) Plan match contributions and transfers from several CNG
deferred compensation plans. The Frozen Deferred Compensation Plan offers 28 investment funds for the plan balances, including a Dominion Stock Fund. Participants may change investment elections on any business day. Any vested restricted stock and
gains from stock option exercises that were deferred were automatically allocated to the Dominion Stock Fund and this allocation cannot be changed. Earnings are calculated based on the performance of the underlying investment fund.

The NEOs invested in the following funds with rates of returns for 2010 as follows: Vanguard 500 Index Fund, 14.9%; Dominion Resources
Stock Fund, 14.47%; and Dominion Fixed Income Fund, 4.19%. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has the same rate of return as the corresponding publicly available mutual fund.

The Dominion Fixed Income Fund is an investment option that provides a fixed rate of return each year based on a formula that is tied to the adjusted federal long-term rate published by the IRS in
November prior to the beginning of the year. Dominion’s Asset Management Committee determines the rate based on its estimate of the rate of return on Dominion assets in the trust for the Frozen Deferred Compensation Plan.

The default Benefit Commencement Date is February 28 after the year in which the participant retires, but the participant may select
a different Benefit Commencement Date in accordance with the plan. Participants may change their Benefit Commencement Date election; however, a new election must be made at least six months before an existing Benefit Commencement Date. Withdrawals
less than six months prior to an existing Benefit Commencement Date are subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Account balances must be fully paid out no later than the February 28 that is 10 calendar years after a participant retires or
becomes disabled. If a participant retires from Dominion, he or she may continue to defer an account balance provided that the total balance is distributed by this deadline. In the event of termination of employment for reasons other than death,
disability or retirement before an elected Benefit Commencement Date, benefit payments will be distributed in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable. Hardship distributions, prior to an elected Benefit Commencement Date, are available
under certain limited circumstances.

Participants may elect to have their benefit paid in a lump sum payment or equal annual
installments over a period of whole years from one to 10 years. Participants have the ability to change their distribution schedule for benefits under the plan by giving six months notice to the plan administrator. Once a participant begins
receiving annual installment payments, the participant can make a one-time election to either (1) receive the remaining account balance in the form of a lump sum distribution or (2) change the remaining installment payment period. Any
election must be approved by the company before it is effective. All distributions are made in cash with the exception of the Deferred Restricted Stock Account and the Deferred Stock Option Account, which are distributed in the form of Dominion
common stock.

The Frozen DSOP enabled employees to defer all or a portion of their salary and bonus and receive options on
various mutual funds. Participants also received lost company matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan in the form of options under this plan. DSOP options can be exercised at any time before their expiration date. On exercise, the participant
receives the excess of the value, if any, of the underlying mutual funds over the strike price. The participant can currently choose among options on 27 mutual funds, and there is not a Dominion stock alternative or a fixed income fund. Participants
may change options among the mutual funds on any business day. Benefits grow/decline based on the total return of the mutual funds selected. Any options that expire do not have any value. Options expire under the following terms:

Ÿ

Options expire on the last day of the 120th month after retirement or disability;

Ÿ

Options expire on the last day of the 24th month after the participant’s death (while employed);

Ÿ

Options expire on the last day of the 12th month after the participant’s severance;

Ÿ

Options expire on the 90th day after termination with cause; and

Ÿ

Options expire on the last day of the 120th month after severance following a change in control.

Under certain circumstances, Dominion provides benefits to eligible employees upon termination of
employment, including a termination of employment involving a change in control of the



company, that are in addition to termination benefits for other employees in the same situation.

Change in Control

As discussed in the

Employee
and Executive Benefits

section of the CD&A, Dominion has entered into an Employment Continuity Agreement with each of its officers, including the NEOs. Each agreement has a three-year term and is automatically extended annually for an
additional year, unless cancelled by Dominion.

The Employment Continuity Agreements require two triggers for the payment of
most benefits:

Ÿ

There must be a change in control; and

Ÿ

The executive must either be terminated without cause, or terminate his or her employment with the surviving company after a “constructive
termination.” Constructive termination means the executive’s salary, incentive compensation or job responsibility is reduced after a change in control or the executive’s work location is relocated more than 50 miles without his or her
consent.

For purposes of the Employment Continuity Agreements, a change in control will occur if
(i) any person or group becomes a beneficial owner of 20% or more of the combined voting power of Dominion voting stock or (ii) as a direct or indirect result of, or in connection with, a cash tender or exchange offer, merger or other
business combination, sale of assets, or contested election, the directors constituting the Dominion Board before any such transaction cease to represent a majority of Dominion’s or its successor’s Board within two years after the last of
such transactions.

If an executive’s employment following a change in control is terminated without cause or due to a
constructive termination, the executive will become entitled to the following termination benefits:

Ÿ

Lump sum severance payment equal to three times base salary plus AIP award (determined as the greater of (i) the target annual award for the
current year or (ii) the highest actual AIP payout for any one of the three years preceding the year in which the change in control occurs).

Ÿ

Full vesting of benefits under ESRP and BRP with five years of additional credited age and five years of additional credited service from the change in
control date.

Ÿ

Group-term life insurance. If the officer elects to convert group-term insurance to an individual policy, the company pays the premiums for 12 months.

Ÿ

Executive life insurance. Premium payments will continue to be paid by Dominion until the earlier of: (1) the fifth anniversary of the termination
date, or (2) the later of the 10th anniversary of the policy or the date the officer attains age 64.

Ÿ

Retiree medical coverage will be determined under the relevant plan with additional age and service credited as provided under an officer’s letter
agreement (if any) and including five additional years credited to age and five additional years credited to service.

Ÿ

Outplacement services for one year (up to $25,000).

Ÿ

If any payments are classified as “excess parachute payments” for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 280G and the

executive incurs the excise tax, Dominion will pay the executive an amount equal to the 280G excise tax plus a gross-up multiple.

The terms of awards made under the LTIP, rather than the terms of Employment Continuity Agreements, will determine the vesting of each
award in the event of a change in control. These provisions are described in the

Long-Term Incentive Program

section of the CD&A.

Additional Post-Employment Benefits for NEOs

Under
the terms of letter agreements with the NEOs, the following benefits are available in addition to the benefits described above. These benefits are quantified in the table below to the extent they would be payable if the triggering event set forth in
the table occurred on December 31, 2010.

Mr. Farrell.

Mr. Farrell has earned a lifetime benefit under the ESRP. For purposes of calculating his benefits under the DPP and BRP, Mr. Farrell has earned 25 years of credited service as he has met the
requirement of remaining employed until he attained age 55. He will be credited with 30 years of service if he remains employed until he attains age 60. Mr. Farrell will become entitled to a payment of one times salary upon his retirement as
consideration for his agreement not to compete with Dominion for a two-year period following retirement. This agreement ensures that his knowledge and services will not be available to competitors for two years following his retirement date.

Mr. McGettrick.

Mr. McGettrick will earn a lifetime benefit under the ESRP if he remains employed until he attains age 55. He has earned five years of additional age and service credit for purposes of computing his
retirement benefits and eligibility for benefits under the ESRP, long-term incentive grants, and retiree medical and life insurance plans as he has met the requirement of remaining employed until he attained age 50. If Mr. McGettrick terminates
employment before he attains age 55, he will be deemed to have retired for purposes of determining his vesting credit under the terms of his restricted stock and performance grant awards.

Mr. Koonce.

Mr. Koonce earned a lifetime benefit under the ESRP in early 2010 upon his attainment of age 50. If Mr. Koonce leaves Dominion before age 55, he will be entitled to a pro-rated ESRP benefit.

Mr. Christian.

Mr. Christian will earn a lifetime benefit under the ESRP if he remains employed with Dominion until he attains age 60. As consideration for this benefit, Mr. Christian has agreed not to compete with Dominion for a two-year period
following retirement. This agreement ensures that his knowledge and services will not be available to competitors for two years following his retirement date.

Mr. Stutts.

Mr. Stutts joined Dominion mid-career in 1997. At the time of his
employment, Dominion agreed to credit him with 20 years of service (eight additional years) if he remained employed until he attained age 65 for purposes of computing his retirement benefits under the Pension Plan and BRP; he has attained age 65.
Mr. Stutts retired effective January 1, 2011.



The table below provides the incremental payments that would be earned by each NEO if his employment had been terminated, or
constructively terminated, as of December 31, 2010. These benefits are in addition to retirement benefits that would be payable on any termination of employment. Please refer to the

Pension Benefits

table for information related to the
present value of accumulated retirement benefits payable to the NEOs.

Incremental Payments Upon Termination and Change in Control

Note: The NEOs included in this table perform services for more than one subsidiary of Dominion. Compensation for the NEOs listed in the table reflects
only the appropriate portion related to their service for Virginia Power for the year presented.

(1)

Grants made in 2008, 2009 and 2010 under the LTIP vest pro-rata upon termination without cause, death or disability. These grants vest pro-rata upon retirement
provided the CEO of Dominion (or in the case of the CEO, the CGN Committee) determines the NEO’s retirement is not detrimental to the company; amounts shown assume this determination was made. The amounts shown in the restricted stock column
are based on the closing stock price of $42.72 on December 31, 2010.

(2)

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 28, 2003, Mr. Farrell will be entitled to a special payment of one times salary in exchange for a two-year
non-compete agreement. Mr. Farrell would not be entitled to this non-compete payment in the event of his death.

(3)

Amounts in this column represent the value of the incremental benefit the NEOs would receive for executive life insurance and retiree medical coverage.
Mr. McGettrick is eligible for retiree medical and executive life insurance upon any termination due to his letter agreement. Messrs. Farrell, Christian and Stutts are entitled to executive life insurance coverage and retiree medical benefit
upon any termination since they are retirement eligible and have completed 10 years of service. Mr. Koonce is eligible for retiree medical and executive life insurance upon a change in control. Retiree health benefits have been quantified using
assumptions used for financial accounting purposes.

(4)

For the NEOs who are eligible for retirement, this table assumes they would retire in connection with any termination event. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated May
2010, Mr. McGettrick would be considered as retired under any termination event.

(5)

The amounts indicated upon a change in control are the incremental amounts attributable to five years of additional age and service credited pursuant to the
Employment Continuity Agreements that each NEO would receive over the amounts payable upon a retirement (Messrs. Farrell, McGettrick, Christian and Stutts) or a voluntary termination or termination without cause (Mr. Koonce).

Related
Party Transactions

Virginia Power’s Board has adopted the Related Party Guidelines also approved by Dominion’s Board of
Directors. These
guide-

lines were adopted for the purpose of identifying potential conflicts of interest arising out of financial transactions, arrangements and relations between Virginia Power and any related persons.
Under the guidelines, a related person is a director, executive officer, director nominee, a beneficial owner of more than 5% of Dominion’s common stock, or any immediate family member of one of the foregoing persons. A related party
transaction is any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in excess of $120,000 in which Virginia Power
(and/or any of its consolidated subsidiaries) is a party and in which the related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

In determining whether a direct or indirect interest is material, the significance of the information to investors in light of all circumstances is considered. The importance of the interest to the person
having the interest, the relationship of the parties to the transaction with each other and the amount involved are also among the factors considered in determining the significance of the information to the investors.

Dominion’s CGN Committee has reviewed certain categories of transactions and determined that transactions between Dominion and a
related person that fall within such categories will not result in the related person receiving a direct or indirect material interest. Under the guidelines, such transactions are not deemed related party transactions and therefore not subject to
review by the CGN Committee. The categories of excluded transactions include, among other items, compensation and expense reimbursement paid to directors and executive officers in the ordinary course of performing their duties; transactions with
other companies where the related party’s only relationship is as an employee, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of that company’s gross revenues; and charitable contributions which are less
than the greater of $1 million or 2% of the charity’s annual receipts. The full text of the guidelines can be found on Dominion’s website at www.dom.com/investors/corporate-governance/pdf/related_party_guidelines.pdf.

Virginia Power collects information about potential related party transactions in its annual questionnaires completed by directors and
executive officers. The General Counsel and the Chief Legal Officer review the potential related party transactions and assess whether any of the identified transactions constitute a related party transaction. Any identified related party
transactions are then reported to Dominion’s CGN Committee. Dominion’s CGN Committee reviews and considers relevant facts and circumstances and determines whether to ratify or approve the related party transactions identified.
Dominion’s CGN Committee may only approve or ratify related party transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of Dominion and its shareholders and are in compliance with Virginia Power’s Code of Ethics.

Since January 1, 2010 there have been no related party transactions involving Virginia Power that were required either to
be approved under Virginia Power’s policies or reported under the SEC related party transactions rules.



Director Independence

Under NYSE listing standards, Messrs. Farrell, McGettrick and Rogers are not independent as they are executive officers of Virginia Power or of its parent company, Dominion. All of Virginia Power’s
outstanding common stock is owned by Dominion and therefore, Virginia Power is a “controlled” company under the rules of the NYSE. Because Virginia Power meets the definition of a “controlled company” and has only debt securities
and preferred stock listed on the NYSE, it is exempt under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange Rules from the provisions relating to board committees and the requirement to have a majority of its board be independent.

consist of assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review
of Virginia Power’s consolidated financial statements or internal control over financial reporting. This category may include fees related to the performance of audits and attest services not required by statute or regulations, due diligence
related to mergers, acquisitions, and investments, and accounting consultations about the application of GAAP to proposed transactions.

Virginia Power’s board has adopted Dominion’s Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy for its independent auditor’s services and fees and has delegated the execution of this policy to
Dominion’s audit committee (DRI Audit Committee). In accordance with this delegation, each year the DRI Audit Committee pre-approves a schedule that details the services to be provided for the following year and an estimated charge for such
services. At its December 2010 meeting, the DRI Audit Committee approved Virginia Power’s schedule of services and fees for 2011. In accordance with the pre-approval policy, any changes to the pre-approved schedule may be pre-approved by the
DRI Audit Committee or a member of this committee.
