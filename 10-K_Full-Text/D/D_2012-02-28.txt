Part I

Item 1. Business

G

ENERAL

Dominion

, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and
incorporated in Virginia in 1983, is one of the nation’s largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominion’s strategy is to be a leading provider of electricity, natural gas and related services to customers primarily in the eastern
region of the U.S. Dominion’s portfolio of assets includes approximately 28,142 MW of generating capacity, 6,300 miles of electric transmission lines, 56,800 miles of electric distribution lines, 11,000 miles of natural gas transmission,
gathering and storage pipeline and 21,800 miles of gas distribution pipeline, exclusive of service lines of two inches in diameter or less. Dominion also operates the nation’s largest underground natural gas storage system, with approximately
947 bcf of storage capacity, and serves nearly 6 million utility and retail energy customers in 15 states.

Dominion is focused
on expanding its investment in regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution and regulated natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure within and around its existing footprint. As a result, regulated capital projects will
continue to receive priority treatment in its spending plans. Dominion expects this will increase its earnings contribution from regulated operations, while reducing the sensitivity of its earnings to commodity prices.

Dominion continues to expand and improve its regulated electric and natural gas businesses, in accordance with its five-year investment
program. A major impetus for this program is to meet the anticipated increase in electricity demand in its electric utility service territory as forecasted by PJM. Other drivers for the capital investment program include the need to construct
infrastructure to handle the increase in natural gas production from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations; and to upgrade its gas distribution and electric transmission and distribution network. Dominion has announced that it may make further
substantial investments in other gas projects over the next five years.

Dominion’s nonregulated operations include
merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities and retail energy marketing operations. Dominion’s operations are conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power.

Virginia Power

, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1909 as a Virginia public service corporation,
is a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and North Carolina. In Virginia, Virginia Power conducts business under the name “Dominion Virginia Power.” In North Carolina, it
conducts business under the name “Dominion North Carolina Power” and serves retail customers located in the northeastern region of the state, excluding certain municipalities. In addition, Virginia Power sells electricity at wholesale
prices to rural electric cooperatives, municipalities and into wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Power’s common stock is owned by Dominion.

Amounts disclosed for Dominion are inclusive of Virginia Power, where applicable.

E

MPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2011, Dominion had approximately
15,800 full-time employees, of which approximately 5,900 employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2011, Virginia Power had approximately 6,800 full-time employees, of which approximately 3,100 employees
are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

EGMENTS

Dominion manages its daily operations through three primary operating segments: DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy. Dominion
also reports a Corporate and Other segment, which includes its corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt) and the net impact of the operations and sale of Peoples, which is discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominion’s operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’ performance
or allocating resources among the segments.

Virginia Power manages its daily operations through two primary operating
segments: DVP and Dominion Generation. It also reports a Corporate and Other segment that primarily includes specific items attributable to its operating segments that

are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’ performance or allocating resources among the segments.

While daily operations are managed through the operating segments previously discussed, assets remain wholly-owned by Dominion and
Virginia Power and their respective legal subsidiaries.

A description of the operations included in the Companies’
primary operating segments is as follows:

For additional financial information on operating segments, including revenues from external customers,
see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on operating revenue related to Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s principal products and services, see Notes 2 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
which information is incorporated herein by reference.

DVP

The DVP Operating Segment of Virginia Power

includes Virginia Power’s regulated electric transmission and distribution (including customer service) operations, which serve approximately 2.4
million residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in Virginia and North Carolina.

Virginia Power has
announced its five-year investment plan, which includes spending approximately $4 billion from 2012 through 2016 to upgrade or add new transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand
within its service territory and maintain reliability. The proposed electric delivery infrastructure projects are intended to address both continued population growth and increases in electricity consumption by the typical consumer. In addition,
data centers continue to contribute to anticipated demand growth, with an expected load of approximately 715 MW by the end of 2013.

Revenue provided by electric distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Variability in earnings is driven primarily by changes in rates,
weather, customer growth and other factors impacting consumption such as the economy and energy conservation, in addition to operating and maintenance expenditures. Operationally, electric distribution continues to focus on improving service levels
while striving to reduce costs and link investments to operational results. As a result, electric service reliability and customer service have improved. The three-year average SAIDI has improved from 127 minutes at the end of 2006 to 111 minutes at
the end of 2011. Likewise, ASA has also shown significant improvement. The three-year average ASA has improved from 60



seconds at the end of 2006 to 40 seconds at the end of 2011. Customer service options continue to be enhanced and expanded through the use of technology. Customers now have the ability to use the
Internet for routine billing and payment transactions, connecting and disconnecting service, reporting outages and obtaining outage updates. Additionally, customers can follow progress to restore electric service following major outages by accessing
Facebook or Twitter. As electric distribution moves forward, safety, electric service reliability and customer service will remain key focal areas.

Revenue provided by Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by FERC. The profitability of this business is dependent on its ability, through the rates
it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings primarily results from changes in rates and the timing of property additions, retirements and depreciation.

Virginia Power is a member of PJM, an RTO, and its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM wholesale electricity markets.
Consistent with the increased authority given to NERC by EPACT, Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations are committed to meeting NERC standards, modernizing its infrastructure and maintaining superior system reliability. Virginia
Power’s electric transmission operations will continue to focus on safety, operational performance, NERC compliance and execution of PJM’s RTEP.

The DVP Operating Segment of Dominion

includes all of Virginia Power’s regulated electric transmission and distribution operations as discussed above, as well as Dominion’s nonregulated
retail energy marketing operations.

Dominion’s retail energy marketing operations compete in nonregulated energy markets.
The retail business requires limited capital investment and currently employs approximately 190 people. The retail customer base includes 2.2 million customers and is diversified across three product lines-natural gas, electricity and home warranty
services. Dominion has a heavy concentration of natural gas customers in markets where utilities have a long-standing commitment to customer choice. Dominion pursues customers in electricity markets where utilities have divested of generation assets
and where customers are permitted and have opted to purchase from the market. Major growth drivers are net customer additions, new market penetration, product development and expanded sales channels and supply optimization.

C

OMPETITION

DVP
Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

Within Virginia Power’s service territory in Virginia and North Carolina, there is
no competition for electric distribution service. Additionally, since its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM, electric transmission services are administered by PJM and are not subject to competition in relation to transmission
service provided to customers within the PJM region. Virginia Power is seeing continued growth in new customers in its transmission and distribution operations.

DVP Operating Segment—Dominion

Dominion’s retail energy marketing operations
compete against incumbent utilities and other energy marketers in nonregulated

energy markets for natural gas and electricity. Customers in these markets have the right to select a retail marketer and typically do so based upon price savings or price stability; however,
incumbent utilities have the advantage of long-standing relationships with their customers and greater name recognition in their markets.

R

EGULATION

Virginia
Power’s electric retail service, including the rates it may charge to jurisdictional customers, is subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission. Virginia Power’s electric transmission rates, tariffs
and terms of service are subject to regulation by FERC. Electric transmission siting authority remains the jurisdiction of the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. However, EPACT provides FERC with certain backstop authority for transmission
siting. See

State Regulations and Federal Regulations

in

Regulation

and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a discussion of the 2011 Biennial Review Order.

P

ROPERTIES

Virginia Power
has approximately 6,300 miles of electric transmission lines of 69 kV or more located in the states of North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Portions of Virginia Power’s electric transmission lines cross national parks and forests under
permits entitling the federal government to use, at specified charges, any surplus capacity that may exist in these lines. While Virginia Power owns and maintains its electric transmission facilities, they are a part of PJM, which coordinates the
planning, operation, emergency assistance and exchange of capacity and energy for such facilities.

Each year, as part of
PJM’s RTEP process, reliability projects are authorized. In 2011, Virginia Power completed construction of two of the major construction projects authorized in 2006, Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun and Carson-to-Suffolk, which are each designed to
improve the reliability of service to customers and the region.

As part of subsequent annual PJM RTEP processes, PJM
authorized additional electric transmission upgrade projects including Hayes-to-Yorktown in December 2008 and Mt. Storm-to-Doubs and Dooms-to-Bremo in December 2010. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on these and other electric transmission projects.

In addition, Virginia Power’s electric distribution
network includes approximately 56,800 miles of distribution lines, exclusive of service level lines, in Virginia and North Carolina. The grants for most of its electric lines contain rights-of-way that have been obtained from the apparent owner of
real estate, but underlying titles have not been examined. Where rights-of-way have not been obtained, they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation, if necessary. Many electric lines are on publicly-owned property, where permission to
operate can be revoked.

S

EASONALITY

DVP
Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

DVP’s earnings vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature
and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. An increase in heating
degree-days for DVP’s electric utility related operations does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree-days, due to seasonal pricing differentials and because alternative heating sources are more readily
available.

DVP Operating Segment—Dominion

The earnings of Dominion’s retail energy marketing operations also vary seasonally. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs,
while the demand for gas peaks during the winter months to meet heating needs.

Dominion Generation

The Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power

includes the generation operations of the Virginia Power regulated electric utility and
its related energy supply operations. Virginia Power’s utility generation operations primarily serve the supply requirements for the DVP segment’s utility customers.

Earnings for the Generation operating segment of Virginia Power primarily result from the sale of electricity generated by its utility fleet. Revenue is based primarily on rates established by state
regulatory authorities and state law. Approximately 80% of revenue comes from serving Virginia jurisdictional customers. Rates for the Virginia jurisdiction are set using a modified cost-of-service rate model. The cost of fuel and purchased power is
generally collected through fuel cost-recovery mechanisms established by regulators and does not materially impact net income. Variability in earnings for Virginia Power’s generation operations results from changes in rates, the demand for
services, which is primarily weather dependent, and labor and benefit costs, as well as the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. See

Electric Regulation in Virginia

under

Regulation

and Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a discussion of the 2011 Biennial Review Order.

The
Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Dominion

includes Virginia Power’s generation facilities and its related energy supply operations described above as well as the generation operations of Dominion’s merchant fleet and energy
marketing and price risk management activities for these assets. The Generation operating segment of Dominion derives its earnings primarily from the sale of electricity generated by Virginia Power’s utility and Dominion’s merchant
generation assets, as well as

associated capacity and ancillary services from Dominion’s merchant generation assets.

Variability in earnings provided by Dominion’s merchant fleet relates to changes in market-based prices received for electricity and capacity. Market-based prices for electricity are largely
dependent on commodity prices, primarily natural gas, and the demand for electricity, which is primarily dependent upon weather. Capacity prices are dependent upon resource requirements in relation to the supply available (both existing and new) in
the forward capacity auctions, which are held approximately three years in advance of the associated delivery year. Dominion manages electric and capacity price volatility of its merchant fleet by hedging a substantial portion of its expected
near-term sales with derivative instruments and also entering into long-term power sales agreements. However, earnings have been adversely impacted due to a sustained decline in commodity prices. Variability also results from changes in the cost of
fuel consumed, labor and benefits and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages.

C

OMPETITION

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

Virginia Power’s generation operations are not subject to significant competition as only a limited number of its Virginia jurisdictional electric utility customers have retail choice. See

Regulation-State Regulations-Electric

for more information. Currently, North Carolina does not offer retail choice to electric customers.

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion

Unlike Dominion Generation’s regulated generation fleet, its merchant generation fleet is dependent on its ability to operate in a competitive environment and does not have a predetermined rate
structure that allows for a rate of return on its capital investments. Competition for the merchant fleet is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity,
technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. These competitive factors may negatively impact the merchant fleet’s ability to profit from the sale of
electricity and related products and services.

Dominion Generation’s merchant generation fleet owns and operates several
facilities in the Midwest that operate within functioning RTOs. A significant portion of the output from these facilities is sold under long-term contracts, with expiration dates ranging from December 31, 2012 to August 31, 2017, and is
therefore largely unaffected by price competition during the term of these contracts. Following expiration of these contracts, earnings could be adversely impacted if prevailing prices for energy, capacity and ancillary services are lower than the
levels currently received under these contracts.

Dominion Generation’s other merchant assets also operate within
functioning RTOs and primarily compete on the basis of price. Competitors include other generating assets bidding to operate within the RTOs. These RTOs have clearly identified market rules that ensure the competitive wholesale market is



functioning properly. Dominion Generation’s merchant units have a variety of short- and medium-term contracts, and also compete in the spot market with other generators to sell a variety of
products including energy, capacity and ancillary services. It is difficult to compare various types of generation given the wide range of fuels, fuel procurement strategies, efficiencies and operating characteristics of the fleet within any given
RTO. However, Dominion applies its expertise in operations, dispatch and risk management to maximize the degree to which its merchant fleet is competitive compared to similar assets within the region.

R

EGULATION

Virginia
Power’s utility generation fleet and Dominion’s merchant generation fleet are subject to regulation by FERC, the NRC, the EPA, the DOE, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal, state and local authorities. Virginia Power’s
utility generation fleet is also subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission. See

ROPERTIES

For a listing
of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s existing generation facilities, see Item 2. Properties.

Dominion Generation Operating
Segment—Dominion and Virginia Power

The generation capacity of Virginia Power’s electric utility fleet totals 18,985 MW. The
generation mix is diversified and includes coal, nuclear, gas, oil, hydro and renewables. Virginia Power’s generation facilities are located in Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina and serve load in Virginia and northeastern North
Carolina.

Based on available generation capacity and current estimates of growth in customer demand in its utility service
area, Virginia Power will need additional generation capacity over the next decade. Virginia Power has announced a comprehensive generation growth program, referred to as

Powering Virginia

, which involves the development, financing,
construction and operation of new multi-fuel, multi-technology generation capacity to meet the anticipated growing demand in its core market in Virginia. Significant projects under construction or development include:

Ÿ

The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center located in Wise County, Virginia, is expected to generate about 585 MW when completed. The baseload facility is
estimated to cost $1.8 billion, excluding financing costs. Construction was approximately 95% complete at the end of 2011, and commercial operations are expected to commence in the summer of 2012.

Ÿ

Warren County is expected to generate more than 1,300 MW of electricity when operational. In February 2012, the Virginia Commission authorized the
construction of this power station, which is estimated to cost approximately $1.1 billion, excluding financing costs. Commercial operations are scheduled to commence by late 2014. In connection with the air permit process for Warren County,
Virginia Power reached an agreement to permanently retire North Branch, a 74 MW coal-fired plant located in West Virginia, once Warren County begins commercial operations.

Ÿ

Virginia Power plans to convert three coal-fired Virginia generating stations to biomass, a renewable energy source. The conversions of the power
stations in Altavista, Hopewell and Southampton County would increase Dominion’s renewable generation by more than 150 MW and are expected to cost approximately $165 million, excluding financing costs. After approvals by the Virginia Department
of Environmental Quality and the Virginia Commission, construction will begin; these conversions are expected to be complete by the end of 2013.

Ÿ

Subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, Virginia Power plans to construct a combined-cycle natural gas-fired power station in Brunswick
County, Virginia, that is expected to generate more than 1,300 MW. If the project is approved, commercial operations are expected to commence in 2016. Brunswick County has approved a conditional use permit to allow for construction of the
plant. This facility would more than offset the expected reduction in capacity caused by the anticipated retirement of coal-fired units at Chesapeake and Yorktown during 2015 and 2016 primarily due to the cost of compliance with MATS. The
facility would be similar to the power station being built in Warren County, Virginia, which is estimated to cost approximately $1.1 billion, excluding financing costs.

In May 2011, Virginia Power completed construction of Bear Garden, at a total cost of approximately $620 million, excluding financing
costs, and the 590 MW combined-cycle, natural gas-fired power station commenced commercial operations.

In addition to the
projects above, Virginia Power is considering the construction of a third nuclear unit at a site located at North Anna. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this project.

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion

The generation capacity of Dominion’s merchant fleet totals 9,157 MW. The generation mix is diversified and includes nuclear, coal, gas, oil and renewables. Merchant generation facilities are located
in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Wisconsin with a majority of that capacity concentrated in New England. Dominion is the largest generator in ISO-NE and, mirroring the region’s load
demand, has principally baseload units with the remainder split between intermediate and peaking.

In the first quarter of
2011, Dominion decided to pursue the sale of Kewaunee. Any sale of Kewaunee would be subject to the approval of Dominion’s Board of Directors, as well as applicable state and federal approvals.

During the second quarter of 2011, Dominion announced its intention to retire State Line by mid-2014 and to retire two of the four units
at Salem Harbor by the end of 2011 and the remaining two Salem Harbor units on June 1, 2014. These decisions were prompted by the economic outlook for both facilities, in combination with the expectation that State Line would be impacted by
potential environmental regulations that would likely require significant capital expenditures. During the third quarter of 2011, Dominion announced an accelerated schedule for State Line, with the facility to be retired in the first quarter of
2012, given a continued decline in power prices and the expected cost to comply with environmental regulations.



Salem Harbor units 1 and 2 were retired as planned on December 31, 2011.

—Dominion Generation purchases electricity from the PJM spot market and through power purchase agreements with other suppliers to provide for utility system load requirements.

Dominion Generation also occasionally purchases electricity from the PJM, ISO-NE and MISO spot markets to satisfy physical
forward sale requirements as part of its merchant generation operations.

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Virginia Power

Presented below is a summary of Virginia Power’s actual system output by energy source:

(1)

Excludes ODEC’s 11.6% ownership interest in North Anna.

(2)

Excludes ODEC’s 50.0% ownership interest in the Clover power station. The average cost of coal for 2011 Virginia in-system generation was $33.55 per MWh.

(3)

Includes oil, hydro and biomass.

S

EASONALITY

Sales of electricity for Dominion Generation typically vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential
and commercial customers. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. An increase in heating degree-days does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling
degree-days, due to seasonal pricing differentials and because alternative heating sources are more readily available.

ECOMMISSIONING

In June 2011, the NRC amended its regulations to improve decommissioning planning. As applied to the operators of nuclear power plants, these amendments require licensees to conduct operations in a
manner minimizing introduction of residual radioactivity into the site, perform additional surveys, and maintain records of their results. In addition, the amendments make minor changes to financial assurance methods and require additional
information on decommissioning and spent fuel management costs after a plant permanently ceases operations. The revised regulations will become effective in December 2012 and are not expected to significantly affect the decommissioning cost
estimates or funding for Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s units.

Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion and Virginia
Power

Virginia Power has a total of four licensed, operating nuclear reactors at its Surry and North Anna power stations in Virginia.

Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once
operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. Amounts collected from ratepayers and placed into trusts have been invested to fund the expected future costs of decommissioning the Surry and North Anna units.

Virginia Power believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient
to cover expected decommissioning costs, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects the long-term
investment horizon, since the units will not be decommissioned for decades, and a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns. Virginia Power will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial
assurance requirement, which may include the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial guarantees recognized by the NRC.

The total estimated cost to decommission Virginia Power’s four nuclear units is $2.2 billion in 2011 dollars and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed in 2009. The current cost
estimates assume decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations, which will occur when the operating licenses expire. Virginia Power expects to decommission the Surry and North Anna units during the period 2032 to 2067.



Dominion Generation Operating Segment—Dominion

In addition to the four nuclear units discussed above, Dominion has three licensed, operating nuclear reactors, two at Millstone in Connecticut and one at
Kewaunee in Wisconsin. A third Millstone unit ceased operations before Dominion acquired the power station. As part of Dominion’s acquisition of both Millstone and Kewaunee, it acquired decommissioning funds for the related units. Any funds
remaining in Kewaunee’s trust after decommissioning is completed are required to be refunded to Wisconsin ratepayers. Dominion believes that the amounts currently available in the decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be
sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone and Kewaunee units. Dominion will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance requirement, which may include the use of parent company
guarantees, surety bonding or other financial guarantees recognized by the NRC. The total estimated cost to decommission Dominion’s eight units is $4.7 billion in 2011 dollars and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed in 2009.
For the Millstone and Kewaunee operating units, the current cost estimate assumes decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations, which will occur when the operating licenses expire. Millstone Unit 1 is not in service
and selected minor decommissioning activities are being performed. This unit will continue to be monitored until full decommissioning activities begin for the remaining Millstone operating units. Dominion expects to start minor decommissioning
activities at Millstone Unit 2 in 2035, with full decommissioning of Millstone Units 1, 2 and 3 at the permanent cessation of operations of Millstone Unit 3 during the period 2045 to 2069. In February 2011, the NRC approved the renewal of the
Kewaunee operating license. The renewal permits Kewaunee to operate through December 21, 2033 with full decommissioning of Kewaunee during the period 2033 to 2065.

The estimated decommissioning costs and license expiration dates for the nuclear units owned by Dominion and Virginia Power are shown in the following table.

(1)

The cost estimates shown above are total decommissioning cost estimates and differ from the cost estimates used to calculate Dominion’s and Virginia
Power’s nuclear decommissioning AROs. Among other items, the cost estimates above do not reflect any reduction for the expected future

recovery from the DOE of certain spent fuel costs based on the Companies’ contracts with the DOE for disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

(2)

North Anna is jointly owned by Virginia Power (88.4%) and ODEC (11.6%). However, Virginia Power is responsible for 89.26% of the decommissioning obligation. Amounts
reflect 89.26% of the decommissioning cost for both of North Anna’s units.

(3)

Unit 1 ceased operations in 1998, before Dominion’s acquisition of Millstone.

(4)

Millstone Unit 3 is jointly owned by Dominion Nuclear Connecticut, with a 6.53% undivided interest in Unit 3 owned by Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric
Company and Central Vermont Public Service Corporation. Decommissioning cost is shown at 100% and the trust funds are shown at Dominion’s ownership percentage. At December 31, 2011, the minority owners held approximately $27 million
of trust funds related to Millstone Unit 3 that are not reflected in the table above.

Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about AROs and nuclear decommissioning, respectively.

Dominion Energy

Dominion Energy includes Dominion’s regulated natural gas distribution companies, regulated gas transmission pipeline and storage
operations, natural gas gathering and by-products extraction activities and regulated LNG operations. Dominion Energy also includes producer services, which aggregates natural gas supply, engages in natural gas trading and marketing activities and
natural gas supply management and provides price risk management services to Dominion affiliates.

The gas transmission
pipeline and storage business serves gas distribution businesses and other customers in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Included in Dominion’s gas transmission pipeline and storage business is its gas gathering and extraction activity,
which sells extracted products at market rates. Dominion’s LNG operations involve the import and storage of LNG at Cove Point and the transportation of regasified LNG to the interstate pipeline grid and mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets. In
connection with the recent increase in Eastern U.S. natural gas production, including from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, Dominion has requested regulatory authority to operate Cove Point as a bi-directional facility, able to import LNG,
and vaporize it as natural gas, and liquefy natural gas and export it as LNG. See

Future Issues and Other Matters

in MD&A for more information.

Revenue provided by Dominion’s regulated gas transmission and storage and LNG operations is based primarily on rates established by FERC. Additionally, Dominion receives revenue from firm fee-based
contractual arrangements, including negotiated rates, for certain gas transportation, gas storage, LNG storage and regasification services. Dominion’s gas distribution operations serve residential, commercial and industrial gas sales and
transportation customers. Revenue provided by its gas distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by the Ohio and West Virginia Commissions. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on Dominion’s ability, through
the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings results from operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services,
which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy.

In October 2008, East Ohio implemented a rate
case settlement which provided for a straight-fixed-variable rate design.



Under this rate design, East Ohio recovers a larger portion of its fixed operating costs through a flat monthly charge accompanied by a reduced volumetric base delivery rate. Accordingly, East
Ohio’s revenue is less impacted by weather-related fluctuations in natural gas consumption than under the traditional rate design.

Earnings from Dominion Energy’s producer services business are unregulated, and are subject to variability associated with changes in commodity prices. Producer services uses physical and financial
arrangements to hedge this price risk.

C

OMPETITION

Dominion Energy’s gas transmission operations compete with domestic and Canadian pipeline companies. Dominion also competes with gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage
and other services. Alternative energy sources, such as oil or coal, provide another level of competition. Although competition is based primarily on price, the array of services that can be provided to customers is also an important factor. The
combination of capacity rights held on certain long-line pipelines, a large storage capability and the availability of numerous receipt and delivery points along its own pipeline system enable Dominion to tailor its services to meet the needs of
individual customers.

Retail competition for gas supply exists to varying degrees in the two states in which Dominion’s
gas distribution subsidiaries operate. In Ohio, there has been no legislation enacted to require supplier choice for residential and commercial natural gas consumers. However, Dominion offers an Energy Choice program to customers, in cooperation
with the Ohio Commission. At December 31, 2011, approximately 1 million of Dominion’s 1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in this Energy Choice Program. West Virginia does not require customers to choose their provider in its
retail natural gas markets at this time. However, the West Virginia Commission has issued regulations to govern pooling services, one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customers a choice in the future and has
issued rules requiring competitive gas service providers to be licensed in West Virginia. See

Regulation-State Regulations-Gas

for additional information.

ROPERTIES

Dominion Energy’s gas distribution network is located in the states of Ohio and West Virginia. This network involves approximately 21,800 miles of
pipe, exclusive of service lines of two inches in diameter or less. The rights-of-way grants for many natural gas pipelines have been obtained from the actual owner of real estate, as underlying titles have been examined. Where rights-of-way have
not been obtained, they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation, if necessary. Many natural gas pipelines are on publicly-owned property, where company rights and actions are determined on a case-by-case basis, with results that range
from reimbursed relocation to revocation of permission to operate.

Dominion Energy has approximately 11,000 miles of gas transmission, gathering and storage
pipelines located in the states of Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Dominion Energy operates gas processing and fractionation facilities in West Virginia with a total processing capacity of 267,000 mcf per day
and fractionation capacity of 582,000 gallons per day. Dominion Energy also operates 20 underground gas storage fields located in New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, with almost 2,000 storage wells and approximately 349,000 acres of
operated leaseholds.

The total designed capacity of the underground storage fields operated by Dominion Energy is
approximately 947 bcf. Certain storage fields are jointly-owned and operated by Dominion Energy. The capacity of those fields owned by Dominion’s partners totals about 242 bcf. Dominion Energy also has about 15 bcf of above-ground storage
capacity at Cove Point. Dominion Energy has about 128 compressor stations with more than 777,000 installed compressor horsepower.

In August 2009, Dominion announced the proposed development of the Keystone Connector Project, a joint venture with The Williams Companies that would transport new natural gas supplies from the
Appalachian Basin to Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation’s Station 195, providing access to markets throughout the eastern U.S. The joint venture was terminated in June 2011. DTI is currently independently marketing its Keystone
Connector Project. Project timing is subject to producer drilling plans in the Appalachian Basin, as well as customer demand throughout the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.

In January 2011, Dominion completed the $50 million Cove Point Pier Reinforcement Project to upgrade, expand and modify the existing pier at the Cove Point terminal to accommodate the next generation of
LNG vessels (up to 267,000 cubic meters) that are much larger than those that could previously be accommodated (no larger than 148,000 cubic meters).

DTI has announced the Gathering Enhancement Project, a $253 million expansion of its natural gas gathering, processing and liquids facilities in West Virginia. The project is designed to increase the
efficiency and reduce high pressures in its gathering system, thus increasing the amount of natural gas local producers can move through DTI’s West Virginia system. Construction started in 2009 and is expected to be completed by the fourth
quarter of 2012. The cost of the project will be paid for by rates charged to producers.

In June 2011, FERC approved
DTI’s $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project. The project is expected to provide approximately 484,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation services for new Appalachian gas supplies in West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania to an
interconnection with Texas Eastern Transmission, LP at Oakford, Pennsylvania. Construction has commenced and transportation services are scheduled to begin by September 2012.

In August 2011, DTI received FERC authorization for the Northeast Expansion Project. The project is expected to provide approximately 200,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation services for
CONSOL’s Marcellus Shale natural gas production from various receipt points in central and southwestern Pennsylvania to a nexus of market pipelines and storage facilities in Leidy, Pennsylvania. The project is expected to cost approximately
$100 million. Construction of new compression facilities



at three existing compressor stations in central Pennsylvania is expected to begin in March 2012, with a projected in-service date of November 2012.

In September 2011, FERC approved DTI’s proposed Ellisburg-to-Craigs project. The project is expected to have capacity of
approximately 150,000 dekatherms per day, which will be leased by TGP to move Marcellus shale natural gas supplies from TGP’s 300 Line pipeline system in northern Pennsylvania to its 200 Line pipeline system in upstate New York. The project is
expected to cost approximately $46 million. Construction of additional compression facilities and a new measurement and regulating station is expected to begin in March 2012, with a projected in-service date of November 2012.

In November 2011, DTI filed a FERC application for approval to construct the $17 million Sabinsville to Morrisville project, a pipeline to
move additional Marcellus supplies from a TGP pipeline in northeast Pennsylvania to its line in upstate New York. DTI executed a binding precedent agreement with TGP in October 2010 to provide this firm transportation service up to 92,000 dekatherms
per day for a 14-year term. Construction is expected to commence April 2013 with an expected in service date of November 2013.

DTI is developing the Allegheny Storage Project, which is expected to provide approximately 7.5 bcf of incremental storage service and
125,000 dekatherms per day of associated year-round firm transportation service to three local distribution companies under 15-year contracts. Storage capacity for the project will be provided from storage pool enhancements at DTI and capacity
leased from East Ohio. DTI intends to construct additional compression facilities and upgrade measurement and regulation in order to provide 115,000 dekatherms per day of transportation service. The remaining 10,000 dekatherms per day of
transportation service will not require construction of additional facilities. The $112 million project is expected to be in service in 2014, subject to FERC approval, which DTI requested in February 2012.

In February 2011, DTI concluded a binding open season for its $67 million Tioga Area Expansion Project, which is designed to provide
approximately 270,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation service from supply interconnects in Tioga and Potter Counties in Pennsylvania to DTI’s Crayne interconnect with Texas Eastern Transmission, LP in Greene County, Pennsylvania and
the Leidy interconnect with Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company in Clinton County, Pennsylvania. Two customers have contracted for the service under 15-year terms. DTI filed a certificate application with FERC in November 2011. Subject to the
receipt of regulatory approvals, the project is anticipated to be in service in November 2013.

In January 2011, Dominion
announced the development of a natural gas processing and fractionation facility in Natrium, West Virginia, and in July 2011 it executed a contract for the construction of the first phase of the facility. This phase of the project is fully
contracted and is expected to be in service by December 2012. The Phase 1 costs for processing, fractionation, plant inlet and outlet natural gas transportation, gathering, and various modes of NGL transportation is approximately $500 million.
Dominion is also in negotiations for the possible construction of Phase 2 at Natrium, which could be in service by the fourth
quar-

ter of 2013. The complete project is designed to process up to 400,000 mcf of natural gas per day and fractionate up to 59,000 barrels of NGLs per day.

In March 2011, East Ohio filed a request with the Ohio Commission to accelerate the PIR program by nearly doubling its PIR spending to
more than $200 million annually. East Ohio identified 1,450 miles of pipeline that need to be replaced, in addition to the pipeline originally identified in the PIR project scope. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

S

UPPLY

Dominion Energy’s natural gas supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the Mid-Continent
and Gulf Coast regions, local producers in the Appalachian area and gas marketers. Dominion’s large underground natural gas storage network and the location of its pipeline system are a significant link between the country’s major
interstate gas pipelines, including the Rockies Express East pipeline, and large markets in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. Dominion’s pipelines are part of an interconnected gas transmission system, which provides access to supplies
nationwide for local distribution companies, marketers, power generators and industrial and commercial customers.

Dominion’s underground storage facilities play an important part in balancing gas supply with consumer demand and are essential to
serving the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. In addition, storage capacity is an important element in the effective management of both gas supply and pipeline transmission capacity.

S

EASONALITY

Dominion
Energy’s natural gas distribution business earnings vary seasonally, as a result of the impact of changes in temperature on demand by residential and commercial customers for gas to meet heating needs. Historically, the majority of these
earnings have been generated during the heating season, which is generally from November to March, however implementation of the straight-fixed-variable rate design at East Ohio has reduced the earnings impact of weather-related fluctuations. Demand
for services at Dominion’s pipeline and storage business can also be weather sensitive. Commodity prices can be impacted by seasonal weather changes, the effects of unusual weather events on operations and the economy. Dominion’s producer
services business is affected by seasonal changes in the prices of commodities that it transports, stores and actively markets and trades.

TRATEGY

Dominion and Virginia Power are committed to being good environmental stewards. Their ongoing objective is to
provide reliable, affordable energy for their customers while being environmentally responsible. The integrated strategy to meet this objective consists of five major elements:

Ÿ

Compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules;

Ÿ

Conservation and load management;

Ÿ

Renewable generation development;

Ÿ

Other generation development to maintain fuel diversity, including clean coal, advanced nuclear energy, and natural gas; and

Ÿ

Improvements in other energy infrastructure.

This strategy incorporates Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s efforts to voluntarily reduce GHG emissions, which are described below. See

Dominion Generation—Properties

for more
information on certain of the projects described below, as well as other projects under current development.

Environmental Compliance

Dominion and Virginia Power remain committed to compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules related to their operations.
Additional information related to Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s environmental compliance matters can be found in

Future Issues and Other Matters

in MD&A and in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Conservation and Load Management

Conservation
plays a significant role in meeting the growing demand for electricity. The Regulation Act provides incentives for energy conservation and sets a voluntary goal to reduce electricity consumption by retail customers in 2022 by ten percent of the
amount consumed in 2006 through the implementation of conservation programs. Legislation in 2009 added definitions of peak-shaving and energy efficiency programs and allowed for a margin on operating expenses and revenue reductions related to energy
efficiency programs.

Virginia Power’s DSM programs provide important incremental steps toward achieving the voluntary ten
percent energy conservation goal. The conservation and load management plan includes the following DSM programs, which were approved by the Virginia Commission in March 2010 and were rolled out in May 2010:

Ÿ

Residential Lighting Program—an instant, in-store discount on the purchase of qualifying compact fluorescent lights;

Ÿ

Home Energy Improvement—energy audits and improvements for homes of low-income customers;

Ÿ

Smart Cooling Rewards—incentives for residential customers who voluntarily enroll to allow Virginia Power to cycle their air conditioners and heat
pumps during periods of peak demand;

Ÿ

Commercial Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Upgrade Program—incentives for commercial customers to improve the energy efficiency of their
heating and/or cooling units; and

Ÿ

Commercial Lighting Program—incentives for commercial customers to install energy-efficient lighting.

In September 2011, Virginia Power filed an application for approval of six additional DSM programs and to expand the approved Commercial
Lighting and Commercial Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Upgrade programs, in addition to requesting annual recovery of DSM program costs. The proposed DSM programs include:

Ÿ

Commercial Energy Audit Program—an on-site energy audit providing commercial customers with information to evaluate potential energy cost savings
options;

Ÿ

Commercial Duct Testing & Sealing—an incentive for commercial customers to seal duct and air distribution systems to improve system
efficiency;

Ÿ

Commercial Refrigeration Program—an incentive for commercial customers to install more efficient refrigeration technologies;

Ÿ

Commercial Distributed Generation—a redesigned distributed generation program allowing customers to commit their on-site back-up generators to
Virginia Power during periods of peak demand;

Ÿ

Residential Lighting Phase II—an extension of the initial in-store discount on the purchase of qualifying compact fluorescent lighting as well as
light-emitting diode bulbs to phase out and replace conventional incandescent bulbs; and

Ÿ

Residential Bundle Program—a bundle of four residential programs to be available to residential customers, including a Residential Home Energy
Check-up Program, Residential Duct Testing & Sealing Program, Residential Heat Pump Tune-Up Program and Residential Heat Pump Upgrade Program.

In September 2010, Virginia Power filed with the North Carolina Commission an application for approval and its initial request for cost recovery of the five DSM programs initially approved in Virginia, as
well as the distributed generation program. In February 2011, the North Carolina Commission approved the five DSM programs approved in Virginia, and Virginia Power subsequently launched the residential lighting program in May 2011 and the remainder
of the approved programs in June 2011. In a separate order issued in September of 2011, the North Carolina Commission denied approval of Virginia Power’s proposed distributed generation program.

Virginia Power continues to assess smart grid technologies through a demonstration designed to indicate how these technologies may enhance
Virginia Power’s electric distribution system by allowing energy to be delivered more efficiently. The demonstration involves a limited deployment, within Virginia Power’s Virginia service territory, of smart meters that use digital
technology to enable two-way communication between the meter and Virginia Power’s electric distribution system. Dependent upon the outcome of the demonstration and certain regulatory proceedings, Virginia Power may make a significant investment
in replacing existing meters with Advanced Metering Infrastructure. The technology is intended to help customers monitor and control their



energy use. It is also expected to lead to more efficient use of the power grid, which is expected to result in energy savings and lower environmental emissions. Moreover, deployment of smart
grid technology is expected to provide more accurate outage information, fewer service calls, and faster service restoration.

Renewable Generation

Renewable energy is also an important component of a diverse and reliable energy mix. Both Virginia and North Carolina have passed
legislation setting targets for renewable power. Virginia Power is committed to meeting Virginia’s goals of 12% renewable power by 2022 and 15% by 2025, and North Carolina’s RPS of 12.5% by 2021. In May 2010, the Virginia Commission
approved Virginia Power’s participation in the state’s RPS program. As a participant, Virginia Power is permitted to seek recovery, through rate adjustment clauses, of the costs of programs designed to meet RPS goals. Virginia Power plans
to meet the respective RPS targets in Virginia and North Carolina by utilizing existing renewable facilities, as well as through additional renewable generation where it makes sense for customers. In addition, Virginia Power intends to purchase
renewable energy certificates, as permitted by each RPS program, to meet any remaining annual requirement needs. Virginia Power continues to explore opportunities to develop new renewable facilities within its service territory, the energy
attributes of which would qualify for inclusion in the RPS programs.

Dominion has invested in wind energy through two joint
ventures. Dominion is a 50% owner of NedPower. Dominion’s share of this project produces 132 MW of renewable energy. Dominion is also a 50% owner with BP of the first phase of Fowler Ridge, which has a generating capacity of 300 MW. Dominion
has a long-term agreement with Fowler Ridge to purchase 200 MW of energy, capacity and environmental attributes from this first phase. In the first quarter of 2011, Dominion completed the sale of its remaining share of the development assets of the
second phase of Fowler Ridge to BP.

In October 2011, Virginia Power filed with the Virginia Commission an application to
conduct a solar distributed generation demonstration program, consisting of up to a combined 30 MW of company-owned solar distributed generation facilities to be located at selected commercial, industrial and community locations throughout its
Virginia service territory, as well as up to a combined 3 MW of customer-owned solar distributed generation facilities that will be subject to a tariff filed with the Virginia Commission in 2012. If approved, this program is expected to generate
enough electricity to power about 6,000 homes during peak daylight hours.

Other Generation Development

Virginia Power has announced a comprehensive generation growth program, referred to as

Powering Virginia

, which involves the
development, financing, construction and operation of new multi-fuel, multi-technology generation capacity to meet the anticipated growth in demand in its core market of Virginia. Virginia Power expects that these investments collectively will
provide the following benefits: expanded electricity production capability, increased technological and fuel diversity and a reduction in the CO


emission intensity of its generation fleet.

Improvements in Other Energy Infrastructure

Virginia Power’s five-year investment plan includes significant capital expenditures to upgrade or add new transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing
electricity demand within its service territory and maintain reliability. These enhancements are primarily aimed at meeting Virginia Power’s continued goal of providing reliable service, and are intended to address both continued population
growth and increases in electricity consumption by the typical consumer. An additional benefit will be added capacity to efficiently deliver electricity from the renewable projects now being developed or to be developed in the future.

Virginia Power is taking measures to ensure that its electrical infrastructure can support the expected demand from electric vehicles,
which have significantly lower carbon intensity than conventional vehicles. Virginia Power has partnered with Ford Motor Company to help prepare Virginia for the operation of electric vehicles, in a collaboration that involves consumer outreach,
educational programs and the exchange of information on vehicle charging requirements.

Dominion, in connection with its
five-year growth plan, is also pursuing the construction or upgrade of regulated infrastructure in its natural gas business.

Dominion and Virginia
Power’s Strategy for Voluntarily Reducing GHG Emissions

While Dominion and Virginia Power have not established a standalone GHG
emissions reduction target or timetable, they are actively engaged in voluntary reduction efforts, as well as working toward achieving required RPS standards established by existing state regulations, as set forth above. The Companies have an
integrated voluntary strategy for reducing overall GHG emission intensity that is based on maintaining a diverse fuel mix, including nuclear, coal, gas, oil, hydro and renewable energy, investing in renewable energy projects and promoting energy
conservation and efficiency efforts. Below are some of the Companies’ efforts that have or are expected to reduce the Companies’ overall carbon emissions or intensity:

Ÿ

In 2003, Virginia Power retired two oil-fired units at its Possum Point power station, replacing them with a new 559 MW combined-cycle natural gas
unit. Virginia Power also converted two coal-fired units at Possum Point to cleaner burning natural gas.

Ÿ

Since 2000, Dominion has added over 2,600 MW of non-emitting nuclear generation and over 3,500 MW of new lower-emitting natural gas-fired
generation including nearly 1,600 MW at Virginia Power (excluding Possum Point), to its generation mix.

Ÿ

Virginia Power added 83 MW of renewable biomass and has plans to convert three coal-fired power stations to biomass, which is anticipated to be
considered carbon neutral by regulatory agencies.

Ÿ

Dominion has over 800 MW of wind energy in operation or development.

Ÿ

Virginia Power completed construction of the natural gas-fired Bear Garden generating facility in May 2011.

Ÿ

Virginia Power is constructing the natural gas-fired Warren County power station. In connection with the air permit process for Warren County, Virginia
Power reached an



agreement with the National Park Service to permanently retire the North Branch power station, a 74 MW coal fired plant located in West Virginia, once Warren County begins commercial operations.

Ÿ

Virginia Power plans to construct an additional combined-cycle natural gas-fired power station similar in size to Warren County to replace coal-fired
units at Chesapeake and Yorktown that are anticipated to be retired in 2015 and 2016.

Ÿ

Virginia Power has received an Early Site Permit from the NRC for the possible addition of approximately 1,500 MW of nuclear generation in Virginia.
Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit.

Ÿ

Virginia Power has developed the DSM programs described above.

Ÿ

Virginia Power has initiated a demonstration of smart grid technologies as described above.

Ÿ

In October 2011, Virginia Power announced plans to develop the community solar power program described above.

Ÿ

Dominion retired two coal-fired units at Salem Harbor in 2011 and announced that the remaining units at Salem Harbor will be retired during the second
quarter of 2014.

Ÿ

Dominion has announced its plans to retire State Line during the first quarter of 2012.

While Virginia Power’s new Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, which is currently under construction in southwest
Virginia, will be a new source of GHG emissions upon entering service, Virginia Power has taken steps to minimize the impact on the environment. The new plant is expected to use at least 10% biomass for fuel and is designed to be carbon-capture
compatible, meaning that technology to capture CO


can be
added to the station if or when it becomes commercially available. Also, Virginia Power has announced plans to convert its coal units at Bremo to natural gas, contingent upon the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center entering service and receipt of
necessary approvals. It is currently estimated that the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center will have the potential to emit about 4.8 million metric tonnes of direct CO


emissions in a year assuming a 100% capacity factor and 100% coal-fired operation. Actual emissions will depend on the
capacity factor of the facility and the extent to which biomass is burned.

Dominion also developed a
comprehensive GHG inventory for calendar year 2010. For Dominion Generation, Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s direct
CO


equivalent emissions, based on equity share (ownership),
were approximately 52.4 million metric tonnes and 32.4 million metric tonnes, respectively. For the DVP operating segment’s electric transmission and distribution operations, direct CO


equivalent emissions were approximately 0.2 million metric tonnes.
DTI’s (including Cove Point) direct CO


equivalent
emissions were approximately 3.0 million metric tonnes and East Ohio’s direct CO


equivalent emissions were approximately 1.4 million metric tonnes. While the Companies do not have final 2011 emissions data, they do not expect a significant variance in emissions from 2010
amounts. With respect to electric generation, primary facility stack emissions of CO


from carbon based fuel combustion are directly measured via continuous emissions monitor system methods set forth under 40 CFR Part 75 of the U.S. Electric Code of Federal Regulation. For those emission
sources not covered under 40 CFR Part 75, and

for methane and nitrous oxide emissions, quantification is based on fuel combustion, higher heating values, emission factors, and global warming potentials as specified in the EPA’s
Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule. For the DVP operating segment’s electric transmission and distribution emissions, the protocol used was

The Climate Registry

. For Dominion’s natural gas businesses, combustion related
emissions were calculated using the EPA Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule as described above. For DTI, the protocol used to calculate the non-combustion related emissions reported above was

Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation Guidelines
for Natural Gas Transmission and Storage, Volume 1-GHG Estimation Methodologies and Procedures-Revision 2, September 28, 2005

developed by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. For East Ohio, the protocol used to calculate
the non-combustion related emissions was the American Gas Association’s April 2008 Greenhouse Emissions Estimation Methodologies and Procedures for Natural Gas Distribution Operations.

Since 2000, the Companies have tracked the emissions of their electric generation fleet. Their electric generation
fleet employs a mix of fuel and renewable energy sources. Comparing annual year 2000 to annual year 2010, Dominion and Virginia Power’s electric generating fleet (based on ownership percentage) reduced their average CO


emissions rate per MWh of energy produced from electric generation by
about 21% and 10%, respectively. During such time period the capacity of Dominion and Virginia Power’s electric generation fleet has grown.

Alternative Energy Initiatives

In addition to the
environmental strategy described above, Dominion formed the AES department in April 2009 to conduct research in the renewable and alternative energy technologies sector and to support strategic investments to advance Dominion’s base of
understanding of such technologies. AES participates in federal and state policy development on alternative energy and identifies potential alternative energy resource and technology opportunities for Dominion’s business units. For
example, in March 2011, AES initiated a Dominion scoping study for a high-voltage underwater transmission line from Virginia Beach into the ocean to support multiple offshore wind farms; the first of many steps with the goal being the development of
a transmission line making offshore wind resources available to its customers. A 2010 Dominion study of its existing transmission system in eastern Virginia showed that it is possible to interconnect large scale wind facilities up to an installed
capability of 4,500 MW.

State Regulations

LECTRIC

Virginia Power’s electric utility retail service is subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina
Commission.



Virginia Power holds certificates of public convenience and necessity which authorize it to
maintain and operate its electric facilities now in operation and to sell electricity to customers. However, Virginia Power may not construct generating facilities or large capacity transmission lines without the prior approval of various state and
federal government agencies. In addition, the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission regulate Virginia Power’s transactions with affiliates, transfers of certain facilities and the issuance of certain securities.

Electric Regulation in Virginia

The enactment of
the Regulation Act in 2007 significantly changed electric service regulation in Virginia by instituting a modified cost-of-service rate model. With respect to most classes of customers, the Regulation Act ended Virginia’s planned transition to
retail competition for its electric supply service. Base rates are set by a process that allows Virginia Power to recover its operating costs and an ROIC. The Virginia Commission reviews Virginia Power’s base rates, terms and
conditions for generation and distribution services on a biennial basis in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Power’s actual earned ROE during a combined two-year historic test period, and
the determination of Virginia Power’s authorized ROE prospectively. If, as a result of the earnings test review, the Virginia Commission determines that Virginia Power’s historic earnings for the two-year test period are more
than 50 basis points above the authorized level, between 60% and 100% of earnings above this level must be shared with customers through a refund process. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, the Virginia Commission
may also order a base rate increase or reduction during the biennial review. Circumstances where the Virginia Commission may order a base rate decrease include a determination by the Virginia Commission that Virginia Power has exceeded its
authorized level of earnings by more than 50 basis points for two consecutive biennial review periods. Virginia Power’s authorized ROE can be set no lower than the average, for a three-year historic period, of the
actual returns reported to the SEC by not less than a majority of comparable utilities within the Southeastern U.S., with certain limitations as described in the Regulation Act. Virginia Power’s ROE may be increased or decreased
by up to 100 basis points based on operating performance criteria, or alternatively, will be increased by 50 basis points for compliance with Virginia’s RPS.

In addition, the Regulation Act authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation facilities or major unit modifications of existing facilities, FERC-approved
transmission costs, environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs. It provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures relating to the construction or major modification of facilities that
are nuclear-powered, clean coal/carbon capture compatible-powered, or renewable-powered, as well as conventional coal and combined-cycle combustion turbine facilities. Costs of fuel used for the generation of electricity, along with costs of
purchased power, are recovered from customers through an annually approved fuel rider, as provided under a separate section of the Virginia Code. Decisions of the Virginia Commission may be appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia.

If the Virginia Commission’s future rate decisions, including actions relating to Virginia Power’s rate adjustment clause
filings,

differ materially from Virginia Power’s expectations, it could adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Pursuant to the Regulation Act, the Virginia Commission initiated a review of Virginia Power’s base rates, terms and conditions in 2009, including a review of Virginia Power’s earnings for test
year 2008. In March 2010, the Virginia Commission issued the Virginia Settlement Approval Order, thus concluding the 2009 case and resolving open issues relating to Virginia Power’s base rates, fuel factor and Riders R, S, T, C1 and C2.

Pursuant to the Regulation Act and the Virginia Settlement Approval Order, in March 2011, Virginia Power submitted its base rate filing and accompanying schedules in support of the first biennial review
of its base rates, terms and conditions, as well as of its earnings for the 2009 and 2010 test period. In November 2011, the Virginia Commission issued the Biennial Review Order.

In the 2011 Biennial Review Order, the Virginia Commission determined that Virginia Power earned an ROE of approximately 13.3% during the
2009 and 2010 combined test years, which exceeded the authorized ROE earnings band of 11.4% to 12.4% established in the Virginia Settlement Approval Order, resulting in an order that Virginia Power refund 60% of earnings above the upper end of the
authorized ROE earnings band, or approximately $78 million, to its customers. The actual refund amount is expected to total approximately $81 million, taking into account refunds to be paid to certain non-jurisdictional customers pursuant to their
customer contracts. The Virginia Commission also determined that Virginia Power’s new authorized ROE is 10.9%, inclusive of a performance incentive of 50 basis points for meeting RPS targets. Subject to the outcome of Virginia Power’s
petition for rehearing or reconsideration described below, this ROE will serve as the ROE against which Virginia Power’s earned return will be compared for all or part of the test periods in the 2013 biennial review proceeding.

With respect to Virginia Power’s rate adjustment clauses, the Virginia Commission determined that, effective December 1, 2011, the
ROE applicable to Riders C1 and C2 is 10.4% and the ROE applicable to Riders R and S is 11.4%, inclusive of a statutory enhancement of 100 basis points. The Virginia Commission also found that, as a result of its determination that credits will
be applied to customers’ bills, the Regulation Act requires the combination of its existing Riders T, C1, and C2 with Virginia Power’s base costs, revenues and investments, and these Riders will thereafter be considered part of Virginia
Power’s base costs, revenues and investments for purposes of future biennial review proceedings. Accordingly, the Virginia Commission directed that Virginia Power’s tariff filings pursuant to the Biennial Review Order reflect such
combination. The Virginia Commission has initiated a proceeding to address further implementation of this directive. As a result of the Virginia Settlement Approval Order and the Regulation Act, Virginia Power’s base rates will otherwise remain
unchanged through at least December 1, 2013.

In December 2011, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission
seeking rehearing or reconsideration of the Biennial Review Order, to clarify whether the effective date of the



newly authorized base ROE is prospective from the date the Virginia Commission issued the Biennial Review Order or retrospective to January 1, 2011. Also, in December 2011, Virginia Power filed
with the Virginia Commission a Notice of Appeal of the Biennial Review Order to the Supreme Court of Virginia.

the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Electric Regulation in North Carolina

Virginia Power’s retail electric base rates in North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to North Carolina
statutes and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. North Carolina base rates are set by a process that allows Virginia Power to recover its operating costs and an ROIC. If retail electric earnings exceed the returns
established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Power’s future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina
Commission does not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, Virginia Power’s future earnings could be negatively impacted. Fuel rates are subject to revision under annual fuel cost adjustment proceedings.
Virginia Power intends to file an application with the North Carolina Commission by March 30, 2012, to increase its base rates. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Dominion’s gas
distribution services are regulated by the Ohio Commission and the West Virginia Commission.

Status of Competitive Retail Gas Services

Both of the states in which Dominion has gas distribution operations have considered legislation regarding a competitive deregulation of
natural gas sales at the retail level.

Ohio

—Ohio has not enacted legislation requiring supplier choice for
residential or commercial natural gas consumers. However, in cooperation with the Ohio Commission, Dominion offers retail choice to residential and commercial customers. At December 31, 2011, approximately 1.0 million of Dominion’s
1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in this Energy Choice program. In October 2006, East Ohio implemented a program approved by the Ohio Commission as a transitional step towards the improvement and expansion of the Energy Choice
program, under which East Ohio entered into gas purchase contracts with selected suppliers at a fixed price above the NYMEX month-end settlement. This Standard Service Offer pricing mechanism replaced the traditional gas cost recovery rate with a
monthly market price that eliminated the true-up adjustment, making it easier for customers to compare and switch to competitive suppliers if they so choose.

In June 2008, the Ohio Commission approved a settlement filed in response to East Ohio’s application seeking approval of Phase 2 of its plan to restructure its commodity service. Under that
settlement, the existing Standard Service Offer program was continued through March 2009 with an update to the fixed rate adder to the NYMEX price. Starting in April 2009, East Ohio buys natural gas under the Standard Service Offer program for
customers not eligible to participate in the Energy Choice program and places Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct

retail relationship with selected suppliers, which is designated on the customers’ bills. Subject to the Ohio Commission’s approval, East Ohio may eventually exit the gas merchant
function in Ohio entirely and have all customers select an alternate gas supplier. East Ohio continues to be the provider of last resort in the event of default by a supplier. Large industrial customers in Ohio also source their own natural gas
supplies.

West Virginia

—At this time, West Virginia has not enacted legislation to require customers to choose in
the retail natural gas markets served by Hope. However, the West Virginia Commission has issued regulations to govern pooling services, one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customers a choice in the future and
has issued rules requiring competitive gas service providers to be licensed in West Virginia.

Rates

Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries are subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of their businesses by the states in which they operate
- Ohio and West Virginia. When necessary, Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries seek general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost of service
by rate class. A straight-fixed-variable rate design, in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through a monthly charge rather than a volumetric charge, is utilized to establish rates for a majority of East Ohio’s customers
pursuant to a 2008 rate case settlement. Base rates for Hope are designed primarily based on a rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. In addition to general rate increases,
Dominion’s gas distribution subsidiaries make routine separate filings with their respective state regulatory commissions to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas. The majority of these purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery
through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The purchased gas cost recovery filings generally cover prospective
one-, three- or twelve-month periods. Approved increases or decreases in gas cost recovery rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses. The Ohio Commission has also
approved several stand-alone cost recovery mechanisms to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure projects and certain other costs that vary widely over time; such costs are excluded from general base rates. See Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Under the Federal Power Act, FERC
regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Virginia Power purchases and sells electricity in the PJM wholesale market and Dominion’s merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM,
MISO and ISO-NE wholesale markets under Dominion’s market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC. In addition, Virginia Power has FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded cost of



generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Power’s service territory. Any such sales would be voluntary.

Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to FERC’s Standards of Conduct that govern conduct between transmission function employees of
interstate gas and electricity transmission providers and the marketing function employees of their affiliates. The rule defines the scope of transmission and marketing-related functions that are covered by the standards and is designed to prevent
transmission providers from giving their affiliates undue preferences.

Dominion and Virginia Power are also subject to
FERC’s affiliate restrictions that (1) prohibit power sales between Virginia Power and Dominion’s merchant plants without first receiving FERC authorization, (2) require the merchant plants and Virginia Power to conduct their
wholesale power sales operations separately, and (3) prohibit Virginia Power from sharing market information with merchant plant operating personnel. The rules are designed to prohibit Virginia Power from giving the merchant plants a
competitive advantage.

EPACT included provisions to create an ERO. The ERO is required to promulgate mandatory reliability
standards governing the operation of the bulk power system in the U.S. FERC has certified NERC as the ERO and also issued an initial order approving many reliability standards that went into effect in 2007. Entities that violate standards will be
subject to fines of between $1 thousand and $1 million per day, and can also be assessed non-monetary penalties, depending upon the nature and severity of the violation.

Dominion and Virginia Power plan and operate their facilities in compliance with approved NERC reliability requirements. Dominion and Virginia Power employees participate on various NERC committees, track
the development and implementation of standards, and maintain proper compliance registration with NERC’s regional organizations. Dominion and Virginia Power anticipate incurring additional compliance expenditures over the next several years as
a result of the implementation of new cybersecurity programs as well as efforts to ensure appropriate facility ratings for Virginia Power’s transmission lines. In October 2010, NERC issued an industry alert identifying possible discrepancies
between the design and actual field conditions of transmission facilities as a potential reliability issue. The alert recommends that entities review their current facilities rating methodology to verify that the methodology is based on actual field
conditions, rather than solely on design documents, and to take corrective action if necessary. Virginia Power is evaluating its transmission facilities for any discrepancies between design and actual field conditions. In addition, NERC has
requested the industry to increase the number of assets subject to NERC reliability standards that are designated as critical assets, including cybersecurity assets. While Dominion and Virginia Power expect to incur additional compliance costs in
connection with the above NERC requirements and initiatives, such expenses are not expected to significantly affect results of operations.

In April 2008, FERC granted an application for Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual
basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January 1, 2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the

expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a
current return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure.

Gas

FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended. Under the Natural Gas Act,
FERC has authority over rates, terms and conditions of services performed by Dominion’s interstate natural gas company subsidiaries, including DTI, Cove Point and the Dominion South Pipeline Company, LP. FERC also has jurisdiction over siting,
construction and operation of natural gas import facilities and interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.

Dominion’s
interstate gas transmission and storage activities are generally conducted on an open access basis, in accordance with certificates, tariffs and service agreements on file with FERC.

Dominion is also subject to the Pipeline Safety Acts of 2002 and 2011, which mandate inspections of interstate and intrastate natural gas
transmission and storage pipelines, particularly those located in areas of high-density population. Dominion has evaluated its natural gas transmission and storage properties, as required by the Department of Transportation regulations under these
Acts, and has implemented a program of identification, testing and potential remediation activities. These activities are ongoing.

Environmental Regulations

Each of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operating segments faces
substantial laws, regulations and compliance costs with respect to environmental matters. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance,
including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the Companies. If expenditures for pollution control technologies and associated
operating costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated rates (in regulated jurisdictions) or market prices (in deregulated jurisdictions), those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows. Dominion and
Virginia Power have applied for or obtained the necessary environmental permits for the operation of their facilities. Many of these permits are subject to reissuance and continuing review. For a discussion of significant aspects of these matters,
including current and planned capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance required to be discussed in this Item, see

protect the environment and address climate change while meeting the future needs of their growing service territory. Dominion’s CEO and operating segment CEOs are responsible for compliance with the laws and regulations governing environmental
matters, including climate change, and Dominion’s Board of Directors receives periodic updates on these matters. See

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

All aspects of the operation and maintenance of Dominion’s and
Virginia Powers’ nuclear power stations, which are part of the Dominion Generation segment, are regulated by the NRC. Operating licenses issued by the NRC are subject to revocation, suspension or modification, and the operation of a nuclear
unit may be suspended if the NRC determines that the public interest, health or safety so requires.

From time to time, the NRC
adopts new requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. In many cases, these new regulations require changes in the design, operation and maintenance of existing nuclear facilities. If the NRC adopts such requirements in the
future, it could result in substantial increases in the cost of operating and maintaining Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear generating units. See

Nuclear Matters

in

Future Issues

and Other Matters

in MD&A for
further information.

The NRC also requires Dominion and Virginia Power to decontaminate their nuclear facilities once
operations cease. This process is referred to as decommissioning, and the Companies are required by the NRC to be financially prepared. For information on decommissioning trusts, see

Dominion Generation-Nuclear Decommissioning

and Note 10 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on spent nuclear fuel.

Item 1A. Risk
Factors

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve
uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any
forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see

Forward-Looking Statements

in Item 7. MD&A.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather.

Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, and affect the price of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can be
destructive, causing outages and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Droughts can result in reduced water levels that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies’ power stations. Furthermore, the
Companies’ operations could be adversely

affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather
patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level.

Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to complex governmental regulation that could
adversely affect their results of operations.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous
permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated
regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. However, new laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of
existing laws or regulations, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial expense.

Dominion and Virginia Power could be subject to penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards.

As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of generation facilities and bulk electric transmission systems, including Dominion and Virginia Power, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enacted
by NERC and enforced by FERC. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject the Companies to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If either Dominion or Virginia Power is found not to be in
compliance with the mandatory reliability standards it could be subject to remediation costs, as well as sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance with future environmental
laws, including laws and regulations designed to address global climate change, air quality, coal combustion by-products, cooling water and other matters could make certain of the Companies’ generation facilities uneconomical to maintain or
operate.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality,
water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and
operation of pollution control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified
by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and Dominion and Virginia Power expect that they will remain significant in the future.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable to Dominion or Virginia
Power. The EPA is expected to issue additional regulations with respect to air quality under the CAA, including revised NAAQS and regulations governing the emissions of GHGs from electric generating units. Risks relating to potential regulation of
GHG emissions are discussed below. Dominion and



Virginia Power also expect additional federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures and coal combustion by-product handling and disposal
practices that are expected to be applicable to at least some of its generating facilities.

Compliance costs cannot be
estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty
include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies’
generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.

If additional federal and/or state requirements are imposed on energy companies
mandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements, such requirements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s electric generation units or
natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate.

The EPA, environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some state and other federal agencies are focusing considerable
attention on GHG emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that additional EPA regulations, and possibly additional state legislation and/or regulations, may be issued
resulting in the imposition of additional limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.

There are also potential impacts on Dominion’s natural gas businesses as federal or state GHG legislation or
regulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products. Several regions of
the U.S. have moved forward with GHG emission regulations including regions where Dominion has operations. For example, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have implemented regulations requiring reductions in CO


emissions through RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO


emissions from power plants in the Northeast, which affects several of
Dominion’s facilities.

Compliance with GHG emission reduction requirements may require increasing the energy efficiency
of equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon capture and storage technology, purchase of allowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with
lower emitting generation facilities. The cost of compliance with GHG emission legislation and/or regulation is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the
implementation of rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon capture and storage technology, and the selected compliance alternatives. The Companies cannot estimate
the aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However,

such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies’ generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominion’s or
Virginia Power’s results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.

The rates of Virginia Power are subject to regulatory review.

In the Biennial Review Order, the Virginia Commission determined that Virginia Power’s actual ROE during the 2009 and 2010 combined test years exceeded the upper end of the authorized ROE earnings
band for that period, resulting in an order that Virginia Power refund approximately $78 million to its customers. The Virginia Commission also determined that Virginia Power’s new authorized ROE is 10.9%, inclusive of a performance incentive
of 50 basis points for meeting certain renewable energy targets. Subject to the outcome of the petition for rehearing or reconsideration described below, this ROE will serve as the ROE against which Virginia Power’s earned return will be
compared for all or part of the test periods in the 2013 biennial review proceeding. In December 2011, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission seeking a rehearing or reconsideration of the Biennial Review Order to clarify
whether the effective date of the newly authorized ROE is the date the Virginia Commission issued the 2011 Biennial Review Order or January 1, 2011. If the Virginia Commission orders that the effective date of the newly authorized ROE is January 1,
2011, such effective date may adversely affect the outcome of the earnings test in the 2013 biennial review. In addition, Virginia Power’s base rates are subject to reduction if the Virginia Commission concludes, in the 2013 biennial review,
that Virginia Power’s actual ROE during the test period exceeded the upper end of the authorized ROE earnings band for that period, under circumstances described in the Regulation Act. The Virginia Commission could also order Virginia Power to
refund to customers 60% of any such excess earnings for the 2011-2012 earnings test period. The Virginia Commission may alternatively order Virginia Power to refund up to 100% of earnings that exceed the earnings band in a biennial review if it
finds that Virginia Power’s total aggregate regulated rates have exceeded annual increases in the U.S. Consumer Price Index, as described in the Regulation Act.

In the 2011 Biennial Review Order, as a result of the Virginia Commission’s determination that credits will be applied to customers’ bills, the Virginia Commission, as required by the Regulation
Act, directed Virginia Power to combine its existing Riders T, C1, and C2 with Virginia Power’s base costs, revenues and investments, and to file revised tariffs reflecting such combination. These existing Riders will thereafter be considered
part of Virginia Power’s base costs, revenues and investments for purposes of future biennial review proceedings. The Virginia Commission has initiated a proceeding to address how this combination will be implemented. Depending on how the
Virginia Commission orders the combination of existing Riders T, C1 and C2 to be effected, Virginia Power may be required to discontinue deferral accounting and could potentially not receive full recovery of costs associated with these existing
riders. At this time, Virginia Power is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of the outcome of these proceedings.

The rates of Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations and Dominion’s gas transmission and distribution operations are subject to regulatory review.

Revenue provided by Virginia Power’s electric



transmission operations and Dominion’s gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by federal and state regulatory agencies. The profitability of these
businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.

Virginia Power’s wholesale charges for electric transmission service are adjusted on an annual basis through operation of a
FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia Power’s wholesale electric transmission cost of service is estimated and thereafter adjusted as appropriate to reflect actual costs allocated to Virginia Power by PJM. These
wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Power’s wholesale revenue requirement is
no longer just and reasonable.

Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominion’s gas transmission businesses
are subject to review by FERC. In addition, Dominion’s gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

Risks arising from the reliability of electric generation, transmission and distribution equipment, supply chain disruptions or personnel issues could
result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs.

Operation of the Companies’ generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves risk,
including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage,
construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. In
addition, weather-related incidents, earthquakes and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution facilities. Because Virginia Power’s transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the
operation of its facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.

Operation of the Companies’ generation facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of
generating units and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies’ business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies’ operation
and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less energy or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement energy and capacity from third
parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result.

Dominion’s merchant power business is operating in a challenging market, which
could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth.

The success of Dominion’s merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability
to

purchase and sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the
credit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.

In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next
unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for
electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does not
enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.

Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtained
through short-term contracts or on the spot market. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominion’s financial
results.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s generation business may
be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change market

design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or
revenue calculations in the RTO markets

. Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale
electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets in PJM, MISO and
ISO-NE depend upon FERC’s continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize PJM, MISO and ISO-NE to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominion’s authority to
sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets, Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations,
could adversely impact the future results of Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s generation business.

War, acts and threats of terrorism, natural disaster and other significant events could adversely affect Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operations.

Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies’ business in particular. Any retaliatory
military strikes or sustained military campaign may affect the Companies’ operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, infrastructure facilities, such as
electric generation, electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Furthermore, the physical or cybersecurity compromise of the Companies’ facilities could
adversely affect the Companies’ ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financial
mar-



kets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of
insurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companies’ results of operations and financial condition.

Dominion and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to
dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power,
the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks;
however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If Dominion and Virginia Power are not allowed to recover the additional costs
incurred through insurance, or in the case of Virginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under
federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take
some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion and Virginia Power to make substantial
expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or
financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of
domestic nuclear units.

The use of derivative instruments could result in
financial losses and liquidity constraints.

Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity and financial
market risks. In addition, Dominion purchases and sells commodity-based contracts primarily in the natural gas market for trading purposes. The Companies could recognize financial losses on these contracts, including as a result of volatility in the
market values of the underlying commodities, if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract or upon the failure or insolvency of a financial intermediary, exchange or clearinghouse used to enter, execute or clear these transactions. In the
absence of actively-quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these contracts involves management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the
under-

lying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.

The use of derivatives to hedge future sales may limit the benefit Dominion would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices. These hedge arrangements generally include collateral requirements
that require Dominion to deposit funds or post letters of credit with counterparties, financial intermediaries or clearinghouses to cover the fair value of covered contracts in excess of agreed upon credit limits. For instance, when commodity prices
rise to levels substantially higher than the levels where it has hedged future sales, Dominion may be required to use a material portion of its available liquidity or obtain additional liquidity to cover these collateral requirements. In some
circumstances, this could have a compounding effect on Dominion’s financial liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the availability or security of the collateral delivered by Dominion may be adversely affected by the failure or
insolvency of a financial intermediary, exchange or clearinghouse used to enter, execute or clear these types of transactions.

Derivatives designated under hedge accounting, to the extent not fully offset by the hedged transaction, can result in ineffectiveness
losses. These losses primarily result from differences between the location and/or specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item and could adversely affect Dominion’s results of operations.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operations in regards to these transactions are subject to multiple market risks including
market liquidity, price volatility, credit strength of the Companies’ counterparties and the financial condition of the financial intermediaries, exchanges and clearinghouses used for the types of transactions. These market risks are beyond the
Companies’ control and could adversely affect their results of operations, liquidity and future growth.

The Dodd-Frank
Act, which was enacted into law in July 2010, includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Final rules for the
over-the-counter derivatives-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the clearing, exchange trading and capital and margin requirements, will be established through the on-going rulemaking process of each applicable regulator, including
the CFTC and SEC. In June 2011, both the CFTC and SEC confirmed that they would not complete the required rulemakings by the July 2011 deadline under the Dodd-Frank Act. Each agency has granted temporary relief from most derivative-related
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act until the effective date of the applicable rules. Currently, the CFTC’s temporary relief would expire no later than July 16, 2012, if not extended. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominion’s or
Virginia Power’s derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs for their derivative activities, including from higher margin requirements. In
addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the over-the-counter derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies’ swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies’ derivative activities.

Dominion depends on third parties to produce the natural gas it gathers and
processes, and the NGLs it fractionates at its facilities. A reduction in these quantities could reduce Dominion’s revenues.



Dominion obtains its supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Such producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or NGLs to
Dominion’s facilities, although the producers that have contracted to supply natural gas to Dominion’s natural gas processing and fractionation facility under development in Natrium, West Virginia will generally be subject to contractual
minimum fee payments. If producers were to decrease the supply of natural gas or NGLs to Dominion’s systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion could experience lower revenues to the extent it is unable to replace the lost volumes on
similar terms.

Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect
the Companies’ financial results of operations.

Dominion and Virginia Power are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail
or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of
regulations on their operations. Such defaults by customers, suppliers or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results.

Dominion and Virginia Power may not complete plant construction or expansion projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially
different terms or timing than initially anticipated and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed.

Several plant construction and
expansion projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. Projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays
in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of their counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond their control. Even if plant construction and expansion
projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of Dominion and Virginia Power following the projects may not meet expectations. Additionally, Dominion and Virginia Power may
not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a
project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the plant construction and expansion projects.

Energy conservation could negatively impact Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s
financial results.

Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Additionally,
technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices, including lighting and electric heat pumps, could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. To the extent conservation
results in reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand, the value of the Companies’ business activities could be adversely impacted.

An inability to access financial markets could adversely affect the execution of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s business plans.

Dominion and Virginia Power rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for capital expenditures, normal working

capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies’ creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit
rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s control could increase their cost of
borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit
market or political events, or the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies’ ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute
their business plans as scheduled.

Market performance and other changes may
decrease the value of decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets or increase Dominion’s liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission
Dominion’s nuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will
yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates.

With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in
the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission Dominion’s nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance.

A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominion’s pension and other
postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Dominion’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the
liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations
related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are
negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, Dominion’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected.

Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s growth and business strategy.

In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, Dominion and Virginia Power may find it necessary
to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in Dominion’s credit ratings or the credit ratings of Virginia Power could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of
access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require Dominion to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.

Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect Dominion’s and
Virginia Power’s financial results.

Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies



in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These
changes in accounting standards could adversely affect reported earnings or could increase reported liabilities.

Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operations.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the
inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results.

Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential

information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s business.

The
Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies’ facilities are not completely isolated from external networks.
Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or the Companies’ operations could view the Companies’ computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. In addition, the Companies’ business
requires that they collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.

A successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies’ electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing
the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies’ ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in
significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies’ reputation. In addition, the
misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. The Companies maintain property and
casualty insurance that may cover certain damage caused by potential cybersecurity incidents, however, other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a
significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations.

In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, the Companies have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of data and systems. In addition, Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to mandatory cybersecurity regulatory requirements. However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that the Companies
could experience a successful cyber attack despite their current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

From time to time, Dominion and Virginia Power are alleged to be in violation or in default under orders, statutes, rules or regulations relating to the
environment, compliance plans imposed upon or agreed to by the Companies, or permits issued by various local, state and/or federal agencies for the construction or operation of facilities. Administrative proceedings may also be pending on these
matters. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Companies and their subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings.

In February 2008, Dominion received a request for information pursuant to Section 114 of the CAA from the EPA. The request concerns historical operating changes and capital improvements undertaken at
State Line and Kincaid. In April 2009, Dominion received a second request for information. Dominion provided information in response to both requests. Also in April 2009, Dominion received a Notice and Finding of Violations from the EPA claiming
violations of the CAA New Source Review requirements, New Source Performance Standards, and Title V permit program and the stations’ respective State Implementation Plans. The Notice states that the EPA may issue an order requiring compliance
with the relevant CAA provisions and may seek injunctive relief and/or civil penalties, all pursuant to the EPA’s enforcement authority under the CAA.

Dominion believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The CAA authorizes maximum civil penalties of
$25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. In addition to any such penalties that may be awarded, an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures or affect the
timing of currently budgeted capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Dominion is currently unable to make an estimate of the
potential financial statement impacts related to these matters.

Dominion and Virginia Power have identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of
the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to their financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using
different assumptions. Dominion and Virginia Power have discussed the



development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committees of their Boards of Directors. Virginia Power’s Board of Directors also serves as its Audit
Committee.

PERATIONS

The accounting for Virginia Power’s regulated electric and Dominion’s regulated gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated
operations in that they are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to
accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs are deferred as
regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from
customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.

The Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future rates is probable and make various assumptions in their analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally
based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period
such assessment is made. See Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

BLIGATIONS

Dominion and Virginia Power recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring
tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of
quoted market prices, the Companies estimate the fair value of their AROs using present value techniques, in which they make various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement
activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When the Companies revise any
assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, they adjust the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset. The Companies accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time.

In 2011, 2010 and 2009, Dominion recognized $84 million, $85 million and $89 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize
$75 million in 2012. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, Virginia Power recognized $36 million, $35 million and $35 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $35 million in 2012. Virginia Power records accretion and depreciation
associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs as an adjustment to its regulatory liability for nuclear decommissioning.

A significant portion of the Companies’ AROs relates to the future decommissioning of
Dominion’s merchant and Virginia Power’s utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December 31, 2011, Dominion’s nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled
$1.2 billion, representing approximately 83% of its total AROs. At December 31, 2011, Virginia Power’s nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $559 million, representing approximately 89% of its total AROs. Based on their significance,
the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with the Companies’ nuclear decommissioning obligations.

The Companies obtain from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and
timing of planned decommissioning activities for their nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature
highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, the Companies’ cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. The Companies determine cost escalation rates, which represent
projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are
considered to be a critical assumption.

In December 2011, Dominion recorded a decrease of $290 million in the nuclear
decommissioning AROs for its units. Virginia Power recorded a decrease of $95 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. The ARO revision was driven by a reduction in anticipated future decommissioning costs due to the expected
future recovery from the DOE of certain spent fuel costs based on the Companies’ contracts with the DOE for disposal of spent nuclear fuel, as well as updated escalation rates. In 2009, as a result of updated decommissioning cost studies and
applicable escalation rates, Dominion recorded a decrease of $309 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs of its units, including a $103 million ($62 million after-tax) reduction in other operations and maintenance expense due to a downward
revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a power station unit that is no longer in service. Virginia Power recorded a decrease of $119 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units.

Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The
interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to
tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.

Given the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and
filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are
recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely- than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be

examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2011, Dominion had $347 million and Virginia Power had $114 million of unrecognized tax
benefits.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary
differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion and Virginia Power evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial
results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax
planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. The Companies establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2011,
Dominion had established $96 million of valuation allowances and Virginia Power had no valuation allowances.

Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative contracts such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage commodity and financial market risks of
their business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further
clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear decommissioning and Dominion’s rabbi and benefit plan trust funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See
Notes 7 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.

Fair value
is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing
information provided by brokers and other pricing services, the Companies consider whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which
brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is
required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, the Companies must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect
their market assumptions.

The Companies maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value.

As of December 31, 2011, Dominion reported $3.1 billion of goodwill in its
Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000.

In April of each
year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if

an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2011, 2010 and 2009 annual tests
and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.

In general, Dominion estimates the fair
value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. For
Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations and Peoples and Hope operations, negotiated sales prices were used as fair value for the tests conducted in 2010 and 2009. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as
Dominion’s estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time;
subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion’s estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion has consistently applied the same methods
in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by
nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those
reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Impairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when
circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset’s carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset’s fair value
is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the
undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations
in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly
uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, and
expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets.

Dominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and
qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions
about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on
employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion’s assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service
period of plan participants, rather than immediately.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates
and healthcare cost trend rates are critical assumptions. Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:

Ÿ

Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions;

Ÿ

Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes;

Ÿ

Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations;

Ÿ

Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indices; and

Ÿ

Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion’s pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity,
33% fixed income, 3% real estate and 18% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments.

Strategic investment policies are established for Dominion’s prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies.
Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
Deviations from the plans’ strategic allocation are a function of Dominion’s assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans’ actual
asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and
other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.

Dominion develops assumptions, which are
then compared to the forecasts of other independent investment advisors to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
assumption of 8.50% for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.75% for 2011, 2010 and 2009. The rate used in

calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan
assets.

Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments
to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost were 5.9% in 2011 and 6.60% in 2010 and 2009. Dominion selected a discount rate of 5.50% for determining its December 31, 2011
projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

Dominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption
based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion’s healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of
December 31, 2011 is 7% and is expected to gradually decrease to 4.60% by 2060 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.

The following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant:

In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2011, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would
increase Dominion’s projected pension benefit obligation by $163 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $43 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by $174 million. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Virginia Power recognizes and records revenues when energy is delivered to the customer. The determination of sales to individual customers is based on
the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, the amount of electric energy delivered to customers, but not yet billed, is estimated and recorded as unbilled revenue. This
estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings. Virginia Power’s customer receivables included $360 million and $397 million of accrued unbilled revenue at December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively.

The calculation of unbilled revenues is complex and includes numerous estimates and assumptions including
historical usage, applicable customer rates, weather factors and total daily electric generation supplied, adjusted for line losses. Changes in generation patterns, customer usage patterns and other factors, which are the basis for the estimates of
unbilled revenues, could have a significant effect on the calculation and therefore on Virginia Power’s results of operations and financial condition.

operations and impairment charges related to certain merchant generation facilities.

Analysis of Consolidated Operations

Presented below are selected amounts related to Dominion’s results of operations:

An analysis of Dominion’s results of operations follows:


VS

. 2010

Net Revenue

decreased 7%, primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

A $519 million decrease from merchant generation operations, primarily due to a decrease in realized prices ($347 million) and lower generation ($163
million); and

Ÿ

A $125 million decrease reflecting the sale of substantially all of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010.

These decreases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

A $32 million increase from Dominion’s gas transmission business primarily related to an increase in revenue from NGLs;

Ÿ

A $28 million increase in producer services primarily related to higher physical margins and favorable price changes on economic hedging positions, all
associated with natural gas aggregation, marketing and trading activities;

Ÿ

A $13 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

The impact of rate adjustment clauses ($169 million); and

Ÿ

A decrease in net capacity expenses ($44 million); partially offset by

Ÿ

The impact ($120 million) of a decrease in sales to retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in heating and cooling degree days ($220 million),
partially offset by an increase in sales due to the effect of favorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($100 million); and

Ÿ

A decrease due to a charge based on the Biennial Review Order to refund revenues to customers ($81 million).



Other operations and
maintenance

decreased 6%, primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

A $441 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits primarily related to a 2010 workforce reduction program; partially offset by

Ÿ

A $96 million increase due to restoration costs associated with damage caused by Hurricane Irene; and

Ÿ

An $89 million net increase in impairment charges related to certain utility and merchant coal-fired generating units.

Gain on sale of Appalachian E&P operations

reflects a gain on the sale of these operations, as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest and related charges

increased 4%, primarily due to the absence of a benefit
recorded in 2010 resulting from the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain interest rate derivatives ($73 million) and an increase in debt issuances in 2011 ($18 million), partially offset by the recognition of hedging gains that had
previously been deferred as regulatory liabilities as a result of the Biennial Review Order ($50 million).

Income tax expense

decreased $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting lower federal and state taxes largely due to the absence of a gain from the sale of
Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations recorded in 2010.

Loss from
discontinued operations

reflects the sale of Peoples in 2010.


VS

. 2009

Net Revenue

increased 8%, primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

A $1.1 billion increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

The absence of a charge for the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case proceedings ($570 million);

Ÿ

The impact of rate adjustment clauses ($279 million);

Ÿ

An increase in sales to retail customers primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days ($248 million); and

Ÿ

An increase in ancillary revenues received from PJM ($78 million), primarily reflecting an increase in the scheduled dispatch of gas and oil-fired
generation units to meet higher demand; partially offset by

Ÿ

A decrease primarily due to the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($75 million);

Ÿ

A $98 million increase from regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily reflecting increased rider revenue associated with the recovery of
bad debt expense ($60 million) and an increase in base rates ($40 million); and

Ÿ

A $46 million increase related to natural gas transmission operations largely due to the completion of the Cove Point expansion project.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

A $356 million decrease from merchant generation operations due to a decrease at certain nuclear generating facilities ($237 million) primarily due to
lower realized prices, a decline in margins at certain fossil generation facilities ($70 million) primarily due to an increase in fuel prices and the expiration of certain requirements-based power sales contracts in December 2009 ($49 million);

Ÿ

A $222 million decrease reflecting the sale of substantially all of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010; and

Ÿ

A $40 million decrease in producer services primarily related to unfavorable price changes on economic hedging positions and lower physical margins,
all associated with natural gas aggregation, marketing and trading activities.

Other operations and maintenance

increased $12 million primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

A $240 million net increase in salaries, wages and benefits primarily related to a workforce reduction program;

Ÿ

Impairment charges related to certain merchant generating facilities ($194 million);

Ÿ

A $103 million increase due to the absence of a benefit in 2009 from a downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a unit that is no
longer in service;

Ÿ

A $56 million increase in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily related to low income assistance programs ($60
million). These expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income; and

Ÿ

A $42 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

A $434 million decrease in ceiling test impairment charges related to the carrying value of Dominion’s E&P properties;

Ÿ

The absence of a $142 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case
proceedings; and

Ÿ

A $48 million decrease in outage costs due to a decrease in scheduled outage days primarily at certain merchant generation facilities.

DD&A

decreased 7%, primarily due to the sale of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations ($45 million) and lower amortization due to decreased cost of emissions allowances consumed ($37 million).

Other taxes

increased 10%, primarily due to additional property tax from increased investments and higher rates ($16 million), an increase in gross receipts tax due to new non-regulated retail energy customers ($14 million) and higher payroll taxes associated
with a workforce reduction program ($12 million).

Gain on sale of
Appalachian E&P operations

reflects a gain on the sale of these operations, as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other income

decreased
13%, primarily reflecting an increase in charitable contributions ($46 million) and a decrease in interest income ($15 million); partially offset by the absence of an impairment loss on an equity method investment ($30 million) and higher realized
gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($12 million).

Interest and related charges

decreased 6%, primarily due to a benefit resulting from the net effect of the discontinuance of hedge accounting for
certain interest rate hedges and subsequent changes in fair value of these interest rate derivatives ($73 million), partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the June 2009 hybrid issuance ($26 million).



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

Income tax expense

increased $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher federal and state taxes largely due to the gain on the sale of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P business.

Loss from discontinued operations

primarily reflects a loss on the sale of Peoples.

Outlook

Dominion’s strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated
businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide earnings per share growth, a growing dividend and to maintain a stable credit profile. Dominion’s 2011 results were negatively impacted by lower margins from merchant generation operations
and less favorable weather on electric utility operations. In 2012, Dominion is expected to experience an increase in net income on a per share basis as compared to 2011. Dominion’s anticipated 2012 results reflect the following significant
factors:

Ÿ

The absence of charges incurred in 2011 related to expected plant retirements, impairment of emissions allowances and Hurricane Irene;

Ÿ

Construction and operation of growth projects in electric utility operations and associated rate adjustment clause revenue, as well as growth projects
in gas transmission and distribution operations;

Ÿ

Growth in weather-normalized electric utility sales of 2-2.5% resulting from the recovering economy and rising energy demand;

Ÿ

Reductions in certain operations and maintenance expenses; and

Ÿ

A reduction in interest expense; partially offset by

Ÿ

Lower realized margins from merchant generation operations due to lower commodity prices and the retirement of certain coal units; and

Ÿ

An increase in DD&A.

Dominion expects the bonus depreciation provisions of the tax legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2010, discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to reduce income taxes
otherwise payable, resulting in cash savings in 2012 and 2013 of approximately $475 million and $700 million, respectively.

A $267 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits as well as certain administrative and general costs primarily due to a 2010 workforce reduction
program; and

Ÿ

A $54 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to fewer scheduled outage days at certain generation facilities; partially offset by

Ÿ

A $228 million impairment charge related to certain coal-fired generating units; and

Ÿ

A $96 million increase due to restoration costs associated with damage caused by Hurricane Irene.

Depreciation and amortization expense

increased 7%, primarily due to property additions.

Other income

decreased 12%, primarily due to a decrease in the equity component of AFUDC ($17 million), partially offset by an increase in amounts
collectible from customers for taxes in connection with contributions in aid of construction ($5 million).

. 2009

Net Revenue

increased 33%, primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

The absence of a charge for the settlement of the 2009 base rate case proceedings ($570 million);

Ÿ

The impact of rate adjustment clauses ($279 million);

Ÿ

An increase in sales to retail customers primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days ($248 million); and

Ÿ

An increase in ancillary revenues received from PJM ($78 million), primarily reflecting an increase in the scheduled dispatch of gas and oil-fired
generation units to meet higher demand.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

A decrease primarily due to the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($75 million).

Other operations and maintenance

increased 8%, primarily reflecting:

Ÿ

A $177 million net increase in salaries, wages and benefits primarily due to a workforce reduction program;

Ÿ

A $42 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures; and

Ÿ

A $19 million increase in storm damage and service restoration costs.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

The absence of a $130 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power’s 2009 base rate case
proceedings.

Depreciation and amortization expense

increased 5%, primarily due to property additions.

Other taxes

increased 14%, primarily reflecting additional property tax due to increased investments and higher rates ($12 million), incremental use tax that is recoverable through a customer surcharge ($8 million)
and higher payroll taxes associated with a workforce reduction program ($7 million).

Income tax expense

increased $395 million, primarily reflecting higher pretax income in 2010.

Outlook

Virginia Power expects to provide growth
in net income in 2012. Virginia Power’s anticipated 2012 results reflect the following significant factors:

Ÿ

The absence of charges incurred in 2011 related to expected plant retirements, impairment of emissions allowances and Hurricane Irene;

Ÿ

Growth in weather-normalized electric sales of 2-2.5% resulting from the recovering economy and rising energy demand; and

Ÿ

Construction and operation of growth projects and associated rate adjustment clause revenue; partially offset by

Ÿ

An increase in planned outages at certain nuclear facilities.

Virginia Power expects the bonus depreciation provisions of the tax legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2010, discussed in Note 6
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to reduce income taxes otherwise payable, resulting in cash savings of approximately $500 million in 2012.

ESOURCES

Dominion and Virginia Power depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital
requirements. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities.

At December 31, 2011, Dominion had $1.7 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities, including $341 million of unused
capacity under joint credit facilities available to Virginia Power. See additional discussion under

Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt

.

A summary of Dominion’s cash flows is presented below:

(1)

2009 amount includes $5 million of cash classified as held for sale in Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2)

2009 amount includes $2 million of cash classified as held for sale in Dominion’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

A summary of Virginia Power’s cash flows is presented below:

Operating Cash Flows

In 2011, net cash provided by Dominion’s operating activities increased by $1.2 billion, primarily due to lower income tax payments, lower payments
related to the Virginia Settlement Approval Order, and the absence of contributions to pension plans made in 2010; partially offset by lower merchant generation margins and the impact of less favorable weather on electric utility operations.

In 2011, net cash provided by Virginia Power’s operating activities increased by $615 million, primarily due to higher
deferred fuel cost recoveries in its Virginia jurisdiction, lower payments related to the Virginia Settlement Approval Order, and the absence of contributions to Dominion’s pension plans made in 2010. The increase was partially offset by the
impact of less favorable weather, higher restoration costs due to Hurricane Irene, and net changes in other working capital items.



Dominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to
planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In 2010, Dominion’s Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy that raised its target payout ratio. In 2012, the Board affirmed the dividend policy
and established an annual dividend rate of $2.11 per share of common stock, a 7.1% increase over the 2011 rate. Declarations of dividends are subject to further Board approval. Virginia Power believes that its operations provide a stable source of
cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and provide dividends to Dominion.

The Companies’
operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows, and which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Dominion’s exposure to potential
concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion’s credit exposure as of December 31, 2011 for these activities. Gross credit
exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.

(1)

Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. The five largest counterparty
exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 33% of the total net credit exposure.

(2)

The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 1% of the total net credit exposure.

(3)

The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 8% of the total net credit exposure.

(4)

The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 12% of the total net credit exposure.

Virginia Power’s exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from sales to wholesale customers and was not
considered material at December 31, 2011.

Investing Cash Flows

In 2011, net cash used in Dominion’s investing activities was $3.3 billion as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $419 million in 2010, primarily reflecting the absence of the
proceeds received in 2010 from the sale of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations and the sale of Peoples.

In 2011,
net cash used in Virginia Power’s investing activities decreased by $478 million, primarily due to lower capital expenditures and restricted funds spent in 2011 as compared to restricted funds deposited in 2010 for the purpose of funding
certain qualifying construction projects.

Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity

Dominion and Virginia Power rely on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by their operations. As discussed in

Credit Ratings

,
the Companies’ ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration
with the SEC for certain issuances and, in the case of Virginia Power, approval by the Virginia Commission.

Each of the
Companies currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration
process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows the Companies to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for business combination transactions.

In 2011, net cash provided by Dominion’s financing activities was $378 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities
of $2.2 billion in 2010, primarily due to net debt issuances in 2011 as compared to net debt repayments in 2010, reflecting, in part, the use of proceeds in 2010 from the sales of Dominion’s Appalachian E&P operations and Peoples to repay
debt.

In 2011, net cash used in Virginia Power’s financing activities was $53 million as compared to net cash provided by
financing activities of $1.0 billion in 2010, primarily reflecting lower net debt issuances in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of higher cash flow from operations.

Dominion and Virginia Power use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the
year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity
prices, hedging levels, Dominion’s credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.

In connection with
commodity hedging activities, the Companies are required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, the Companies may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post
letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, the Companies vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different
forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which the Companies can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative
collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives.

Virginia Power did not issue senior notes during 2011.

In December 2010, Brayton Point borrowed approximately $160 million and approximately $75 million in connection with the Massachusetts
Development Finance Agency Recovery Zone Facility Bonds, Series 2010 A and the Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 B, respectively, which mature in 2041. The proceeds are being used to finance certain qualifying facilities at Brayton
Point. Due to unfavorable market conditions, Dominion acquired the bonds upon issuance in December 2010 with the intention of remarketing them to third parties at a later time. At December 31, 2010, these bonds had not been remarketed and thus
were not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In July 2011, the Series 2010 B bonds were remarketed to a third party using a remarketing process, and bear interest at a variable rate for the first five years, after which they will bear
interest at a market rate to be determined at that time. In August 2011, the Series 2010 A bonds were remarketed to third parties using a remarketing process, and bear interest at a coupon rate of 2.25% for the first five years, after which they
will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time.

In December 2010 and September 2009, Virginia Power
borrowed $100 million and $60 million, respectively, in connection with the $160 million Industrial Development Authority of Wise County Solid Waste and Sewage Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2009 A, which mature in 2040. The proceeds are being used

Virginia Power has the ability to borrow funds from Dominion under both short-term and long-term
borrowing arrangements and at December 31, 2011, its nonregulated subsidiaries had outstanding borrowings, net of repayments, under the Dominion money pool of $187 million.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a
framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion and Virginia Power believe that their current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However,
disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion and Virginia Power may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion’s and Virginia
Power’s credit ratings may affect their liquidity, cost of borrowing

under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which they are able to offer their debt securities.

Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating
agencies in establishing an individual company’s credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion and
Virginia Power are affected by each company’s financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major
acquisitions or dispositions.

Credit ratings as of February 23, 2012 follow:

As of February 23, 2012, Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s maintained a stable
outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion and Virginia Power.

A downgrade in an individual company’s credit rating
would not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it would likely increase the cost of borrowing. Dominion and Virginia Power work closely with Fitch,
Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s with the objective of maintaining their current credit ratings. The Companies may find it necessary to modify their business plans to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes
may adversely affect growth and EPS.

Debt Covenants

As part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion and Virginia Power must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants
that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments;
and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are
not necessarily unique to Dominion and Virginia Power.

Some of the typical covenants include:

Ÿ

The timely payment of principal and interest;

Ÿ

Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC and information about changes in Dominion’s and Virginia
Power’s credit ratings to lenders;

Ÿ

Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

related to merger or consolidation, and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets;

Ÿ

Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and

Ÿ

Limitations on liens.

Dominion and Virginia Power are required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain their credit facilities. In addition, their credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect
their ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions.

As of December 31, 2011, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as
follows:

Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes junior subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

These provisions apply separately to Dominion and Virginia Power. If Dominion or Virginia
Power or any of either company’s material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require that company to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the
credit facility and the lenders could terminate their commitment to lend funds to that company. Accordingly, any default by Dominion will not affect the lenders’ commitment to Virginia Power. However, any default by Virginia Power would affect
the lenders’ commitment to Dominion under the joint credit agreements.

Dominion executed RCCs in connection with its
issuance of the following hybrid securities:

Dividend Restrictions

The Virginia Commission may
prohibit any public service company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a
divi-

dend to an affiliate if found to be detrimental to the public interest. At December 31, 2011, the Virginia Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by Virginia Power.

Certain agreements associated with Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s credit facilities contain restrictions on the
ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion or Virginia Power’s ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from their subsidiaries at December 31, 2011.

Dominion and Virginia Power expect to fund their capital
expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the respective company’s Board of
Directors.

the business scope exception as of October 2011, which required that Dominion determine whether Juniper is a VIE. Dominion concluded Juniper is a VIE because the entity’s capitalization is insufficient to support its operations, the power to
direct the most significant activities of the entity are not performed by the equity holders, and Dominion, through its residual value guarantee discussed above, guarantees a portion of the residual value of Fairless. The activities that most
significantly impact Juniper’s economic performance relate to the operation of Fairless. The decisions related to the operations of Fairless are made by Dominion and as such, Dominion is considered the primary beneficiary.

As the primary beneficiary, Dominion began consolidating Juniper in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result, this leasing arrangement is
no longer considered an off-balance sheet arrangement.

See Item 1. Business, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Notes 14 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other
matters that may impact future results of operations and/or financial condition.

Environmental Matters

Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health
and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.

EGULATIONS

Air

The CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to
protect and preserve the nation’s air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many
of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s facilities are subject to the CAA’s permitting and other requirements.

The EPA has finalized rules establishing a new 1-hour NAAQS for NO


and a new 1-hour NAAQS for SO


, which could require additional NO

X

and SO


controls in certain areas where the Companies operate. Until the states have developed implementation plans for these standards, the impact on Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s facilities that emit NO

X

and SO


is uncertain.

In January 2010, the EPA also proposed a new, more stringent NAAQS for ozone and had planned to finalize the rule in 2011. In September 2011, the EPA announced a delay from 2011 to 2014 of the rulemaking,
therefore NO

x

controls that may have

been required by the rulemaking are also expected to be delayed. However, the EPA’s decision to delay the rulemaking has been challenged in federal court and the length of delay in possible
NO

x

controls, if any, will depend on the outcome of that
litigation. In the interim, the EPA is proceeding with implementation of the current ozone standard and is expected to make final attainment/nonattainment designations by June 2012. Until the litigation is final and the states have developed
implementation plans for the new NO

X

, SO


and ozone standards, it is not possible to determine the impact on
Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s facilities that emit NO

X

and
SO


. The Companies cannot currently predict with
certainty whether or to what extent the new rules will ultimately require additional controls, however, if significant expenditures are required, it could adversely affect Dominion’s results of operations, and Dominion’s and Virginia
Power’s cash flows.

In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to the Regional Haze Rule, also known as the Clean Air
Visibility Rule. The rule requires the states to implement Best Available Retrofit Technology requirements for sources to address impacts to visual air quality through regional haze state implementation plans, but allows other alternative options.
The EPA has recently announced a schedule to complete rulemakings on regional haze state implementation plans during 2012. Although Dominion and Virginia Power anticipate that the emission reductions achieved through compliance with other CAA
required programs will generally address this rule, additional emission reduction requirements may be imposed on the Companies’ facilities.

Water

The CWA is a comprehensive program
requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. Dominion and Virginia Power must comply with all aspects of the CWA programs at their
operating facilities. In July 2004, the EPA published regulations under CWA Section 316(b) that govern existing utilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold. In April 2008, the
U.S. Supreme Court granted an industry request to review the question of whether Section 316(b) authorizes the EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology available for minimizing “adverse environmental
impact” at cooling water intake structures. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in April 2009 that the EPA has the authority to consider costs versus environmental benefits in selecting the best technology available for reducing impacts of cooling
water intakes at power stations. It is currently unknown how the EPA will interpret the ruling in its ongoing rulemaking activity addressing cooling water intakes as well as how the states will implement this decision. In April 2011, the EPA
published the proposed rule related to Section 316(b) in the Federal Register, and agreed to publish a final rule no later than July 27, 2012.

The rule in its proposed form seeks to establish a uniform national standard for impingement, but forgoes the creation of a single technology standard for entrainment. Instead, the EPA proposes to
delegate entrainment technology decisions to state regulators. State regulators are to make case-by-case entrainment technology determinations after an examination of nine facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test.



The proposed rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above two
MGD, with a heightened entrainment analysis for those facilities over 125 MGD. Under this proposal, Dominion has 18 facilities that may be subject to these proposed regulations. If finalized as proposed, Dominion anticipates that it will have to
install impingement control technologies at many of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot estimate the need or potential for entrainment controls under the proposed rule as these decisions will be
made on a case-by-case basis after a thorough review of detailed biological, technology, cost and benefit studies. However, the impacts of this proposed rule may be material to results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Solid and Hazardous Waste

In
June 2010, the EPA proposed federal regulations under the RCRA for management of coal combustion by-products generated by power plants. The EPA is considering two possible options for the regulation of coal combustion by-products, both of which fall
under the RCRA. Under the first proposal, the EPA would classify these by-products as special wastes subject to regulation under subtitle C, the hazardous waste provisions of the RCRA, when destined for disposal at landfills or surface impoundments.
Under the second proposal, the EPA would regulate coal combustion by-products under subtitle D of the RCRA, the section for non-hazardous wastes. While the Companies cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter, regulation under either option
will affect Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s onsite disposal facilities and coal combustion by-product management practices, and potentially require material investments.

Climate Change Legislation and Regulation

In December 2009, the EPA issued their

Final
Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act

, finding that GHGs “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” On
April 1, 2010, the EPA and the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Safety Administration announced a joint final rule establishing a program that will dramatically reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy for new cars and
trucks sold in the United States. These rules took effect in January 2011 and established GHG emissions as regulated pollutants under the CAA.

In May 2010, the EPA issued the

Final Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule

that, combined with prior actions, require Dominion and Virginia Power to
obtain permits for GHG emissions for new and modified facilities over certain size thresholds, and meet best available control technology for GHG emissions. The EPA has issued draft guidance for GHG permitting, including best available control
technology. The EPA has also announced a schedule for proposing standards to regulate GHG emissions under the NSPS that would apply to new, modified and existing fossil-fired electric generating units. In August 2011, the EPA announced a delay in
the schedule for proposing these regulations. Regulations were expected to be proposed by July 2011 and finalized by May 2012. The schedule for a proposed rulemaking governing a GHG

NSPS for existing sources is now delayed beyond January 2012, while a proposed NSPS governing new and modified units is expected to be released in early 2012.

There are other legislative proposals that may be considered that would have an indirect impact on GHG emissions. There is the potential
for the U.S. Congress to consider a mandatory Clean Energy Standard. In addition to possible federal action, some regions and states in which Dominion and Virginia Power operate have already adopted or may adopt GHG emission reduction programs. Any
of these new or contemplated regulations may affect capital costs, or create significant permitting delays, for new or modified facilities that emit GHGs.

In July 2008, Massachusetts passed the GWSA. Among other provisions, the GWSA sets economy-wide GHG emissions reduction goals for Massachusetts, including reductions of 25% below 1990 levels by 2020,
interim goals for 2030 and 2040 and reductions of 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. No regulations impacting Dominion under the GWSA have been proposed. Dominion operates two coal/oil-fired generating power stations in Massachusetts and acts as a
retail electric supplier in Massachusetts, all of which are subject to the implementation of the GWSA.

In December 2009, the
governors of 11 Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, including Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island (RGGI states plus Pennsylvania) signed a memorandum of understanding committing their states toward
developing a low carbon fuel standard to reduce GHG emissions from vehicles. The memorandum of understanding established a process to develop a regional framework by 2011 and examine the economic impacts of a low carbon fuel standard program.
Although economic studies and policy options were examined in 2011, a definitive framework has yet to be established.

Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that
will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to
as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange trading requirements. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows applicable regulators, including the CFTC and SEC, to impose initial and variation margin
requirements on entities who execute swaps. End users were not expressly exempted from these requirements for non-cleared swaps and rules have been proposed that address the margin obligations to be imposed on non-cleared swaps entered with end
users. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the clearing, exchange trading and margin requirements, will be established through the ongoing rulemaking process of the applicable
regulators. In June 2011, both the CFTC and the SEC confirmed that they would not complete the required rulemakings by the July 2011 deadline under the Dodd-Frank Act. Each agency has granted temporary relief from most derivative-related provisions
of the Dodd-Frank Act until the effective date of the applicable rules. Currently, the CFTC’s temporary relief



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued

would expire no later than July 16, 2012, if not extended. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s derivative activities are not exempted from the
clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. In addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the over-the-counter
derivative provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies’ swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies’ derivative activities. Due to the ongoing rulemaking process, the Companies are currently unable to
assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act’s derivative-related provisions on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Nuclear Matters

In March 2011, a magnitude 9.0
earthquake and subsequent tsunami caused significant damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in northeast Japan. These events have resulted in significant nuclear safety reviews required by the NRC and industry groups such as INPO.
Like other U.S. nuclear operators, Dominion has been gathering supporting data and participating in industry initiatives focused on the ability to respond to and mitigate the consequences of design-basis and beyond-design-basis events at its
stations. In July 2011, an NRC Task Force provided initial recommendations based on its review of the Fukushima Daiichi accident; and in October 2011, the NRC Staff provided its views on the prioritization of these recommendations and suggested
several additional measures. In December 2011, the NRC Commissioners approved the agency staff’s prioritization and recommendations; and that same month an Appropriations Act directed the NRC to require reevaluation of external hazards
(not limited to seismic and flooding hazards) as expeditiously as possible. The NRC anticipates issuance of orders and information requests requiring specific reviews and actions by the first anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2012.
These actions, if adopted, could require nuclear plant modifications and may impact future operations and/or capital requirements at U.S. nuclear facilities, including those owned by Dominion and Virginia Power.

In August 2011, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake near Mineral, Virginia caused the two reactors at North Anna to shut down immediately, as
designed. Some of the earthquake’s vibrations briefly exceeded North Anna’s licensing design basis at certain frequencies, however, Virginia Power’s inspections have shown no significant damage to equipment at the station from the
earthquake. The reactors were placed in cold shutdown condition pending completion of NRC inspection and review. North Anna returned to full service in November 2011, following receipt of NRC approval to restart the two reactors.

Cove Point Export and Re-Export Projects

In
September 2011, Cove Point filed the first part of a two-part domestic export authorization request with the DOE. The DOE approved the request in October 2011. The approval allows for long-term, multi-contract authority to liquefy for export
domestically-produced LNG from the Cove Point terminal up to the equivalent of approximately 1 bcf of natural gas per day over a twenty-five year period. The approval also allows for Cove Point to act as an agent for third parties to liquefy for
export domestically-produced LNG to other countries that (i) have a free

trade agreement with the U.S. that includes natural gas, and (ii) possess the capacity to import LNG via ocean-going carriers.

Cove Point filed the second part of the domestic export authorization application in October 2011. In the application, Cove Point
requested authority to export domestically-produced LNG to other countries (i) with which the U.S. does not prohibit free trade, but does not have a free trade agreement that includes natural gas, and (ii) that possess the capacity to
import LNG via ocean-going carriers.

Cove Point is not yet committed to operating an LNG export facility. Cove Point intends
to secure customer commitments before deciding whether to proceed, and regulatory approvals will also be required. Subject to a final decision on pursuing the project, as well as securing applicable regulatory and other approvals, construction of
liquefaction facilities to convert natural gas into LNG could begin in 2014.

In addition to the domestic export project, in
August 2011, Cove Point filed an application with the DOE seeking blanket authority to re-export foreign-sourced LNG from the Cove Point terminal. In January 2012, the DOE approved the request to re-export up to the equivalent of 150 bcf of natural
gas over a two-year period. The approval allows Cove Point to act as an agent for third parties to re-export LNG to other countries (i) other than those with which the U.S. prohibits free trade, and (ii) that possess the capacity to import
LNG via ocean-going carriers. Cove Point must also obtain FERC approval prior to undertaking the minimal construction required for re-export.

Brayton
Point and Salem Harbor CAA Section 114 Request

In May 2010, Dominion received a request for information pursuant to Section 114 of the CAA
from the EPA. The request concerns historical operating changes and capital improvements undertaken at Brayton Point and Salem Harbor. Dominion submitted its response to the request in November 2010 and cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

Pipeline Safety Act

In January 2012,
the Pipeline Safety Act was signed into law. The Pipeline Safety Act is intended to address pipeline safety issues that received national attention following a series of significant incidents involving pipelines. The Act provides the U.S. DOT
with enhanced safety review authority and requires pipeline owners and operators to confirm, through records or testing, the maximum allowable operating pressure of certain gas pipelines in populated or certain high consequence areas. Operators that
fail to confirm the maximum allowable operating pressure for the



identified locations within six months of enactment must conduct new testing. The Pipeline Safety Act also requires the U.S. DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to
consider certain factors and, if appropriate, to issue regulations requiring automatic shut-off valves on new or replaced pipelines where economically, technically and operationally feasible and to establish time limits for accident and incident
notification. In addition, the Act doubles the maximum civil penalty for violations of the U.S. DOT’s compliance and safety rules from $100,000 to $200,000 for an individual violation and from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 for a series of
violations. While Dominion cannot estimate the potential financial statement impacts of the Pipeline Safety Act, additional operations and maintenance expenses and/or capital expenditures required to comply with the new rules are not expected to be
material.

ANAGEMENT

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s financial instruments, commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to potential
losses due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity security prices as described below. Commodity price risk is present in Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s electric operations, Dominion’s gas procurement
operations, and Dominion’s energy marketing and trading operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for electricity, natural gas and other commodities. The Companies use commodity derivative contracts to manage
price risk exposures for these operations. Interest rate risk is generally related to their outstanding debt. In addition, they are exposed to investment price risk through various portfolios of equity and debt securities.

The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments
over a selected time period due to a 10% unfavorable change in commodity prices or interest rates.

Commodity Price Risk

To manage price risk, Dominion and Virginia Power primarily hold commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated
with purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products. As part of its strategy to market energy and to manage related risks, Dominion also holds commodity-based financial derivative instruments for trading purposes.

The derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are executed within established policies and procedures and may

include instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, options and FTRs that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the hypothetical change in
market prices of commodity-based financial derivative instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors
of the derivative instruments. Prices and volatility are principally determined based on observable market prices.

A
hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in commodity prices of Dominion’s non-trading commodity-based financial derivative instruments would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of approximately $179 million and $183 million as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in commodity prices of Dominion’s commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for trading purposes would have resulted in a decrease in fair
value of approximately $8 million and $5 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

A hypothetical 10%
unfavorable change in commodity prices would not have resulted in a material change in the fair value of Virginia Power’s non-trading commodity-based financial derivatives as of December 31, 2011 or 2010.

The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s non-trading commodity-based financial
derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from commodity derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent
realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction, such as revenue from physical sales of the commodity.

Interest Rate Risk

Dominion and Virginia Power manage their interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate
debt. They also enter into interest rate sensitive derivatives, including interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. For financial instruments designated under fair value hedging and outstanding for Dominion and Virginia Power, a
hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would not have resulted in a material change in annual earnings as of December 31, 2011 or 2010.

Dominion and Virginia Power may also use forward-starting interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements as anticipatory hedges. At December 31, 2010, Dominion and Virginia Power had no such
interest rate derivatives outstanding; therefore, Dominion and Virginia Power had no sensitivity to changes in interest rates related to these interest rate derivatives. At December 31, 2011, Dominion and Virginia Power had $2.3 billion and
$1.3 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $31 million and $15 million,
respectively, in the fair value of these interest rate derivatives held by Dominion and Virginia Power at December 31, 2011.

The impact of a change in market interest rates on these anticipatory hedges at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when such contracts are settled. Net
gains and/or losses from interest rate derivatives used for



anticipatory hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be amortized over the life of the respective debt issuance being hedged.

Investment Price Risk

Dominion and Virginia Power
are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in decommissioning and rabbi trust funds that are managed by third-party investment managers. These trust funds primarily hold marketable securities that are reported in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

Dominion recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear
decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $54 million and $95 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair
value. In 2011 and 2010, Dominion recorded, in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on these investments of $52 million and $182 million, respectively.

Virginia Power recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust investments of $24 million and
$44 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. In 2011 and 2010, Virginia Power recorded, in AOCI and
regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on these investments of $25 million and $67 million, respectively.

Dominion sponsors pension and other postretirement benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments.
Virginia Power employees participate in these plans. Aggregate actual returns for Dominion’s pension and other
post-

retirement plan assets were $273 million in 2011 and $624 million in 2010, versus expected returns of $519 million and $479 million, respectively. Differences between actual and expected returns
on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the periodic cost recognized for employee benefit plans and will be included in the
determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, a hypothetical 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rates of return on Dominion’s plan assets would result in an
increase in net periodic cost of approximately $13 million for pension benefits and $3 million for other postretirement benefits.

Risk Management
Policies

Dominion and Virginia Power have established operating procedures with corporate management to ensure that proper internal
controls are maintained. In addition, Dominion has established an independent function at the corporate level to monitor compliance with the credit and commodity risk management policies of all subsidiaries, including Virginia Power. Dominion
maintains credit policies that include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty’s financial condition, collateral requirements where deemed necessary and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows
associated with a single counterparty. In addition, Dominion also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis. Based on these credit policies and Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s
December 31, 2011 provision for credit losses, management believes that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a
result of counterparty nonperformance.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are

PERATIONS

Dominion, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is one of the nation’s largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominion’s operations are
conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power, a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and North Carolina. Virginia Power is a member of PJM, an RTO, and its electric
transmission facilities are integrated into the PJM wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Power’s common stock is owned by Dominion. Dominion’s operations also include a regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and
underground storage system in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, an LNG import and storage facility in Maryland and regulated gas transportation and distribution operations in Ohio and West Virginia. Dominion’s nonregulated
operations include merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities and retail energy marketing operations.

Dominion manages its daily operations through three primary operating segments: DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy. Dominion also reports a Corporate and Other segment, which includes its
corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt) and the net impact of the operations and sale of Peoples, which is discussed in Note 4. In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to
Dominion’s operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’ performance or allocating resources among the segments.

Virginia Power manages its daily operations through two primary operating segments: DVP and Dominion Generation. It also reports a
Corporate and Other segment that primarily includes specific items attributable to its operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments’ performance or allocating resources
among the segments. See Note 26 for further discussion of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s operating segments.

OLICIES

General

Dominion and Virginia Power make certain estimates and assumptions in preparing their Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany
transactions and balances, the accounts of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries and those VIEs where Dominion has been determined to be the primary beneficiary.

Dominion and Virginia Power report certain contracts, instruments and investments at fair value. See Note 7 for further information on fair value measurements.

Dominion maintains pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Virginia Power
participates in certain of these plans. See Note 22 for further information on these plans.

Certain amounts in the 2010 and
2009 Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect the Companies’ net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash
flows.

Amounts disclosed for Dominion are inclusive of Virginia Power, where applicable.

Operating Revenue

Operating revenue is recorded on
the basis of services rendered, commodities delivered or contracts settled and includes amounts yet to be billed to customers. The Companies collect sales, consumption and consumer utility taxes; however, these amounts are excluded from revenue.
Dominion’s customer receivables at December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $423 million and $466 million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity and natural gas delivered but not yet billed to
its utility customers. Virginia Power’s customer receivables at December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $360 million and $397 million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity delivered but not
yet billed to its customers.

The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Dominion are
as follows:

Ÿ

Regulated electric sales

consist
primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales, and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services;

Ÿ

Nonregulated electric sales

consist
primarily of sales of electricity at market-based rates and contracted fixed rates, and associated derivative activity;

Ÿ

Regulated gas sales

consist primarily
of state-regulated retail natural gas sales and related distribution services;

Ÿ

Nonregulated gas sales

consist
primarily of sales of natural gas production at market-based rates and contracted fixed prices, sales of gas purchased from third parties, gas trading and marketing revenue and associated derivative activity. Revenue from sales of gas production is
recognized based on actual volumes of gas sold to purchasers and is reported net of royalties;

Ÿ

Gas transportation and storage

consists primarily of regulated sales of gathering, transmission, distribution and storage services and associated derivative activity. Also included are regulated gas distribution charges to retail distribution service customers opting for
alternate suppliers; and

Ÿ

Other revenue

consists primarily of
sales of oil and NGL production and condensate, extracted products and associated derivative activity. Other revenue also includes miscellaneous service revenue from electric and gas distribution operations, and gas processing and handling revenue.

The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Virginia Power are as
follows:

Ÿ

Regulated electric sales

consist
primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services; and

Ÿ

Other revenue

consists primarily of
miscellaneous service revenue from electric distribution operations and miscellaneous



revenue from generation operations, including sales of capacity and other commodities.

Electric Fuel, Purchased Energy and Purchased Gas-Deferred Costs

Where permitted by regulatory
authorities, the differences between Virginia Power’s actual electric fuel and purchased energy expenses and Dominion’s purchased gas expenses and the related levels of recovery for these expenses in current rates are deferred and matched
against recoveries in future periods. The deferral of costs in excess of current period fuel rate recovery is recognized as a regulatory asset, while rate recovery in excess of current period fuel expenses is recognized as a regulatory liability.

Of the cost of fuel used in electric generation and energy purchases to serve utility customers, approximately 84% is
currently subject to deferred fuel accounting, while substantially all of the remaining amount is subject to recovery through similar mechanisms.

Income Taxes

A consolidated federal income tax
return is filed for Dominion and its subsidiaries, including Virginia Power. In addition, where applicable, combined income tax returns for Dominion and its subsidiaries are filed in various states; otherwise, separate state income tax returns are
filed. Virginia Power participates in an intercompany tax sharing agreement with Dominion and its subsidiaries, and its current income taxes are based on its taxable income or loss, determined on a separate company basis.

Accounting for income taxes involves an asset and liability approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided,
representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion and Virginia Power establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not
that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Where the treatment of temporary differences is different for rate-regulated operations, a regulatory asset is recognized if it is probable that future revenues will be provided
for the payment of deferred tax liabilities.

Dominion and Virginia Power recognize positions taken, or expected to be taken,
in income tax returns that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.

If it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax position, or some portion thereof, will be sustained, the related tax benefits are not
recognized in the financial statements. Unrecognized tax benefits may result in an increase in income taxes payable, a reduction of income tax refunds receivable or changes in deferred taxes. Also, when uncertainty about the deductibility of an
amount is limited to the timing of such deductibility, the increase in income taxes payable (or reduction in tax refunds receivable) is accompanied by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities. Noncurrent income taxes payable related to unrecognized
tax benefits are classified in other deferred credits and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and current payables are included in accrued interest, payroll and taxes on the consolidated balance sheets, except when such amounts are
presented net with amounts receivable from or amounts prepaid to tax authorities.

Dominion and Virginia Power recognize changes in estimated interest payable on net
underpayments of income taxes in interest expense. Changes in interest receivable related to net overpayments of income taxes and estimated penalties that may result from the settlement of some uncertain tax positions are recognized in other income.
In its Consolidated Statements of Income for 2011, Dominion recognized interest income of $12 million and interest expense of $7 million and a reduction in penalties of less than $1 million. In 2010, Dominion recognized a reduction in interest
expense of $18 million and a reduction in penalties of less than $1 million; in 2009, Dominion recognized a reduction in interest expense of $19 million and a reduction in penalties of $2 million. Dominion had accrued interest receivable of $48
million, interest payable of $10 million and penalties payable of less than $1 million at December 31, 2011 and interest receivable of $27 million and interest and penalties payable of less than $1 million at December 31, 2010.

In 2011, Virginia Power recognized interest income of $12 million, and penalties were immaterial. Virginia Power had accrued
interest receivable of $17 million at December 31, 2011. Virginia Power’s interest and penalties were immaterial in 2010 and 2009.

At December 31, 2011, Virginia Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $18 million of current federal income taxes receivable, $34 million of current state income taxes payable and $110
million of noncurrent federal and state income taxes payable. At December 31, 2010, Virginia Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $46 million of prepaid federal and state income taxes and $102 million of noncurrent federal and
state income taxes payable.

Investment tax credits are recognized by nonregulated operations in the year qualifying property
is placed in service. For regulated operations, investment tax credits are deferred and amortized over the service lives of the properties giving rise to the credits. Production tax credits are recognized as energy is generated and sold.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Current banking
arrangements generally do not require checks to be funded until they are presented for payment. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Dominion’s accounts payable included $75 million and $56 million, respectively, of checks outstanding but not
yet presented for payment. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Virginia Power’s accounts payable included $40 million and $28 million, respectively, of checks outstanding but not yet presented for payment. For purposes of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and temporary investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.

Derivative Instruments

Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative instruments such as futures,
swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage the commodity, currency exchange and financial market risks of their business operations.

All derivatives, other than those for which an exception applies, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivative contracts representing unrealized gain positions and purchased
options are reported as derivative assets. Derivative contracts representing unrealized losses and options sold are



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

reported as derivative liabilities. One of the exceptions to fair value accounting, normal purchases and normal sales, may be elected when the contract satisfies certain criteria, including a
requirement that physical delivery of the underlying commodity is probable. Expenses and revenues resulting from deliveries under normal purchase contracts and normal sales contracts, respectively, are included in earnings at the time of contract
performance.

Dominion and Virginia Power do not offset amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the
obligation to return cash collateral against amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. Dominion had margin assets of $319 million and $244 million associated with
cash collateral at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Dominion had margin liabilities of $66 million and $62 million associated with cash collateral at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Virginia Power had margin assets of
$41 million associated with cash collateral at December 31, 2011. Virginia Power’s margin assets associated with cash collateral were not material at December 31, 2010. Virginia Power’s margin liabilities associated with cash
collateral were not material at December 31, 2011 and 2010.

To manage price risk, Dominion and Virginia Power hold
certain derivative instruments that are not held for trading purposes and are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. However, to the extent the Companies do not hold offsetting positions for such derivatives, they believe these
instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate their exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. As part of Dominion’s strategy to market energy and manage related risks, it also manages a
portfolio of commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for trading purposes. Dominion uses established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with price fluctuations in these energy commodities and uses various derivative
instruments to reduce risk by creating offsetting market positions.

Statement of Income Presentation:

Derivatives Held for Trading Purposes:

All income statement activity, including amounts realized upon settlement, is presented in operating revenue on a net basis.

Ÿ

Derivatives Not Held for Trading Purposes:

All income statement activity, including amounts realized upon settlement, is presented in operating revenue, operating expenses or interest and related charges based on the nature of the underlying
risk.

In Virginia Power’s generation operations, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments
result in the recognition of regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities for jurisdictions subject to cost-based rate regulation. Realized gains or losses on the derivative instruments are generally recognized when the related transactions impact
earnings.

EDGING

I

NSTRUMENTS

Dominion and Virginia Power designate a portion of their derivative instruments as either cash flow or fair
value hedges for accounting purposes. For all derivatives designated as hedges, Dominion and Virginia Power formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and the
strategy for using

the hedging instrument. The Companies assess whether the hedging relationship between the derivative and the hedged item is highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values
both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Any change in the fair value of the derivative that is not effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged item is recognized currently in
earnings. Also, the Companies may elect to exclude certain gains or losses on hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as gains or losses attributable to changes in the time value of options or changes in the difference
between spot prices and forward prices, thus requiring that such changes be recorded currently in earnings. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively for derivatives that cease to be highly effective hedges.

Cash Flow Hedges

—A majority of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s hedge strategies represents cash flow hedges of the
variable price risk associated with the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products. The Companies also use foreign currency contracts to hedge the variability in foreign exchange rates and interest rate swaps to
hedge their exposure to variable interest rates on long-term debt. For transactions in which Dominion and Virginia Power are hedging the variability of cash flows, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in AOCI, to the extent they
are effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item. Any derivative gains or losses reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the forecasted item is included in earnings, or earlier, if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction
will not occur. For cash flow hedge transactions, hedge accounting is discontinued if the occurrence of the forecasted transaction is no longer probable.

Fair Value Hedges

—Dominion also uses fair value hedges to mitigate the fixed price exposure inherent in certain firm commodity commitments and commodity inventory. In addition, Dominion and
Virginia Power have designated interest rate swaps as fair value hedges on certain fixed-rate long-term debt to manage interest rate exposure. For fair value hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative are generally offset
currently in earnings by the recognition of changes in the hedged item’s fair value. Derivative gains and losses from the hedged item are reclassified to earnings when the hedged item is included in earnings, or earlier, if the hedged item no
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Hedge accounting is discontinued if the hedged item no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

See Note 7 for further information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives. See Note 8 for further information on derivatives.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment, including additions and replacements is recorded at original cost, consisting of labor and materials and other direct and indirect costs such as asset retirement costs, capitalized interest and, for certain operations subject to
cost-of-service rate regulation, AFUDC and overhead costs. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including minor additions and replacements, is charged to expense as it is incurred.

In 2011, 2010 and 2009, Dominion capitalized interest costs and AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $85 million, $102 million and
$76 million, respectively. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, Virginia Power capitalized AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $31 million, $61 million and $47 million,



respectively. Under Virginia law, certain Virginia jurisdictional projects qualify for current recovery of AFUDC through rate adjustment clauses. AFUDC on these projects is calculated and
recorded as a regulatory asset and is not capitalized to property, plant and equipment. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, Virginia Power recorded $20 million, $13 million and $34 million of AFUDC related to these projects, respectively.

For Virginia Power property subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, including electric distribution, electric transmission, and
generation property and for certain Dominion natural gas property, the undepreciated cost of such property, less salvage value, is generally charged to accumulated depreciation at retirement, with gains and losses recorded on the sales of property.
Cost of removal collections from utility customers not representing AROs are recorded as regulatory liabilities. For property subject to cost-of-service rate regulation that will be retired or abandoned significantly before the end of their useful
lives, the net carrying value is reclassified from plant-in-service when it becomes probable they will be retired or abandoned.

For Dominion and Virginia Power property that is not subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, including nonutility property, cost of
removal not associated with AROs is charged to expense as incurred. The Companies also record gains and losses upon retirement based upon the difference between the proceeds received, if any, and the property’s net book value at the retirement
date.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line method based on projected service lives.
Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s depreciation rates on utility property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Dominion’s nonutility property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method
over the following estimated useful lives:

Asset

Estimated Useful Lives

Merchant generation—nuclear

29–44 years

Merchant generation—other

27–40 years

General and other

3–25 years

Nuclear fuel used in electric generation is amortized over its estimated service life on a
units-of-production basis. Dominion and Virginia Power report the amortization of nuclear fuel in electric fuel and other energy-related purchases expense in their Consolidated Statements of Income and in depreciation and amortization in their
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Dominion follows the full cost method of accounting for its gas and oil E&P
activities, which subjects capitalized costs to a quarterly ceiling test using hedge-adjusted prices. Due to the April

2010 sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations Dominion no longer has any significant gas and oil properties subject to the ceiling test calculation.

In 2010, Dominion recorded a ceiling test impairment charge of $21 million ($13 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance
expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to a decline in hedge-adjusted prices reflecting the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain cash flow hedges, as discussed in Note 4.

In 2009, Dominion recorded a ceiling test impairment charge of $455 million ($281 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance
expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income. Excluding the effects of hedge-adjusted prices in calculating the ceiling limitation, the impairment would have been $631 million ($387 million after-tax).

In 2010, Dominion recognized a gain from the sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations as discussed in Note 4.

Emissions Allowances

Emissions allowances permit the holder of the allowance to emit certain gaseous by-products of fossil fuel combustion, including
SO


, NO

X

and CO


. SO


and NO

X

emissions allowances are issued to Dominion and Virginia Power by the EPA and may also be purchased and sold via third
party contracts. CO


emissions allowances are available for
purchase by Dominion through quarterly auctions held by participating RGGI states. Compliance with the RGGI requirements only applies to certain of Dominion’s merchant power stations located in the Northeast.

Allowances held may be transacted with third parties or consumed as these emissions are generated. Allowances allocated to or acquired by
the Companies’ generation operations are held primarily for consumption.

Allowances held for
consumption are classified as intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Carrying amounts are based on the cost to acquire the allowances or, in the case of a business combination, on the fair values assigned to them in the allocation of
the purchase price of the acquired business. A portion of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s SO


and NO

X

allowances are issued by the EPA at zero cost.

These allowances are amortized in the periods the emissions are generated, with
the amortization reflected in DD&A in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Purchases and sales of these allowances are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and gains or losses resulting from sales are
reported in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for discussion of impairments related to emissions allowances.

Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

Dominion and Virginia Power perform an evaluation for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets or intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. A long-lived or intangible asset is written down to fair value if the sum of its
expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying amount. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 7 for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and
intangible assets with finite lives.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The accounting for Dominion’s regulated gas and Virginia Power’s regulated electric operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that they are required to reflect the
effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting
methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are
deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be
incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.

The Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future rates is probable and make various assumptions in
their analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of a regulatory asset is
determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Dominion and Virginia Power recognize AROs at fair value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate
of the fair value of future retirement activities to be performed. These amounts are generally capitalized as costs of the related tangible long-lived assets. Since relevant market information is not available, fair value is estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses. Dominion reports accretion of AROs associated with its natural gas pipeline and storage well assets as an adjustment to the related regulatory liabilities when revenue is recoverable from customers for AROs. Virginia
Power reports accretion of AROs associated with decommissioning its nuclear power stations as an adjustment to the regulatory liability for certain jurisdictions. Accretion of all other AROs is reported in other operations and maintenance expense in
the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs

Dominion and Virginia Power defer and amortize debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts over the expected lives of the respective debt issues, considering maturity dates and, if applicable,
redemption rights held by others. As permitted by regulatory authorities, gains or losses resulting from the refinancing of debt allocable to utility operations subject to cost-based rate regulation have also been deferred and are amortized over the
lives of the new issuances.

If a decline in fair value of any security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to its fair value at the end of the reporting period.



Decommissioning Trust Investments—Special Considerations

Ÿ

The FASB amended its guidance for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, which Dominion and Virginia Power adopted
effective April 1, 2009. The recognition provisions of this guidance apply only to debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, while the presentation and disclosure requirements apply to both debt and equity
securities. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, Dominion and Virginia Power considered all debt securities held by their nuclear decommissioning trusts with market values below their cost bases to be other-than-temporarily impaired as they did
not have the ability to ensure the investments were held through the anticipated recovery period.

Ÿ

Debt Securities

—Effective with the adoption of this guidance, using information obtained from their nuclear decommissioning trust
fixed-income investment managers, Dominion and Virginia Power record in earnings any unrealized loss for a debt security when the manager intends to sell the debt security or it is more-likely-than-not that the manager will have to sell the debt
security before recovery of its fair value up to its cost basis. If that is the case, but the debt security is deemed to have experienced a credit loss, the Companies record the credit loss in earnings and any remaining portion of the unrealized
loss in other comprehensive income. Credit losses are evaluated primarily by considering the credit ratings of the issuer, prior instances of non-performance by the issuer and other factors.

Ÿ

Equity securities and other investments

—Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s method of assessing other-than-temporary declines
requires demonstrating the ability to hold individual securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in their market value prior to the consideration of the other criteria mentioned above. Since the Companies have
limited ability to oversee the day-to-day management of nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, they do not have the ability to ensure investments are held through an anticipated recovery period. Accordingly, they consider all equity and
other securities as well as non-marketable investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts with market values below their cost bases to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

Inventories

Materials and supplies and fossil fuel inventories are valued primarily using the
weighted-average cost method. Stored gas inventory used in East Ohio gas distribution operations is valued using the LIFO method. Under the LIFO method, stored gas inventory was valued at $48 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Based on
the average price of gas purchased during 2011 and 2010, the cost of replacing the current portion of stored gas inventory exceeded the amount stated on a LIFO basis by approximately $86 million and $107 million, respectively. Stored gas inventory
held by Hope and certain nonregulated gas operations is valued using the weighted-average cost method.

Gas Imbalances

Natural gas imbalances occur when the physical amount of natural gas delivered from, or received by, a pipeline system or storage facility differs from
the contractual amount of natural gas
deliv-

ered or received. Dominion values these imbalances due to, or from, shippers and operators at an appropriate index price at period end, subject to the terms of its tariff for regulated entities.
Imbalances are primarily settled in-kind. Imbalances due to Dominion from other parties are reported in other current assets and imbalances that Dominion owes to other parties are reported in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Goodwill

Dominion evaluates
goodwill for impairment annually as of April 1 and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.

The FASB amended its guidance for the
recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, which Dominion and Virginia Power adopted effective April 1, 2009. The recognition provisions of this guidance apply only to debt securities classified as available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity, while the presentation and disclosure requirements apply to both debt and equity securities. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, as described in Note 2, the Companies considered all debt securities held by their nuclear
decommissioning trusts with market values below their cost bases to be other-than-temporarily impaired as they did not have the ability to ensure the investments were held through the anticipated recovery period.

Upon the adoption of this guidance for debt investments held at April 1, 2009, Dominion recorded a $20 million ($12 million
after-tax) and Virginia Power recorded a $3 million ($2 million after-tax) cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reclassify the non-credit related portion of previously recognized other-than-temporary impairments from retained
earnings to AOCI, reflecting the fixed-income investment managers’ intent and ability to hold the debt securities until recovery of their fair values up to their cost bases.

EPORTING

Effective December 31, 2009, Dominion adopted the SEC Final Rule,

Modernization
of Oil and Gas Reporting

, which revised the existing Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X reporting requirements. Under the new requirements, the ceiling test is calculated using an average price based on the prior 12-month period rather than
period-end prices. Due to the April 2010 sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations, Dominion no longer has any significant gas and oil properties subject to the ceiling test calculation.

Sale of Appalachian E&P Operations

In April 2010, Dominion completed the sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations to a newly-formed subsidiary of
CONSOL for approximately $3.5 billion. The transaction includes the mineral rights to approximately 491,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale formation. Dominion retained certain oil and natural gas wells located on or near its natural gas storage
fields. The transaction generated after-tax proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion and resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion, which includes a $134 million write-off of goodwill, recorded in the second quarter of 2010.

The results of operations for Dominion’s Appalachian E&P business are not reported as discontinued operations in the
Consolidated Statements of Income since Dominion did not sell its entire U.S. cost pool.

Due to the sale, hedge accounting was
discontinued for certain cash flow hedges since it became probable that the forecasted sales of gas would not occur. In connection with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for these contracts, Dominion recognized a $42 million ($25 million
after-tax) benefit, recorded in operating revenue in its Consolidated Statement of Income, reflecting the reclassification of gains from AOCI to earnings for these contracts in March 2010.

Sale of Peoples

In February 2010, Dominion completed the sale of Peoples to PNG Companies LLC and
netted after-tax proceeds of approximately $542 million. The sale resulted in an after-tax loss of approximately $140 million, including post-closing adjustments, and a $79 million write-off of goodwill. The sale also resulted in after-tax expenses
of approximately $27 million, including transaction and benefit-related costs. Prior to the sale, Peoples had income from operations of $12 million after-tax during 2010.

The following table presents selected information regarding the results of operations of Peoples, which are reported as dis-continued operations in Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Income:

Judgment and the use of
estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Dominion and
Virginia Power are routinely audited by federal and state tax authorities. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities
could be material.

In 2010, U.S. federal legislation was enacted that allows taxpayers to fully deduct qualifying capital
expenditures incurred after September 8, 2010, through the end of 2011, when placed in service before 2013, and otherwise provides an extension of the fifty percent bonus depreciation allowance for qualifying capital expenditures through 2012.

In December 2011, the IRS issued temporary regulations that provide guidance to taxpayers on the treatment of amounts paid to
acquire, produce or improve tangible property and of dispositions of such property. The temporary regulations generally are effective for expenditures made on or after January 1, 2012. Any changes for tax treatment elected by Dominion or
required by the regulations will be effective prospectively; however, implementation will require a calculation of the cumulative effect of the changes on prior years, and it is expected that such amount will have to be included in the determination
of Dominion’s taxable income in 2012, or possibly over a four-year period beginning in 2012. The IRS is expected to issue additional procedural guidance regarding 2012 tax return filing requirements and how the requirements may be implemented
for electric generation operations and gas transmission and distribution systems.

Dominion believes the evaluation and
implementation of the temporary regulations will require an extensive effort and may permit, or require, changes to how Dominion determines whether expenditures incurred related to plant and equipment should be deducted as repairs or capitalized and
depreciated on its tax returns. Since changes will be concerned with the timing for



deducting expenditures for tax purposes, the impact of implementation will be reflected in the amount of income taxes payable or receivable, cash flows from operations and deferred taxes. Except
to the extent the implementation impacts deferred taxes and, therefore, the rate base used to establish customer rates for regulated utilities, results of operations should not be materially affected. Pending the issuance of additional procedural
guidance from the IRS and progress of the evaluation process, Dominion cannot estimate the impact of implementing the temporary regulations.

Continuing Operations

Details of income tax
expense for continuing operations including noncontrolling interests were as follows:

(1)

In 2011, Dominion’s federal income tax expense includes a $346 million benefit related to its current year operating loss that is expected to be used in future
years, and state income tax expense reflects changes in the amount of income apportioned among states, higher tax credits, claims for refunds and previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of statutes of limitations.

(2)

In 2011, Virginia Power’s federal income tax expense includes a $54 million benefit related to a portion of its current year operating loss that is expected to
be used in future years. Also, in 2011 and 2010, Virginia Power’s federal income tax expense reflects the amounts of current year operating losses realized through its participation in a tax sharing agreement with Dominion and its subsidiaries.

For continuing operations including noncontrolling interests, the statutory U.S. federal
income tax rate reconciles to Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s effective income tax rate as follows:

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s effective tax rates in 2010 reflect reductions of deferred tax
assets of $57 million and $17 million, respectively, resulting from the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, which eliminated the employer’s
deduction, beginning in 2013, for that portion of its retiree prescription drug coverage cost that is being reimbursed by the Medicare Part D subsidy. In addition, Dominion’s effective tax rate in 2010 includes higher state income taxes and the
impact of goodwill written off that is not deductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the Appalachian E&P operations.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

The Companies’ deferred income taxes consist of the following:

At December 31, 2011, Dominion had the following deductible loss and credit carryforwards:

Ÿ

Federal loss carryforwards of $1.0 billion that expire if unutilized during the period 2021 through 2031;

Ÿ

Federal production tax credits of $13 million that expire if unutilized through 2031;

Ÿ

State loss carryforwards of $1.1 billion that expire if unutilized during the period 2014 through 2031. A valuation allowance on $866 million of these
carryforwards has been established;

Ÿ

State minimum tax credits of $101 million that do not expire;

Ÿ

State investment tax credits of $6 million that expire if unutilized through 2014; and

Ÿ

State investment tax credits of $3 million that do not expire.

At December 31, 2011, Virginia Power had the following deductible loss and credit carryforwards:

Ÿ

Federal loss carryforwards of $157 million that expire if unutilized through 2031; and

Ÿ

State minimum tax credits of $1 million that do not expire.

Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be
examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The amount of tax return positions that are not recognized in the financial statements is disclosed as unrecognized tax benefits. These unrecognized tax benefits may impact
the financial statements by increasing income taxes payable, reducing tax refunds receivable or changing deferred taxes. Also, when uncertainty about the deductibility of an amount is limited to the timing of such deductibility, an increase in taxes
payable (or reduction in tax refunds receivable) is accompanied by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities.

A reconciliation of changes in the Companies’ unrecognized tax benefits follows:

Certain unrecognized tax benefits, or portions thereof, if recognized, would affect the effective tax
rate. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from claims for tax benefits, or portions thereof, that may not be realized, remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of
limitation. For Dominion and its subsidiaries, these unrecognized tax benefits were $184 million, $133 million and $95 million at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For Dominion, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits
increased income tax expense by $51 million in 2011 and $38 million in 2010 and decreased income tax expense by $26 million in 2009. For Virginia Power, these unrecognized tax benefits were $20 million at December 31, 2011 and $14 million at
December 31, 2010 and 2009. For Virginia Power, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits increased income tax expense by $6 million in 2011 and by less than $1 million in 2010 and decreased income tax expense by $7 million in 2009.

A portion of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s unrecognized tax benefits balances at December 31, 2011 represents
tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain; however, there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. When uncertainty about the deductibility of amounts is limited to the timing of such deductibility, any tax
liabilities recognized for prior periods would be subject to offset with the availability of refundable amounts from later periods when such deductions could otherwise be taken. Pending resolution of these uncertainties, interest is accrued until
the period in which the amounts would become deductible.

For Dominion and its subsidiaries, the U.S. federal statute of
limitations has expired for years prior to 2006, except that Dominion has reserved the right to pursue refunds related to the calculation of interest to be capitalized in connection with improvements to in-service plant and equipment for the years
1995 through 2005. The IRS position provides that capitalized interest must also be computed on the adjusted tax basis of in-service assets that are idled while making improvements to them. In response to litigation initiated by Dominion in March
2008, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled in February 2011, sustaining the IRS position. In July 2011, Dominion



filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Dominion believes the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on its cash flows,
results of operations or financial condition.

In January 2012, the Appellate Division of the IRS informed Dominion that the
Joint Committee had completed its review of the settlement of tax years 2004 and 2005 for Dominion and its consolidated subsidiaries. Since the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits in 2011 considered the results of completed settlement
negotiations, Dominion’s results of operations in 2012 will not be affected.

In 2011, the IRS completed its fieldwork in
the examination of Dominion’s consolidated tax returns for tax years 2006 and 2007. Dominion and the IRS have resolved all issues, except Dominion is reserving the right to pursue a refund related to the capitalized interest issue that is
currently being litigated.

The IRS examination of tax years 2008, 2009 and 2010 will begin in the first quarter of 2012.

It is reasonably possible that resolution of the litigation related to capitalized interest and settlements with and payments
to tax authorities in 2012 could reduce unrecognized tax benefits for Dominion and Virginia Power by $24 million and $15 million, respectively. Dominion’s unrecognized tax benefits could also be reduced by up to $18 million, including
$8 million for Virginia Power, to recognize prior period amounts becoming otherwise deductible in 2012 and the expiration of statutes of limitations. If such changes were to occur, other than revisions of the accrual for interest on tax
underpayments and overpayments, Dominion’s earnings could increase by up to $7 million with no material impact on Virginia Power’s earnings.

Otherwise, with regard to 2011 and prior years, Dominion and Virginia Power cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible changes to unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in 2012.

For each of the major states in which Dominion operates, the earliest tax year remaining open for examination is as follows:

(1)

Virginia is the only state considered major for Virginia Power’s operations.

Dominion and Virginia Power are also obligated to report adjustments resulting from IRS settlements to state tax authorities. In addition,
if Dominion utilizes operating losses or tax credits generated in years for which the statute of limitations has expired, such amounts are subject to examination.

Discontinued Operations

Income tax expense in 2010 for Dominion’s discontinued operations
primarily reflects the impact of goodwill written off in the sale of Peoples that is not deductible for tax purposes and the reversal of deferred taxes for which the benefit was offset by the reversal of income tax-related regulatory assets.

EASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. However, the use of a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between bid and ask prices) is permitted. Fair values are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset
or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in valuation techniques and the inputs to valuations. This includes not only the credit standing of counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements but also the
impact of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s own nonperformance risk on their liabilities. Fair value measurements assume that the transaction occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability (the market with the most volume and
activity for the asset or liability from the perspective of the reporting entity), or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability (the market in which the reporting entity would be able to maximize
the amount received or minimize the amount paid). Dominion and Virginia Power apply fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities including commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, and nuclear decommissioning trust and other
investments including those held in Dominion’s rabbi, pension and other postretirement benefit plan trusts, in accordance with the requirements described above. The Companies apply credit adjustments to their derivative fair values in
accordance with the requirements described above. These credit adjustments are currently not material to the derivative fair values.

The Companies maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the
absence of actively-quoted market prices, they seek price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, they consider whether
the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing
information from external sources is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases they must estimate prices based on
available historical and near-term future price information and certain statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect their market assumptions.

For options and contracts with option-like characteristics where observable pricing information is not available from external sources, the Companies generally use a modified Black-Scholes Model that
considers time value, the volatility of the underlying commodities and other relevant assumptions when estimating fair value. The Companies use other option models under special circumstances, including a Spread Approximation Model when contracts
include different commodities or commodity locations and a Swing Option Model when contracts allow either the buyer or seller the ability to exercise within a range of quantities. For contracts with unique characteristics, the



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

Companies may estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow approach deemed appropriate in the circumstances and applied consistently from period to period. For individual contracts, the use
of different valuation models or assumptions could have a significant effect on the contract’s estimated fair value.

Dominion and Virginia Power regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to estimate fair value by a number of methods, including review and verification of models, as well as various market price
verification procedures such as the use of pricing services and multiple broker quotes to support the market price of the various commodities and investments in which the Companies transact.

The Companies also utilize the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value, into three broad levels:

Ÿ

Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that they have the ability to access at the measurement
date. Instruments categorized in Level 1 primarily consist of financial instruments such as the majority of exchange-traded derivatives, and exchange-listed equities, mutual funds and certain Treasury securities held in nuclear decommissioning trust
funds for Dominion and Virginia Power and rabbi and benefit plan trust funds for Dominion.

Ÿ

Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability,
including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and

inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means. Instruments categorized in Level 2 primarily include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter
commodity forwards and swaps, interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and options, certain Treasury securities, money market funds, and corporate, state and municipal debt securities held in nuclear decommissioning trust funds for Dominion
and Virginia Power and rabbi and benefit plan trust funds for Dominion.

Ÿ

Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or
liability. Instruments categorized in Level 3 for Dominion and Virginia Power consist of long-dated commodity derivatives, FTRs and other modeled commodity derivatives. Additional instruments categorized in Level 3 for Dominion include NGLs and
natural gas peaking options and alternative investments, consisting of investments in partnerships, joint ventures and other alternative investments, held in benefit plan trust funds.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the
applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.

Fair value measurements are categorized as Level 3 when a significant amount of price or other inputs that are considered to be
unobservable are used in their valuations. Long-dated commodity derivatives are generally based on unobservable inputs due to the length of time to settlement and the absence of market activity and are therefore categorized as Level 3. For NGL
derivatives, market illiquidity requires a valuation based on proxy markets that do not always correlate to the actual instrument, therefore they are categorized as Level 3. FTRs are categorized as Level 3 fair value measurements because the only
relevant pricing available comes from ISO auctions, which are generally not considered to be liquid markets. Other modeled commodity derivatives have unobservable inputs in their valuation, mostly due to non-transparent and illiquid markets.
Alternative investments are categorized as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, illiquidity and the long-term nature of these assets. These investments are generally valued using NAV based on the proportionate share of the fair value
as determined by reference to the most recent audited fair value financial statements or fair value statements provided by the investment manager adjusted for any significant events occurring between the investment manager’s and the
Companies’ measurement date.

For derivative contracts, Dominion and Virginia Power recognize transfers among Level 1,
Level 2 and Level 3 based on fair values as of the first day of the month in which the transfer occurs. Transfers out of Level 3 represent assets and liabilities that were previously classified as Level 3 for which the inputs became
observable for classification in either Level 1 or Level 2. Because the activity and liquidity of commodity markets vary substantially between regions and time periods, the availability of observable



inputs for substantially the full term and value of the Companies’ over-the-counter derivative contracts is subject to change.

At December 31, 2011, Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s net balance of commodity derivatives categorized as Level 3 fair
value measurements was a net liability of $71 million and $28 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would increase Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s net liability by $73 million and $2 million, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% decrease in commodity prices would decrease Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s net liability by $74 million and $2 million, respectively.

TATIONS

In June 2010, Dominion evaluated State Line for impairment due to the station’s
relatively low level of profitability combined with the EPA’s issuance of a new stringent 1-hour primary NAAQS for
SO


that would likely require significant environmental
capital expenditures in the future. As a result of this evaluation, Dominion recorded an impairment charge of $163 million ($107 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income, to write
down State Line’s long-lived assets to their estimated fair value of $59 million.

During March 2011, Dominion determined
that it was unlikely that State Line would participate in the May 2011 PJM capacity base residual auction that would commit State Line’s capacity from June 2014 through May 2015. This determination reflected an expectation that margins for
coal-fired generation will remain compressed in the 2014 and 2015 period in combination with the expectation that State Line may be impacted during the same time period by environmental regulations that would likely require significant capital
expenditures. As a result, Dominion evaluated State Line for impairment since it was more likely than not that State Line would be retired before the end of its previously estimated useful life. As a result of this evaluation, Dominion
recorded an impairment charge of $55 million ($39 million after-tax) reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income, to write down State Line’s long-lived assets to their estimated fair value of
less than $1 million.

In December 2010, Dominion recorded an impairment charge of $31 million ($20 million after-tax) in other
operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income, to write down the long-lived assets of Salem Harbor to their estimated fair value of less than $1 million as a result of profitability issues.

As management was not aware of any recent market transactions for comparable assets with
sufficient transparency to develop a market approach to fair value, Dominion used the income approach (discounted cash flows) to estimate the fair value of State Line’s and Salem Harbor’s long-lived assets in these impairment tests. These
were considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant unobservable inputs including estimates of future power and other commodity prices.

LLOWANCES

In September 2010,
Virginia Power evaluated its SO


emissions allowances not
expected to be consumed by its generating units for potential impairment due to the significant decline in market prices since the July 2010 release of the EPA’s proposed replacement rule for CAIR, ultimately known as CSAPR. As a result of
this evaluation, Virginia Power recorded an impairment charge of $13 million ($8 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income, to write down its SO


emissions allowances not expected to be consumed to their estimated fair
value of less than $1 million.

In the third quarter of 2011, Dominion and Virginia Power evaluated their
SO


emissions allowances not expected to be consumed by
generating units for potential impairment due to the EPA’s issuance of CSAPR as discussed in Note 23. Prior to the issuance of CSAPR, Dominion and Virginia Power held $57 million and $43 million, respectively, of SO


emissions allowances obtained for ARP and CAIR compliance. Due to
CSAPR’s establishment of a new allowance program and the elimination of CAIR, Dominion and Virginia Power have more
SO


emissions allowances than needed for ARP compliance. As a
result of this evaluation, Dominion and Virginia Power recorded an impairment charge of $57 million ($34 million after-tax) and $43 million ($26 million after-tax), respectively, in other operations and maintenance expense in their Consolidated
Statements of Income, to write down these emissions allowances to their estimated fair value of less than $1 million.

To estimate the value of these emissions allowances in both impairment tests, Dominion utilized a market approach by obtaining broker quotes to validate CSAPR’s impact on emissions allowance prices.
However, due to limited market activity for future SO


vintage year allowances, these are considered a Level 3 fair value measurement.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Substantially all of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s financial instruments are recorded at fair value, with the exception of the instruments described below that are reported at historical cost.
Estimated fair values have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies considered appropriate by management. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, customer and other receivables, short-term debt and
accounts payable are representative of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, the carrying amounts and fair values
are as follows:

(1)

Fair value is estimated using market prices, where available, and interest rates currently available for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities. The carrying amount of debt issues with short-term maturities and variable rates refinanced at current market rates is a reasonable estimate of their fair value.

Dominion and Virginia Power are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products
they market and purchase, as well as currency exchange and interest rate risks of their business operations. The Companies use derivative instruments to manage exposure to these risks, and designate certain derivative instruments as fair value or
cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. As discussed in Note 2, for jurisdictions subject to cost-based rate regulation, changes in the fair value of derivatives are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities until the related

discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain cash flow hedges in 2010, as discussed in Note 4.

In addition, changes to
Dominion’s financing needs during the first and second quarters of 2010 resulted in the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain cash flow hedges since it was determined that the forecasted interest payments would not occur. In connection
with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for these contracts, Dominion recognized a benefit recorded to interest and related charges reflecting the reclassification of gains from AOCI to earnings of $110 million ($67 million after-tax) for 2010.
The reclassification of gains from AOCI to earnings was partially offset by subsequent changes in fair value for these contracts of $37 million ($23 million after-tax) for 2010.

ATTERS

As a result of
issues generated in the ordinary course of business, Dominion and Virginia Power are involved in various regulatory matters. Certain regulatory matters may ultimately result in a loss; however, as such matters are in an initial procedural phase,
involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending reviews or orders, or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, such that it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For such matters that the
Companies cannot estimate, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the regulatory process such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For
regulatory matters for which the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in

excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. This estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. This
estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Companies’ maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such regulatory matters will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate.
For current matters not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the outcome from such matters would have a material effect on Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
The following is a discussion of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s material pending and recent regulatory matters.

Electric
Regulation in Virginia

The enactment of the Regulation Act in 2007 significantly changed electric service regulation in Virginia by
instituting a modified cost-of-service rate model. With respect to most classes of customers, the Regulation Act ended Virginia’s planned transition to retail competition for its electric supply service.

The Regulation Act authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation projects, FERC-approved
transmission costs, environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs. It provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures on specific new generation projects, including but not limited to
combined cycle gas generation, nuclear generation, clean coal/carbon capture compatible generation, and renewable generation projects. The Regulation Act also continues statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to file annual fuel cost recovery
cases with the Virginia Commission.

If the Virginia Commission’s future rate decisions, including actions relating to
Virginia Power’s rate adjustment clause filings, differ materially from Virginia Power’s expectations, it may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

2009 Base Rate Review

Pursuant to the
Regulation Act, the Virginia Commission initiated a review of Virginia Power’s base rates, terms and conditions in 2009, including a review of Virginia Power’s earnings for test year 2008. In March 2010, the Virginia Commission issued the
Virginia Settlement Approval Order, thus concluding the 2009 case and resolving open issues relating to Virginia Power’s base rates, fuel factor and Riders R, S, T, C1 and C2. Virginia Power’s fourth quarter 2009 results included a charge
of $782 million ($477 million after-tax) as a result of the 2009 Base Rate Review. Dominion’s 2009 results include an additional charge of $12 million ($8 million after-tax) recorded in other operations and maintenance expense, reflecting the
write-off of previously deferred RTO costs since recovery was no longer probable based on the 2009 Base Rate Review.

2011 Biennial Review

Pursuant to the Regulation Act and the Virginia Settlement Approval Order, in March 2011, Virginia Power submitted its base rate filing
and accompanying schedules in support of the first biennial review of its base rates, terms and conditions, as well as of its earnings for the 2009 and 2010 test period. The biennial review included a determination of whether Virginia Power’s



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

earnings for the 2009 and 2010 combined test years were within 50 basis points of the authorized ROE of
11.9% established in the Virginia Settlement Approval Order, as well as authorization of an ROE which will be applicable to base rates and Riders R, S, C1 and C2 and which will be used to measure base rate earnings during the 2013 biennial review
proceeding. As a result of the Virginia Settlement Approval Order and the Regulation Act, Virginia Power’s base rates are not subject to change based on the 2011 biennial review. In November 2011, the Virginia Commission issued the Biennial
Review Order.

Base ROE

The
Virginia Commission determined that Virginia Power’s new authorized ROE is 10.9%, inclusive of a performance incentive of 50 basis points for meeting certain RPS targets. Subject to the outcome of Virginia Power’s petition for rehearing or
reconsideration described below, this ROE will serve as the ROE against which Virginia Power’s earned return will be compared for all or part of the test periods in the 2013 biennial review proceeding. The Virginia Commission ordered that the
50 basis point RPS performance incentive will not be included in the ROE applicable to any rate adjustment clauses. The Virginia Commission declined to award a performance incentive for generating plant performance, customer service or operating
efficiency in connection with this biennial review, but instead will initiate a rulemaking proceeding to develop performance incentive criteria to be applied in future biennial review proceedings.

In December 2011, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission seeking rehearing or reconsideration of the Biennial Review
Order, to confirm the effective date of the newly authorized 10.9% base ROE. In December 2011, Virginia Power also filed a Notice of Appeal with the Virginia Commission of the Biennial Review Order to the Supreme Court of Virginia.

ROE Applicable to Riders C1, C2, R, and S

Effective December 1, 2011, the ROE applicable to Riders C1 and C2 is 10.4%. An ROE of 11.3% applied through November 30, 2011.

For Riders R and S, effective December 1, 2011, the ROE is 11.4%, inclusive of a statutory enhancement of 100 basis points. An
ROE of 12.3%, inclusive of a statutory enhancement of 100 basis points, applied through November 30, 2011.

Earned Return for 2009 and

The Virginia Commission determined that Virginia Power earned an ROE of approximately 13.3% during the 2009 and 2010 combined test
years, which exceeded the authorized ROE earnings band of 11.4% to 12.4% established in the Virginia Settlement Approval Order. Based on the determination that Virginia Power had excess earnings, the Virginia Commission ordered Virginia Power to
refund 60% of earnings above the upper end of the authorized ROE earnings band, or approximately $78 million, to its customers, which is being provided in the form of credits to customers’ bills amortized over a six-month period during 2012. A
charge for the refund was recognized in operating revenues in the 2011 Consolidated Statement of Income. The actual aggregate refund amount is expected to total approximately $81 million, taking into account refunds to be paid to certain
non-jurisdictional customers pursuant to their customer contracts.

Base Rates and Existing Riders T, C1, and C2

As a result of the Virginia Commission’s determination that credits will be applied to customers’ bills, the Virginia Commission, as required by
the Regulation Act, directed Virginia Power to combine its existing Riders T, C1, and C2 with Virginia Power’s base costs, revenues and investments, and to file revised tariffs reflecting such combination pursuant to the Biennial Review Order.
These Riders will thereafter be considered part of Virginia Power’s base costs, revenues and investments for purposes of future biennial review proceedings. The Virginia Commission has initiated a proceeding to address further implementation of
this directive. Virginia Power’s base rates will otherwise remain unchanged through at least December 1, 2013.

Earnings Test
Adjustments

The Virginia Commission ruled on numerous contested proposals to adjust Virginia Power’s earnings for the 2009 and 2010
combined test periods. Among other adjustments, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power’s ratemaking treatment of fuel inventories held by its wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a result of this finding, Virginia Power included in rate base
approximately $177 million and $188 million in fuel inventory costs for 2009 and 2010, respectively. The Virginia Commission also adopted Virginia Power’s treatment that includes, for regulatory earnings purposes, its AIP and LTIP expenses up
to a 100% payout ratio. The Virginia Commission excluded from expense approximately $21 million in incentive plan costs that exceeded a payout ratio of 100%, allowing a net recovery of approximately $95 million of incentive compensation expense for
the biennial review period. The Virginia Commission denied Virginia Power’s ratemaking treatment that expensed the entire cost of its 2010 voluntary separation plan in 2010, ruling instead to amortize the cost through the end of 2011. This
matches the costs of the plan with the period of realization of savings, which reduces 2010 operating costs (and, in turn, increases 2011 operating costs) by approximately $103 million for purposes of the earnings test. Other than influencing the
amount earned above the authorized ROE earnings band, the earnings test adjustments above did not have an impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, the Virginia Commission required Virginia Power to recognize a gain, for purposes of the earnings test, of approximately $44 million on the settlement of certain interest rate hedging
contracts in 2010, as opposed to amortizing the gains over the forecasted term of planned debt instruments that were not issued.

Virginia Power determined that it was no longer probable that these derivative gains would be included in future
base rates as the Virginia Commission would not allow the amortization of these amounts in future periods. As a result, Virginia Power removed approximately $50 million in December 2011 from regulatory liabilities and recognized the deferred
derivative settlement gains in Interest and Other Charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Virginia Fuel Expenses

In May 2011, Virginia Power submitted its annual fuel factor filing to the Virginia Commission, proposing an annual increase for the rate year beginning
July 1, 2011. This revised factor included a projected $434 million balance of prior year under- recovered fuel expenses. To reduce the impact to customers, as an alternative, Virginia Power proposed to recover this projected



prior year deferred fuel balance over a two-year period beginning July 1, 2011. In June 2011, the Virginia Commission approved the two-year recovery proposal, resulting in an increase of
approximately $319 million in annual fuel revenue for the rate year beginning July 1, 2011. The rate increase is designed to recover $217 million of unrecovered fuel expenses from the prior fuel year as well as a $102 million increase in
anticipated fuel expenses for the 2012 fuel year.

Generation Riders R and S

In connection with the Bear Garden and Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center projects, in March 2011, the Virginia Commission approved annual updates for Riders R and S with revenue requirements of $78
million and $199 million, respectively, for the April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012 rate year, utilizing the 12.3% placeholder ROE (inclusive of a 100 basis point statutory enhancement) pending the Virginia Commission’s ROE determination
in the 2011 biennial review. Virginia Power’s proposed revenue requirements for Riders R and S for the April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 rate year were adjusted to approximately $76 million and $231 million, respectively, and are
pending final Virginia Commission approval. Future annual updates for Riders R and S will provide revenue requirements reflecting any true-ups to revenue requirements approved for the previous calendar year, including the ROE determined in the
Biennial Review Order. Construction of Bear Garden was completed and the facility commenced commercial operations in the second quarter of 2011.

DSM Riders C1 and C2

In connection with
Virginia Power’s five DSM programs approved by the Virginia Commission, in March 2011, the Virginia Commission approved the annual updates for Riders C1 and C2 with revenue requirements of approximately $6 million and $12 million, respectively,
for the April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012 rate year, utilizing an 11.3% placeholder ROE pending the Virginia Commission’s ROE determination in the 2011 biennial review. By order issued in June 2011, the Virginia Commission extended the
rates through April 2012.

In September 2011, Virginia Power filed with the Virginia Commission an application for approval of
six new energy efficiency DSM programs, along with an annual update to Riders C1 and C2. Virginia Power’s proposed revenue requirement for the May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013 rate year is approximately $72 million, as amended in February
2012 to reflect, along with other adjustments, the determination of a 10.4% ROE applicable to Riders C1 and C2 in the Biennial Review Order. As discussed above, previously implemented Riders C1 and C2 will be considered part of Virginia Power’s
base costs, revenues and investments for purposes of future biennial review proceedings, and the Virginia Commission has initiated a proceeding to address further implementation of this directive.

Transmission Rider T

In May 2011,
Virginia Power filed its annual update to Rider T with the Virginia Commission. The proposed $481 million annual revenue requirement, effective September 1, 2011, represented an increase of approximately $144 million over the revenue
requirement associated with the Rider T customer rates previously in effect. In July 2011, the Virginia Commission issued

an order approving a revenue requirement of $466 million for the September 1, 2011 to August 31, 2012 rate year. As discussed above, previously implemented Rider T will be considered
part of Virginia Power’s base costs, revenues and investments for purposes of future biennial review proceedings, and the Virginia Commission has initiated a proceeding to address further implementation of this directive.

Generation Rider W

In May 2011, Virginia
Power requested approval from the Virginia Commission to construct and operate Warren County, as well as approval of Rider W. In February 2012, the Virginia Commission approved Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity for Warren County and
related transmission facilities. The Virginia Commission also approved Virginia Power’s proposed revised revenue requirement of $35 million for the April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 rate year, reflecting an ROE of 11.4%, inclusive of a statutory
enhancement of 100 basis points for Rider W, consistent with the Biennial Review Order. In addition, the Virginia Commission approved an ROE enhancement of 100 basis points for Rider W for a period of 10 years following commercial operations. The
facility is expected to start commercial operations in late 2014.

Generation Rider B

In June 2011, Virginia Power filed applications with the Virginia Commission seeking regulatory approval to convert three of its coal-fired power stations
to biomass. The applications included a request for approval of Rider B. Virginia Power’s proposed revenue requirement for Rider B is approximately $6 million for the April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 rate year, as adjusted to reflect
the base ROE authorized in the Biennial Review Order, and inclusive of a renewable generating unit statutory enhancement of 200 basis points. To qualify for federal production tax credits associated with renewable energy generation, the power
stations must commence operation as biomass generation facilities by December 31, 2013. Virginia Power has requested Virginia Commission approval of the biomass conversions on a schedule that will enable qualification for these tax credits.

Solar Distributed Generation Demonstration Program

In October 2011, Virginia Power filed with the Virginia Commission an application to conduct a solar distributed generation demonstration program, consisting of up to a combined 30 MW of Company-owned
solar distributed generation facilities to be located at selected commercial, industrial and community locations throughout its Virginia service territory, as well as up to a combined 3 MW of customer-owned solar distributed generation facilities
that will be subject to a tariff filed with the Virginia Commission in 2012. Virginia Power proposed to construct and operate the Company-owned facilities in two phases, with Phase I (up to 10 MW) from the date of approval through the end of 2013
and Phase II (up to 20 MW) from the beginning of 2014 to the end of 2015. Virginia Power did not seek a rate adjustment clause for Phase I facilities with this filing; Phase I costs will be recovered as part of base rates in a future biennial
review. Virginia Power indicated that it may seek a rate adjustment clause at a future time for Phase II costs.

Electric Transmission Projects

Portions of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line and certain associated facilities are approaching the end of their expected service lives and require replacement with new facilities to maintain reliable service.
Virginia Power owns, and has been designated by PJM to rebuild, 96 miles of the line in West Virginia and Virginia, and The Potomac Edison Company owns, and has been designated by PJM to rebuild, the remaining three miles of the line in Maryland. In
September 2011, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power’s application to rebuild its portion of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line. The approval of the West Virginia Commission was not required. Subject to applicable state and federal
regulatory approvals, Virginia Power’s portion of the rebuild project is expected to be completed by June 2015.

In
October 2008, the Virginia Commission authorized construction of the Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun line and Carson-to-Suffolk line. The Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun line was placed in service in April 2011 and the Carson-to-Suffolk line was placed in service
in May 2011.

In June 2010, the Virginia Commission authorized the construction of the Hayes-to-Yorktown line along the
proposed eight-mile route utilizing existing easements and property previously acquired for the transmission line right-of-way. In accordance with the Virginia Commission’s approval, approximately 4.2 miles of the Hayes-to-Yorktown line will be
constructed overhead and approximately 3.8 miles will be installed underground in order to cross under the York River. The Hayes-to-Yorktown line is expected to be completed by June 2012.

In January 2012, the Virginia Commission authorized the replacement at higher voltage of approximately 43 miles of existing transmission
lines between the Dooms and Bremo substations. Subject to the receipt of other applicable state and federal regulatory approvals, Dooms-to-Bremo is expected to be completed by May 2014.

In December 2011, Viginia Power submitted an application to the Virginia Commission for approval of the Waxpool-Brambleton-BECO line. This
project is required to provide requested service to a new datacenter campus in Loudoun County, Virginia. Virginia Power expects PJM to authorize Waxpool-Brambleton-BECO as part of the 2012 RTEP within the first half of 2012. Subject to the
receipt of applicable state and federal regulatory approvals, Waxpool-Brambleton-BECO is expected to be completed by November 2013.

North
Anna Power Station

Virginia Power is considering the construction of a third nuclear unit at a site located at North Anna, which Virginia
Power owns along with ODEC. In May 2010, Virginia Power announced its decision to replace the reactor design previously selected for the potential third nuclear unit with the US-APWR technology. In June 2010, Virginia Power and ODEC amended the COL
application to reflect the selection of the US-APWR technology. In January 2011, Virginia Power and the DOE terminated their cooperative agreement to share equally the cost of developing a COL. The agreement references the technology previously
selected by Virginia Power. DOE funding related to COL development activities is not available under the agreement for activities related to the US-APWR technology. In February 2011, ODEC informed Virginia Power of its intent to no longer
partic-

ipate in the development of a potential new unit at North Anna. In December 2011, Virginia Power acquired ODEC’s interest in the project, thereby terminating ODEC’s involvement in
the development of a potential third unit at North Anna.

Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit
at North Anna. If Virginia Power decides to build the new unit, it must first receive a COL from the NRC, the approval of the Virginia Commission and certain environmental permits and other approvals. Virginia Power continues to pursue the COL from
the NRC. Based on the current NRC schedule, the COL could be issued as early as late 2014.

The NRC is required to conduct a
hearing in all COL proceedings. In August 2008, the ASLB of the NRC permitted BREDL to intervene in the proceeding. All of BREDL’s previous contentions in this proceeding have been dismissed. In September 2011, BREDL submitted a new proposed
contention seeking to litigate issues related to the August 2011 Mineral, Virginia earthquake. In October 2011, the ASLB granted a motion filed by Virginia Power, with the consent of BREDL and the NRC staff to hold any ruling on this proposed
contention in abeyance until Virginia Power completes an assessment of this earthquake. No other persons have sought to intervene in the proceeding. If a new contention is not admitted, the mandatory NRC hearing will be uncontested with respect
to other issues.

On April 14, 2011, twenty-one organizations and individuals that had previously intervened opposing
various reactor licensing proceedings filed a petition requesting that the NRC suspend all decisions regarding reactor licensing and design certification pending completion of an NRC task force review of the events at Fukushima, Japan, among other
requested relief. The North Anna 3 COL proceeding is one of the pending proceedings identified in this petition, and BREDL served the petition in the North Anna 3 COL proceeding on April 18, 2011. In September 2011, the NRC denied the
petitioners’ requests to suspend licensing and design certification proceedings. The only relief granted was the petitioners’ request that the NRC perform a safety analysis of the regulatory implications of the Fukushima event to the
extent it is doing so.

Virginia Power continues to pursue various environmental permits that would be needed to support future
construction and operation of a third nuclear unit at North Anna.

North Carolina Regulation

In February 2010, in preparation for the end of a five-year moratorium on Virginia Power’s North Carolina base rates, Virginia Power filed an
application with the North Carolina Commission to increase its base rates and adjust its fuel rates. In December 2010, the North Carolina Commission issued the North Carolina Settlement Approval Order approving a settlement agreement among all
parties to the base rate and fuel case except one, which did not oppose the settlement. The North Carolina Settlement Approval Order authorized an increase in base revenues of approximately $8 million. In addition, the North Carolina Settlement
Approval Order allowed the recovery through fuel rates of 85% of the net energy costs of power purchases from both PJM and other wholesale suppliers and from the non-utility generators subject to economic dispatch that do not provide actual cost
data. The North Carolina Settlement Approval Order authorized an ROE of 10.7% and a capital structure composed of



49% long-term debt and 51% common equity. The new base and fuel rates became effective on January 1, 2011.

In December 2011, the North Carolina Commission issued an order approving a settlement agreement among Virginia Power, the Public Staff of the North Carolina Commission and other interested parties in
Virginia Power’s fuel case for its North Carolina service territory. The settlement agreement provides for a $36 million increase in Virginia Power’s fuel revenues for one year, effective January 1, 2012, including approximately $13
million in under recovery of fuel expenses for the previous fuel period.

Virginia Power intends to file an application with
the North Carolina Commission by March 30, 2012, to increase base rates.

Ohio Regulation

PIR Program

In March 2011, East Ohio filed a request with the Ohio Commission to
accelerate the PIR program by nearly doubling its PIR spending to more than $200 million annually. East Ohio identified 1,450 miles of pipeline that need to be replaced, in addition to the pipeline originally identified in the PIR project scope.
East Ohio plans to accelerate the pace of the program by investing more resources in its infrastructure in the near term, in an effort to promote ongoing public safety and reduce operating costs over the longer term. In August 2011, the Ohio
Commission approved the stipulation by East Ohio, the Staff of the Ohio Commission and other interested parties in East Ohio’s accelerated PIR proceeding. The stipulation provides for an increase in annual PIR capital investment from the
current level of approximately $120 million stepping up to approximately $160 million by 2013. In addition, the stipulation provides for cost recovery over a five-year period commencing upon the approval of the Ohio Commission. In accordance with
the stipulation, East Ohio requested the dismissal of its appeal at the Ohio Supreme Court regarding its opposition to the Ohio Commission’s order concerning East Ohio’s first year PIR cost recovery charge.

In August 2011, East Ohio submitted its annual application to adjust the cost recovery charge under the previously approved PIR program. A
supplement to the application was filed in September 2011. The proposed recovery charge includes actual costs and a return related to investments made through June 30, 2011. A settlement agreement approved by the Ohio Commission in October 2011
supports the revenue requirement of $37 million reflected in the application.

PIPP Plus Program

Under the Ohio PIPP Plus program, eligible customers can receive energy assistance based on their ability to pay their bill. The difference between the
customer’s total bill and the PIPP plan payment amount is deferred and collected under the PIPP rider in accordance with the rules of the Ohio Commission. The PIPP Plus program sets the customer’s monthly payments at 6% of household income
and provides for forgiveness credits to the customer’s balance when required payments are received in full by the due date. Such credits may result in the elimination of the customer’s arrearage balance over 24 months.

In March 2011, the Ohio Commission approved East Ohio’s annual update of the PIPP Rider, which reflected the elimination of
accumulated arrearages and projected deferred program costs of approximately $112 million for the 12-month period from April 2011 to March 2012.

UEX Rider

East Ohio files an annual UEX Rider with the Ohio Commission, pursuant to which it seeks recovery of the bad debt expense of most customers not participating in the PIPP Plus Program. The UEX Rider is
adjusted annually to achieve dollar-for-dollar recovery of East Ohio’s actual write-offs of uncollectable amounts. In 2011, East Ohio deferred approximately $62 million of bad debt expense for recovery through the UEX Rider.

House Bill 95

Ohio enacted utility
reform legislation under House Bill 95, which became effective in September 2011. This law updates natural gas legislation by enabling gas companies to include more up-to-date cost levels when filing rate cases. It also allows gas companies to seek
approval of capital expenditure plans under which gas companies can recognize carrying costs on associated capital investments placed in service and can defer the carrying costs plus depreciation and property tax expenses for recovery from
ratepayers in the future. In December 2011, East Ohio filed an application requesting authority to implement a capital expenditure program under the new law. If the application is approved, East Ohio would be able to defer as a regulatory asset
carrying costs, depreciation and property tax associated with approximately $95 million in capital expenditures for assets placed in service but not yet reflected in rates.

Federal Regulation

FERC—Electric

Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Virginia Power
purchases and sells electricity in the PJM wholesale market and Dominion’s merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM, MISO and ISO-NE wholesale markets under Dominion’s market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC. In addition,
Virginia Power has FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Power’s service territory. Any
such sales would be voluntary.

Rates

In April 2008, FERC granted an application for Virginia Power’s electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual
basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January 1, 2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which
is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure.

In July 2008, Virginia Power filed an application with FERC requesting a revision to its revenue requirement to reflect an additional ROE incentive adder for eleven electric transmission enhancement
projects. Under the proposal, the cost of transmission service would increase to include an ROE incentive adder for each of the eleven projects, beginning the date each project enters commercial operation (but not before January 1, 2009).
Virginia Power proposed an incentive of 1.5% for four of the



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

projects (including the Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun and Carson-to-Suffolk lines, which were completed in 2011) and an incentive of 1.25% for the other seven projects. In August 2008, FERC approved
the proposal, effective September 1, 2008. The total cost for all eleven projects is estimated at $877 million, and all projects are currently expected to be completed by 2012. Numerous parties sought rehearing of the FERC order in August 2008,
and rehearing is pending. Although Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the rehearing, it is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations.

In March 2010, ODEC and NCEMC filed a complaint with FERC against Virginia Power claiming that approximately $223 million in transmission costs related to specific projects were unjust, unreasonable and
unduly discriminatory or preferential and should be excluded from Virginia Power’s transmission formula rate. ODEC and NCEMC requested that FERC establish procedures to determine the amount of costs for each applicable project that should be
excluded from Virginia Power’s rates. In October 2010, FERC issued an order dismissing the complaint in part and established hearings and settlement procedures on the remaining part of the complaint. In February 2012, Virginia Power
submitted to FERC a settlement agreement to resolve all issues set for hearing. All transmission customer parties to the proceeding joined the settlement. The Virginia Commission, North Carolina Commission and Public Staff of the North Carolina
Commission, while not parties to the settlement, have agreed to not oppose the settlement. If accepted by FERC, the settlement provides for payment by Virginia Power to the transmission customer parties of $250,000 per year for ten years and
resolves all matters other than the incremental cost of certain underground transmission facilities, which will be set for briefing. While Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the briefing, it is not expected to have a material effect
on results of operations.

PJM

For recovery of costs of investments of new PJM-planned transmission facilities that operate at or above 500 kV, FERC established a regional rate design
where all customers pay a uniform rate based on the costs of such investment. For recovery of costs of investment in new PJM-planned transmission facilities that operate below 500 kV, FERC affirmed its earlier decision to allocate costs on a
beneficiary pays approach. A notice of appeal of this decision was filed in February 2008 at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In August 2009, the court denied the petition for review concerning the rate design for existing
facilities, but granted the petition concerning the rate design for new facilities that operate at or above 500 kV, and remanded the issue of existing facilities back to FERC for further proceedings. Although Dominion and Virginia Power cannot
predict the outcome of the FERC proceedings on remand, the impact of any PJM rate design changes on the Companies’ results of operations is not expected to be material.

In May 2008, the RPM Buyers filed a complaint with FERC claiming that PJM’s Reliability Pricing Model’s transitional auctions have produced unjust and unreasonable capacity prices. The RPM
Buyers requested that a refund effective date of June 1, 2008 be established and that FERC provide appropriate relief from unjust and unreasonable capacity charges within 15 months. In September 2008, FERC dismissed the complaint. The RPM

Buyers requested rehearing of the FERC order in October 2008 and rehearing was denied in June 2009. A notice of appeal was filed in August 2009 by the Maryland Public Service Commission and the
New Jersey Board of Public Utilities at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In November 2009, the Court transferred the appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In February 2011, the Court of Appeals denied
the petition for review, concluding that FERC had adequately explained why the rates were just and reasonable.

In November
2011, PJM issued a formal notification that it would recalculate certain ancillary service revenues that had previously been paid during 2009, 2010 and 2011. Also in November 2011, PJM requested FERC permission to suspend its rebilling and
repayment obligations associated with the recalculation of such revenues and petitioned FERC to establish a proceeding to determine the appropriate recalculations for the revenues during this period. In December 2011, FERC permitted the
suspension of rebilling and repayment by PJM, subject to the outcome of FERC’s proceedings to determine the appropriate revenue recalculation. Virginia Power has accrued a liability of $36 million as of December 31, 2011 for estimated
future billing adjustments from PJM related to the ancillary service revenues.

FERC—Gas

FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy
Act of 1978, as amended. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over rates, terms and conditions of services performed by Dominion’s interstate natural gas company subsidiaries, including DTI, Cove Point and the Dominion South Pipeline
Company, LP. FERC also has jurisdiction over siting, construction and operation of natural gas import facilities and interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.

In December 2007, DTI and the IOGA entered into a settlement agreement on DTI’s gathering and processing rates, which DTI and IOGA agreed in May 2010 to extend through December 31, 2014. DTI, at
its option, may elect to extend the agreement for an additional year through December 31, 2015. The settlement extension maintains the gas retainage fee structure that DTI has had since 2001. The rates are 10.5% for gathering and 0.5% for
processing. Under the settlement, DTI continues to retain all revenues from its liquids sales, thus maintaining cash flow from the liquids business. In October 2011, DTI requested and received FERC approval of the negotiated rates associated with
the agreement extension.

In May 2011, Cove Point filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with proposed
rates to be effective July 1, 2011. Cove Point proposed an annual cost of service of approximately $150 million. In June 2011, FERC accepted a July 1, 2011 effective date for all proposed rates but two of which were suspended to be
effective December 1, 2011. In December 2011, Cove Point, FERC trial staff and the other active parties in the rate case reached a settlement in principle on all issues set for hearing by FERC, as well as on all outstanding proposed tariff
changes filed in May 2011. The parties expect to file the stipulation and agreement resolving all outstanding issues in the rate case in March 2012.

BLIGATIONS

AROs represent obligations that result from laws, statutes, contracts and regulations related to the eventual retirement of certain of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s long-lived assets.
Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s AROs are primarily associated with the decommissioning of their nuclear generation facilities. In addition, Dominion’s AROs include plugging and abandonment of gas and oil wells, interim retirements of
natural gas gathering, transmission, distribution and storage pipeline components, and the future abatement of asbestos expected to be disturbed in the Companies’ generation facilities.

The Companies have also identified, but not recognized, AROs related to retirement of Dominion’s LNG facility, Dominion’s gas
storage wells in its underground natural gas storage network, certain Virginia Power electric transmission and distribution assets located on property with easements, rights of way, franchises and lease agreements, Virginia Power’s
hydroelectric generation facilities and the abatement of certain asbestos not expected to be disturbed in the Companies’ generation facilities. The Companies currently do not have sufficient information to estimate a reasonable range of
expected retirement dates for any of these assets since the economic lives of these assets can be extended indefinitely through regular repair and maintenance and they currently have no plans to retire or dispose of any of these assets. As
a result, a settlement date is not determinable for these assets and AROs for these assets will not be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements until sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair
value of the activities to be performed. The Companies continue to monitor operational and strategic developments to identify if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate a retirement date for these assets. The changes to AROs during
2010 and 2011 were as follows:

(1)

Includes $9 million, $14 million and $15 million reported in other current liabilities at December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively.

(2)

Primarily reflects the effect of lower anticipated costs due to the expected future recovery from the DOE of certain spent fuel storage costs.

(3)

Includes $1 million, $3 million and $1 million reported in other current liabilities at December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

Dominion and Virginia Power have established trusts dedicated to funding the future decommissioning of their
nuclear plants. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the aggregate fair value of Dominion’s trusts, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities, totaled $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and
2010, the aggregate fair value of Virginia Power’s trusts, consisting primarily of debt and equity securities, totaled $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE and to disclose certain information about its significant variable interests in the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity
that has both 1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Virginia Power has long-term power and capacity contracts with four non-utility generators with an aggregate summer generation
capacity of approximately 870 MW. These contracts contain certain variable pricing mechanisms in the form of partial fuel reimbursement that Virginia Power considers to be variable interests. After an evaluation of the information provided by these
entities, Virginia Power was unable to determine whether they were VIEs. However, the information they provided, as well as Virginia Power’s knowledge of generation facilities in Virginia, enabled Virginia Power to conclude that, if they were
VIEs, it would not be the primary beneficiary. This conclusion reflects Virginia Power’s determination that its variable interests do not convey the power to direct the most significant activities that impact the economic performance of the
entities during the remaining terms of Virginia Power’s contracts and for the years the entities are expected to operate after its contractual relationships expire. The contracts expire at various dates ranging from 2015 to 2021. Virginia Power
is not subject to any risk of loss from these potential VIEs other than its remaining purchase commitments which totaled $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. Virginia Power paid $211 million, $213 million, and $210 million for electric
capacity and $125 million, $164 million, and $117 million for electric energy to these entities for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Virginia Power purchased shared services from DRS, an affiliated VIE, of approximately $389 million, $465 million, and $416 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Virginia Power determined that it is not the most closely associated entity with DRS and therefore not the primary beneficiary. DRS provides accounting, legal, finance and certain administrative and technical services to all Dominion subsidiaries,
including Virginia Power. Virginia Power has no obligation to absorb more than its allocated share of DRS costs.

Dominion
leases the Fairless generating facility in Pennsylvania from Juniper, the lessor, which began commercial operations in June 2004. Dominion makes annual lease payments of approximately $53 million. The lease expires in 2013 and, at that time,
Dominion may renew the lease on terms mutually agreeable to Dominion and Juniper based on original project costs and current



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

market conditions; purchase Fairless for approximately $923 million or sell Fairless, on behalf of Juniper, to an independent third party. If Fairless is sold and the proceeds from the sale are
less than its original construction cost, Dominion would be required to make a payment to the lessor in an amount up to 70.75% of the original project costs adjusted for certain other costs as specified in the lease. The lease agreement does not
contain any provisions that involve credit rating or stock price trigger events. Dominion expects to purchase Fairless when the lease expires in 2013.

Juniper was formed in 2003 as a limited partnership and was organized for the purpose of acquiring and constructing a number of assets for lease. Such assets were financed with proceeds from the issuance
of bank debt, privately placed long-term debt and partnership capital received from Juniper’s general and limited partners. Dominion has no voting equity interest in Juniper. Because Juniper had been subject to the business scope exception,
Dominion was not required to evaluate whether Juniper was a VIE prior to October 2011.

Through September 30, 2011,
Juniper held various power plant leases, including Fairless. In October 2011, the last lease other than Fairless expired and the related asset was sold by Juniper. With Fairless being its sole remaining asset, Juniper no longer qualified as a
business as of October 2011, which required that Dominion determine whether Juniper is a VIE. Dominion concluded Juniper is a VIE because the entity’s capitalization is insufficient to support its operations, the power to direct the most
significant activities of the entity are not performed by the equity holders, and Dominion, through its residual value guarantee discussed above, guarantees a portion of the residual value of Fairless. The activities that most significantly impact
Juniper’s economic performance relate to the operation of Fairless. The decisions related to the operations of Fairless are made by Dominion and as such, Dominion is considered the primary beneficiary.

Accordingly, Dominion consolidated Juniper in October 2011 and recorded, at fair value, approximately $957 million of property, plant and
equipment, $896 million of debt and $61 million of noncontrolling interests. The debt is non-recourse to Dominion and is secured by Juniper’s assets. The annual lease payments made by Dominion to Juniper for Fairless are now eliminated in the
Consolidated Statements of Income and are excluded from the lease commitments table in Note 23.

Dominion has not provided any
financial or other support to Juniper in the current period that it was not previously contractually required to provide.

by instrument holders, the scheduled principal payments of long-term debt at December 31, 2011, were as follows:

Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s short-term credit facilities and long-term debt agreements
contain customary covenants and default provisions. As of December 31, 2011, there were no events of default under these covenants.

In January 2012, Virginia Power issued $450 million of 2.95% senior notes that mature in
2022. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of short-term debt.

Convertible Securities

At December 31, 2011, Dominion had $143 million of outstanding contingent convertible senior notes that are convertible by holders into a
combination of cash and shares of Dominion’s common stock under certain circumstances. The conversion feature requires that the principal amount of each note be repaid in cash, while amounts payable in excess of the principal amount will be
paid in common stock. At issuance, the notes were valued at a conversion rate of 27.173 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of senior notes, which represented a conversion price of $36.80. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment
upon certain events such as subdivisions, splits, combinations of common stock or the issuance to all common stock holders of certain common stock rights, warrants or options and certain dividend increases. As of December 31, 2011, the
conversion rate had been adjusted to 28.9178 shares, primarily due to individual dividend payments above the level paid at issuance.

The number of shares included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation is calculated as the net shares issuable for the reporting period based upon the average market price for the period. This
results in an increase in the average shares outstanding used in the calculation of Dominion’s diluted EPS when the conversion price is lower than the average market price of Dominion’s common stock over the period, and results in no
adjustment when the conversion price exceeds the average market price.

The senior notes are convertible by holders into a
combination of cash and shares of Dominion’s common stock under any of the following circumstances:

(1)

The closing price of Dominion’s common stock equals 120% of the applicable conversion price or higher for at least 20 out of the last 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter;

(2)

The senior notes are called for redemption by Dominion;

(3)

The occurrence of specified corporate transactions; or

(4)

The credit rating assigned to the senior notes by Moody’s is below Baa3 and by Standard & Poor’s is below BBB- or the ratings are discontinued for
any reason.

The senior notes were not eligible for conversion during the first quarter of 2011. However, since
the closing price of Dominion’s common stock was equal to 120% of the applicable conversion price or higher for at least 20 out of the last 30 consecutive trading days of each quarter, the senior notes were eligible for conversion during each
of the last three quarters of 2011. During 2011, approximately $59 million of the contingent convertible senior notes were converted by holders. As of December 31, 2011, the closing price of Dominion’s common stock was equal to $41.50 per
share or higher for at least 20 out of the last 30 consecutive trading days; therefore, the senior notes are eligible for conversion during the first quarter of 2012. Beginning in 2007, the notes have been eligible for contingent interest if the
average trading price as defined in the indenture equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the senior notes. Holders have the right to require Dominion to purchase these senior notes for cash at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
interest in December 2013 or 2018, or if Dominion undergoes certain fundamental changes. The senior notes have been callable by Dominion since December 15, 2011.

Junior Subordinated Notes Payable to Affiliated Trusts

In previous years, Dominion established
several subsidiary capital trusts, each as a finance subsidiary of the respective parent company, which hold 100% of the voting interests. The trusts sold trust preferred securities representing preferred beneficial interests and 97% beneficial
ownership in the assets held by the trusts. In exchange for the funds realized from the sale of the trust preferred securities and common securities that represent the remaining 3% beneficial ownership interest in the assets held by the capital
trusts, Dominion issued various junior subordinated notes. The junior subordinated notes constitute 100% of each capital trust’s



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

assets. Each trust must redeem its trust preferred securities when their respective junior subordinated notes are repaid at maturity or if redeemed prior to maturity.

The following table provides summary information about the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes outstanding as of
December 31, 2011:

Junior subordinated notes/debentures held as assets by each capital trust were as follows:

(1)

$258 million—Dominion Resources, Inc. 7.83% Debentures due 12/1/2027.

(2)

$10 million—Dominion Resources, Inc. 8.4% Debentures due 1/15/2031.

Interest charges related to Dominion’s junior subordinated notes payable to affiliated trusts were $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Distribution payments on the trust preferred securities are considered to be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the respective parent
company that issued the debt instruments held by each trust when all of the related agreements are taken into consideration. Each guarantee agreement only provides for the guarantee of distribution payments on the relevant trust preferred securities
to the extent that the trust has funds legally and immediately available to make distributions. The trust’s ability to pay amounts when they are due on the trust preferred securities is dependent solely upon the payment of amounts by Dominion
when they are due on the junior subordinated notes. Dominion may defer interest payments on the junior subordinated notes on one or more occasions for up to five consecutive years and the related trusts must also defer distributions. If the payment
on the junior subordinated notes is deferred, Dominion may not make distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments, during the deferral period. Also, during any
deferral period, Dominion may not make any payments on, redeem or repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the junior subordinated notes.

Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes

In June 2006 and September 2006, Dominion issued $300 million of
June 2006 hybrids and $500 million of September 2006 hybrids, respectively. The June 2006 hybrids will bear interest at 7.5% per year until June 30, 2016. Thereafter, they will bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.825%, reset
quarterly. Beginning September 30, 2011, the September 2006 hybrids bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.3%, reset quarterly. Previously, interest was fixed at 6.3% per year.

In June 2009, Dominion issued $685 million (including $60 million related to the underwriter’s option to purchase additional notes to
cover over-allotments) of 8.375% June 2009 hybrids. The June 2009 hybrids are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DRU.

Dominion may defer interest payments on the hybrids on one or more occasions for up to 10
consecutive years. If the interest payments on the hybrids are deferred, Dominion may not make distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments during the deferral
period. Also, during the deferral period, Dominion may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the hybrids.

Dominion executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of all of the hybrids described above. Under the terms of the RCCs, Dominion
covenants to and for the benefit of designated covered debtholders, as may be designated from time to time, that Dominion shall not redeem, repurchase, or defease all or any part of the hybrids, and shall not cause its majority owned subsidiaries to
purchase all or any part of the hybrids, on or before their applicable RCC termination date, unless, subject to certain limitations, during the 180 days prior to such activity, Dominion has received a specified amount of proceeds as set forth in the
RCCs from the sale of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than the applicable characteristics of the hybrids at that time, as more fully described in the RCCs. In September 2011,
Dominion amended the RCCs of the June 2006 hybrids and September 2006 hybrids to expand the measurement period for consideration of proceeds from the sale of common stock issuances from 180 days to 365 days. The proceeds Dominion receives from the
replacement offering, adjusted by a predetermined factor, must equal or exceed the redemption or repurchase price.

In both
December 2011 and April 2010, Dominion purchased and cancelled $16 million of the September 2006 hybrids. These purchases were conducted in compliance with the RCC. In late February 2012, Dominion launched a tender offer to purchase up to $150
million of additional September 2006 hybrids, which amount may be increased or decreased at Dominion’s sole discretion. All purchases will be conducted in compliance with the RCC.

Goal-based stock awards are
granted to officers who have not achieved a certain targeted level of share ownership in lieu of cash-based performance grants. In 2008 and 2009, goal-based stock awards were also made to certain key non-officer employees. Current outstanding
goal-based shares include awards granted to officers in February 2010 and February 2011.

The issuance of awards is based on
the achievement of multiple performance metrics during a two-year period, including ROIC, BVP and TSR relative to that of a peer group of companies for 2009, and for 2010 and 2011 the two metrics of ROIC and TSR relative to that of a peer group of
companies. The actual number of shares issued will vary between zero and 200% of targeted shares depending on the level of performance metrics achieved. The fair value of goal-based stock is equal to the market price of Dominion’s stock on the
date of grant. Goal-based stock awards granted to key non-officer employees convert to restricted stock at the end of the two-year performance period and generally



vest three years from the original grant date. Awards to officers vest at the end of the two-year performance period. All goal-based stock awards are settled by issuing new shares.

After the performance period for the April 2008 grants ended on December 31, 2009, the CGN Committee determined the actual
performance against metrics established for those awards. For awards to key non-officer employees, 147 thousand shares of the outstanding goal-based stock awards granted in April 2008 were converted to 186 thousand shares of restricted
stock for the remaining term of the vesting period ending in April 2011. For awards to officers, 12 thousand shares of the outstanding goal-based stock awards were converted to 15 thousand non-restricted shares and issued to the officers.

After the performance period for the April 2009 grants ended on December 31, 2010, the CGN Committee determined the
actual performance against metrics established for those awards. For awards to key non-officer employees, 132 thousand shares of the outstanding goal-based stock awards granted in April 2009 were converted to 168 thousand shares of
restricted stock for the remaining term of the vesting period ending in April 2012. For awards to officers, 20 thousand shares of the outstanding goal-based stock awards were converted to 25 thousand non-restricted shares and issued to the
officers.

The following table provides a summary of goal-based stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2011,

Dominion provides certain benefits to eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. Under the terms of its benefit



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

plans, Dominion reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plans. From time to time in the past, benefits have changed, and some of these changes have reduced benefits.

Dominion maintains qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering virtually all employees. Retirement benefits are based
primarily on years of service, age and the employee’s compensation. Dominion’s funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with the provisions of ERISA. The pension program also provides benefits to certain
retired executives under a company-sponsored nonqualified employee benefit plan. The nonqualified plan is funded through contributions to a grantor trust.

Dominion provides retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits with annual employee premiums based on several factors such as age, retirement date and years of service. In January 2011, Dominion amended
its retiree healthcare and life benefits to change the eligibility age, effective January 1, 2012, for the majority of nonunion employees from 55 with 10 years of service to 58 with 10 years of service, resulting in an approximately $71 million
reduction to the other postretirement benefit plan obligation. The eligibility requirements for nonunion employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, who benefit under the Retiree Medical Account design, as well as for union employees are not
affected by this plan design change.

Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are affected by employee demographics
(including age, compensation levels and years of service), the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. These costs may also be affected by changes in key assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on plan
assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and the rate of compensation increases.

Dominion uses December 31 as
the measurement date for all of its employee benefit plans. Dominion uses the market-related value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets, a component of net periodic pension cost. The market-related value recognizes
changes in fair value on a straight-line basis over a four-year period, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Changes in fair value are measured as the difference between the expected and actual plan asset returns, including dividends, interest and
realized and unrealized investment gains and losses. Since the market-related value recognizes changes in fair value over a four-year period, the future market-related value of pension plan assets will be impacted as previously unrecognized changes
in fair value are recognized.

Dominion’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans hold investments in trusts to
fund employee benefit payments. Aggregate actual returns for Dominion’s pension and other postretirement plan assets were $273 million in 2011 and $624 million in 2010, versus expected returns of $519 million and $479 million, respectively.
Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the periodic cost recognized for such
employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans.

The Medicare Act introduced a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.

Dominion determined that the prescription drug benefit offered under its other postretirement benefit plans is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Dominion received a federal
subsidy of $5 million for each of 2011 and 2010. In December 2011, Dominion elected to change its method of receiving the subsidy under Medicare Part D for retiree prescription drug coverage from the Retiree Drug Subsidy to the EGWP. This change is
expected to be effective January 1, 2013. As a result of this change, Dominion recognized a decrease in its other postretirement benefit obligations of approximately $170 million as of December 31, 2011. This change is also expected to
reduce other postretirement benefit costs by approximately $20 million annually beginning in 2012.

Funded Status

The following table summarizes the changes in Dominion’s pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan obligations and plan
assets and includes a statement of the plans’ funded status:

Represents transfer of pension plan assets and obligation for all active Peoples employees as of February 1, 2010. See Note 4 for more information on the sale

The ABO for all of Dominion’s defined benefit pension plans was $4.5 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

Under its funding policies, Dominion evaluates plan funding requirements annually, usually in the fourth quarter
after receiving updated plan information from its actuary. Based on the funded status of each plan and other factors, Dominion determines the amount of contributions for the current year, if any, at that time. During 2011, Dominion made no
contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans and no contributions are currently expected in 2012. Certain regulatory authorities have held that amounts recovered in utility customers’ rates for other postretirement benefits, in
excess of benefits actually paid during the year, must be deposited in trust funds dedicated for the sole purpose of paying such benefits. Accordingly, certain of Dominion’s subsidiaries fund other postretirement benefit costs through VEBAs.
Dominion’s remaining subsidiaries do not prefund other postretirement benefit costs but instead pay claims as presented. Dominion expects to contribute approximately $16 million to the Dominion VEBAs in 2012.

Dominion does not expect any pension or other postretirement plan assets to be returned to the Company during 2012.

The following table provides information on the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for plans with a benefit obligation in
excess of plan assets:

The increase primarily reflects a decrease in the discount rate as of December 31, 2011.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are

The above benefit payments for other postretirement benefit plans for 2012 are expected to be offset by a
Medicare Part D subsidy of approximately $5 million. As a result of the adoption of the EGWP as discussed above, beginning in 2013 Dominion will receive an increased level of Medicare Part D subsidies, in the form of reduced costs rather than a
direct reimbursement.

Plan Assets

Dominion’s overall objective for investing its pension and other postretirement plan assets is to achieve the best possible long-term rates of return commensurate with prudent levels of risk. To
minimize risk, funds are broadly diversified among asset classes, investment strategies and investment advisors. The strategic target asset allocations for its pension funds are 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 33% fixed income, 3% real estate
and 18% other alternative investments. U.S. equity includes investments in large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap companies located in the United States. Non-U.S. equity includes investments in large-cap companies located outside of the United States
including both developed and emerging markets. Fixed income includes corporate debt instruments of companies from diversified industries and U.S. Treasuries. The U.S. equity, non-U.S. equity and fixed income investments are in individual securities
as well as mutual funds. Real estate includes equity REITs and investments in partnerships. Other alternative investments include partnership investments in private equity, debt and hedge funds that follow several different strategies.

Strategic investment policies are established for Dominion’s prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies.
Factors considered in setting the investment policy include employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the
plans’ strategic allocation are a function of Dominion’s assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans’ actual asset allocations
varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other
postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns. Financial derivatives may be used to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities.

As of December 31, 2011, of the $2.2 billion related to pension benefits, $1.4 billion is included in AOCI, with the remainder included in regulatory assets and
liabilities; the $14 million related to other postretirement benefits consists of $16 million included in regulatory assets and liabilities and $(2) million included in AOCI. As of December 31, 2010, of the $1.8 billion and $240 million related to
pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, $978 million and $75 million, respectively, are included in AOCI, with the remainder included in regulatory assets and liabilities.

Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for its pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:

•

Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions;

•

Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes;

•

Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations;

•

Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indices; and

•

Investment allocation of plan assets.

Dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of other independent investment advisors to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions.

Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its
plans.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for Dominion’s retiree
healthcare plans. A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects:

Defined Contribution Plans

In addition, Dominion sponsors defined contribution employee savings plans. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, Dominion recognized $38 million, $39 million and $42 million, respectively, as contributions to
these plans.

Virginia Power participates in the Dominion Pension Plan, a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by Dominion that provides benefits to multiple Dominion subsidiaries. Retirement benefits payable under
this plan are based primarily on years of service, age and the employee’s compensation. As a participating employer, Virginia Power is subject to Dominion’s funding policy, which is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance
with the provisions of ERISA. During 2011, Virginia Power made no contributions to the plan and no contributions are currently expected in 2012. Virginia Power’s net periodic pension cost related to this pension plan was $50 million, $84
million and $48 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2010 net periodic pension cost includes the impact of a settlement and curtailment as well as a one-time special termination benefit for certain employees in connection with a
workforce reduction program. Employee compensation is the basis for determining Virginia Power’s share of total pension costs.

Virginia Power also participates in the Dominion Retiree Health and Welfare Plan, a plan sponsored by Dominion that provides certain retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits to multiple Dominion
subsidiaries. Annual employee premiums are based on several factors such as age, retirement date and years of service. Virginia Power’s net periodic benefit cost related to this plan was $23 million, $59 million and $55 million in 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively. Employee headcount is the basis for determining Virginia Power’s share of total other postretirement benefit costs.

Certain regulatory authorities have held that amounts recovered in rates for other postretirement benefits, in excess of benefits actually paid during the year, must be deposited in trust funds dedicated
for the sole purpose of paying such benefits. Accordingly, Virginia Power funds other postretirement benefit costs through a VEBA. Virginia Power’s contributions to the VEBA were $35 million and $34 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Virginia Power made no contributions to the VEBA in 2011 and does not expect to contribute to the VEBA in 2012.

Dominion holds
investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, in which Virginia Power’s employees participate. Any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in
the periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash that Virginia Power will provide to Dominion for its share of employee benefit plan contributions.

Virginia Power also participates in Dominion-sponsored defined contribution employee savings plans that cover substantially all employees.
Employer matching contributions of $14 million were incurred in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009.

ONTINGENCIES

As a result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, Dominion and Virginia Power are involved in legal proceedings before various courts
and are periodically subject to governmental examinations (including by regulatory authorities), inquiries and investigations. Certain legal proceedings and governmental examinations involve demands for unspecified amounts of damages, are in an
initial procedural phase, involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, such that it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For
such matters that the Companies cannot estimate, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the litigation or investigative processes such that the Companies are able
to estimate a range of possible loss. For legal proceedings and governmental examinations for which the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued
liability (if any) for such matters. Estimated ranges of loss are inclusive of legal fees and net of any anticipated insurance recoveries. This estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and
significant uncertainties. This estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Companies’ maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such legal proceedings and governmental examinations will change from time to time and
actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current proceedings not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on
Dominion’s or Virginia Power’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Environmental Matters

Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health
and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.

On
December 21, 2011, the EPA issued MATS for coal and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. The rule establishes strict emission limits for mercury, particulate matter as a surrogate for toxic metals and hydrogen chloride as a
surrogate for acid gases. The rule includes a limited use provision for oil-fired units with annual capacity factors under 8% that provides an exemption from emission limits, and allows compliance with operational work practice standards. Compliance
will be required by Spring 2015, with certain limited exceptions. In December 2011, Virginia Power recorded a $228 million ($139 million after-tax) charge reflecting plant balances that are not expected to be recovered in future periods due to the
anticipated retirement of certain regulated coal units, primarily as a result of the issuance of the final MATS. Dominion continues to be governed by individual state mercury emission reduction regulations in Massachusetts and Illinois that are
largely unaffected by this rule.

In July 2011, the EPA issued a final replacement rule for CAIR, called
CSAPR, that requires 28 states to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines. CSAPR establishes new SO


and NO

x

emissions cap and trade programs that are completely independent of the current ARP. Specifically, CSAPR requires reductions in SO


and NO

x

emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units of 25 MW or more through annual NO

x

emissions caps, NO

x

emissions caps during the ozone season (May 1 through September 30)
and annual SO


emission caps with differing requirements for
two groups of affected states.

Prior to the issuance of CSAPR, Dominion and Virginia Power held $57
million and $43 million, respectively, of SO


emissions
allowances obtained for ARP and CAIR compliance. Due to CSAPR’s establishment of a new allowance program and the elimination of CAIR, Dominion and Virginia Power have more SO


emissions allowances than needed for ARP compliance, which resulted in the impairment of these allowances in the third
quarter of 2011. See Note 7 for further details of the impairments.

With respect to Dominion’s generation fleet, the cost
to comply with the rule is not expected to be material. However, following numerous petitions for review and motions for stay, in December 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling to stay CSAPR pending judicial
review. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2011, the EPA proposed technical revisions to CSAPR. Accordingly, future outcomes of litigation and/or final action to modify the rule could affect this assessment. While the stay of CSAPR is in
effect, the EPA will continue to administer CAIR.

The CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory
tools to protect and preserve the nation’s air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more
restrictive. Many of Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s facilities are subject to the CAA’s permitting and other requirements.

In February 2008, Dominion received a request for information pursuant to Section 114 of the CAA from the EPA. The request concerns historical operating changes and capital improvements undertaken at
State Line and Kincaid. In April 2009, Dominion received a second request for information. Dominion provided information in response to both requests. Also in April 2009, Dominion received a Notice and Finding of Violations from the EPA claiming
violations of the CAA New Source Review requirements, New Source Performance Standards, the Title V permit program and the stations’ respective State Implementation Plans. The Notice states that the EPA may issue an order requiring compliance
with the relevant CAA provisions and may seek injunctive relief and/or civil penalties, all pursuant to the EPA’s enforcement authority under the CAA.

Dominion believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The CAA authorizes maximum civil penalties of
$25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. In addition to any such penalties that may be awarded, an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures or affect the
timing of currently budgeted capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time. Such expenditures could affect future

results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Dominion is currently unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts related to these matters.

In June 2010, the Conservation Law Foundation and Healthlink Inc. filed a Complaint in the District Court of Massachusetts against
Dominion Energy New England, Inc. alleging that Salem Harbor units 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been and are in violation of visible emissions standards and monitoring requirements of the Massachusetts State Implementation Plan and the station’s state
and federal operating permits. In February 2012, the court entered a consent decree among the parties, pursuant to which Dominion will retire Salem Harbor. The consent decree is not expected to have a material effect on Dominion’s operations,
financial statements or cash flows.

The CWA is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms.
Dominion and Virginia Power must comply with all aspects of the CWA programs at their operating facilities.

In October 2003,
the EPA and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection each issued new NPDES permits for Brayton Point. The new permits contained identical conditions that in effect require the installation of cooling towers to address concerns over
the withdrawal and discharge of cooling water. Currently, Dominion is constructing the cooling towers and estimates the total cost to install these cooling towers at approximately $570 million, with remaining expenditures of approximately $65
million included in its planned capital expenditures through 2012.

In October 2007, the VSWCB issued a renewed VPDES permit
for North Anna. BREDL, and other persons, appealed the VSWCB’s decision to the Richmond Circuit Court, challenging several permit provisions related to North Anna’s discharge of cooling water. In February 2009, the court ruled that the
VSWCB was required to regulate the thermal discharge from North Anna into the waste heat treatment facility. Virginia Power filed a motion for reconsideration with the court in February 2009, which was denied. The final order was issued by the court
in September 2009. The court’s order allowed North Anna to continue to operate pursuant to the currently issued VPDES permit. In October 2009, Virginia Power filed a Notice of Appeal of the court’s order with the Richmond Circuit Court,
initiating the appeals process to the Virginia Court of Appeals. In June 2010, the Virginia Court of Appeals reversed the Richmond Circuit Court’s September 2009 order. The Virginia Court of Appeals held that the lower court had applied the
wrong standard of review, and that the VSWCB’s determination not to regulate the station’s thermal discharge into the waste heat treatment facility was lawful. In July 2010, BREDL and the other original appellants filed a petition for
appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia requesting that it review the Court of Appeals’ decision. In December 2010, the Supreme Court of Virginia granted BREDL’s petition. In January 2012, the Supreme Court of Virginia upheld the
Virginia Court of Appeals’ June 2010 ruling for Dominion and the VSWCB.

In September 2010, Millstone’s NPDES permit
was reissued under the CWA. The conditions of the permit require an
evalua-

tion of control technologies that could result in additional expenditures in the future, however, Dominion cannot currently predict the outcome of this evaluation. In October 2010, the permit
issuance was appealed to the state court by a private plaintiff. The permit is expected to remain in effect during the appeal. Dominion is currently unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts related to this matter.

The CERCLA, as amended, provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous
substances into the environment and authorizes the U.S. government either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under the
CERCLA, as amended, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of contaminated sites, can be strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup. These potentially responsible
parties can be ordered to perform a cleanup, be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, voluntarily settle with the U.S. government concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or voluntarily begin a site investigation and site
remediation under state oversight.

From time to time, Dominion or Virginia Power may be identified as a potentially
responsible party to a Superfund site. The EPA (or a state) can either allow such a party to conduct and pay for a remedial investigation, feasibility study and remedial action or conduct the remedial investigation and action itself and then seek
reimbursement from the potentially responsible parties. Each party can be held jointly, severally and strictly liable for the cleanup costs. These parties can also bring contribution actions against each other and seek reimbursement from their
insurance companies. As a result, Dominion or Virginia Power may be responsible for the costs of remedial investigation and actions under the Superfund law or other laws or regulations regarding the remediation of waste. Except as noted below, the
Companies do not believe this will have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

In
September 2011, the EPA issued a UAO to Virginia Power and 22 other parties, ordering specific remedial action of certain areas at the Ward Transformer Superfund site located in Raleigh, North Carolina. Virginia Power does not believe it is a
liable party under CERCLA based on its alleged connection to the site. In November 2011 Virginia Power and a number of other parties notified the EPA that they are declining to undertake the work set forth in the UAO.

The EPA may seek to enforce a UAO in court pursuant to its enforcement authority under CERCLA, and may seek recovery of its costs in
undertaking removal or remedial action. If the court determines that a respondent failed to comply with the UAO without sufficient cause, the EPA may also seek civil penalties of up to $37,500 per day for the violation and punitive damages of
up to three times the costs incurred by the EPA as a result of the party’s failure to comply with the UAO. Virginia Power is currently unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts related to the Ward Transformer
matter.

Dominion has determined that it is associated with 17 former manufactured gas plant sites. Studies conducted by other
utilities



at their former manufactured gas plant sites have indicated that those sites contain coal tar and other potentially harmful materials. None of the 17 former sites with which Dominion is
associated is under investigation by any state or federal environmental agency. At one of the former sites, Dominion is conducting a state-approved post closure groundwater monitoring program and an environmental land use restriction has been
recorded. Another site has been accepted into a state-based voluntary remediation program and Dominion has not yet estimated the future remediation costs. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these sites, Dominion is unable to make an estimate of the
potential financial statement impacts related to these sites.

EGISLATION

EGULATION

Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, among other states, have
joined RGGI, a multi-state effort to reduce CO


emissions in
the Northeast implemented through state specific regulations. Under the initiative, aggregate CO


emissions from power plants in participating states are required to be stabilized at current levels from 2009 to 2015. Further reductions from current levels would be required to be phased in starting in
2016 such that by 2019 there would be a 10% reduction in participating state power plant CO


emissions. During 2012, RGGI will undergo a program review which could impact regulations and implementation of RGGI. The impact of this program review on Dominion’s fossil fired generation
operations in RGGI states is unknown at this time. Dominion is currently unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts related to these matters.

Three of Dominion’s facilities, Brayton Point, Salem Harbor and Manchester Street, are subject to RGGI. Beginning
with calendar year 2009, RGGI requires that Dominion cover each ton of CO


direct stack emissions from these facilities with either an allowance or an offset. The allowances can be purchased through auction or through a secondary market. Dominion has participated in RGGI
allowance auctions to date and has procured allowances to meet its estimated compliance requirements under RGGI for 2009 through 2013 and partially for 2014, therefore Dominion does not expect compliance with RGGI to have a material impact on its
results of operations or financial condition. However, during June 2011, a lawsuit was filed in New York seeking to retroactively rescind RGGI participation by that state. Currently, a percentage of Dominion’s RGGI allowances have
been acquired from New York. The allocated value of these allowances totaled approximately $38 million, of which the majority have been expensed as consumed. Dominion anticipates that it will surrender New York RGGI allowances for purposes of
compliance prior to the issuance of a court decision in the lawsuit, should Dominion continue to hold New York allowances at such time that the court issues a decision that is adverse to New York, and RGGI does not exchange these allowances for
other state allowances, replacement allowances would have to be purchased. Dominion cannot predict the outcome of the case and is currently unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts related to these matters.

Long-Term Purchase Agreements

At December 31, 2011, Virginia Power had the following long-term commitments that are noncancelable or are cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure

Commitments represent estimated amounts payable for capacity under power purchase contracts with qualifying facilities and independent power producers, the last of
which ends in 2021. Capacity payments under the contracts are generally based on fixed dollar amounts per month, subject to escalation using broad-based economic indices. At December 31, 2011, the present value of Virginia Power’s
total commitment for capacity payments is $1.7 billion. Capacity payments totaled $338 million, $344 million, and $356 million, and energy payments totaled $275 million, $303 million, and $254 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Lease Commitments

Dominion and Virginia Power lease various facilities, vehicles and equipment primarily under operating leases. Payments under certain leases are escalated
based on an index such as the consumer price index. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and capital leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2011 are as follows:

Rental expense for Dominion totaled $155 million, $171 million, and $172 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Rental expense for Virginia Power totaled $50 million, $50 million, and $49 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The majority of rental expense is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense.

SSURANCE

The NRC requires nuclear
power plant owners to annually update minimum financial assurance amounts for the future decommissioning of their nuclear facilities. Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station
once operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. The 2011 calculation for the NRC minimum financial assurance amount, aggregated for Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear units, was $3.2 billion and $1.8
billion, respectively, and has been satisfied by a combination of the funds being collected and deposited in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the real annual rate of return growth of the funds allowed by the NRC. The 2011 NRC minimum financial
assurance amounts shown were calculated using preliminary December 31, 2011 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indices. Dominion believes that the



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

amounts currently available in its decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone and Kewaunee units. Virginia
Power also believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if
such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns as the units will not be decommissioned for decades. Dominion and Virginia Power will continue to monitor these
trusts to ensure they meet the minimum financial assurance requirement, which may include the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial guarantees recognized by the NRC.

NSURANCE

The Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 provides the public up to $12.6 billion of liability protection per nuclear incident, via obligations required of owners of nuclear power plants, and allows for
an inflationary provision adjustment every five years. Dominion and Virginia Power have purchased $375 million of coverage from commercial insurance pools for each reactor site with the remainder provided through a mandatory industry risk-sharing
program. In the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear reactor in the U.S., the Companies could be assessed up to $118 million for each of their licensed reactors not to exceed $18 million per year per reactor. There is no limit to the
number of incidents for which this retrospective premium can be assessed.

The current level of property insurance coverage for
Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s nuclear units is as follows:

(1)

Surry and North Anna share a blanket property limit of $1 billion.

The Companies’ coverage exceeds the NRC minimum requirement for nuclear power plant licensees of $1.06 billion per reactor site and includes coverage for premature decommissioning and functional
total loss. The NRC requires that the proceeds from this insurance be used first, to return the reactor to and maintain it in a safe and stable condition and second, to decontaminate the reactor and station site in accordance with a plan approved by
the NRC. Nuclear property insurance is provided by NEIL, a mutual insurance company, and is subject to retrospective premium assessments in any policy year in which losses exceed the funds available to the insurance company. Dominion’s and
Virginia Power’s maximum retrospective premium assessment for the current policy period is $78 million and $40 million, respectively. Based on the severity of the incident, the Board of Directors of the nuclear insurer has the discretion to
lower or eliminate the maximum retrospective premium assessment. Dominion and Virginia Power have the financial responsibility for any losses that exceed the limits or for which insurance
pro-

ceeds are not available because they must first be used for stabilization and decontamination.

Dominion and Virginia Power also purchase insurance from NEIL to mitigate certain expenses, including replacement power costs, associated with the prolonged outage of a nuclear unit due to direct physical
damage. Under this program, the Companies are subject to a retrospective premium assessment for any policy year in which losses exceed funds available to NEIL. Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s maximum retrospective premium assessment for
the current policy period is $31 million and $19 million, respectively.

ODEC, a part owner of North Anna, and Massachusetts
Municipal Wholesale Electric Company and Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, part owners of Millstone’s Unit 3, are responsible to Dominion and Virginia Power for their share of the nuclear decommissioning obligation and insurance
premiums on applicable units, including any retrospective premium assessments and any losses not covered by insurance.

Under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Dominion and Virginia Power entered
into contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin accepting the spent fuel on January 31, 1998, the date provided by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and by the Companies’ contracts with the DOE. In
January 2004, Dominion and Virginia Power filed lawsuits in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the DOE requesting damages in connection with its failure to commence accepting spent nuclear fuel. In October 2008, the court issued an
opinion and order for Dominion in the amount of approximately $155 million, which includes approximately $112 million in damages incurred by Virginia Power for spent fuel-related costs at Surry and North Anna and approximately $43 million in damages
incurred for spent nuclear fuel-related costs at Millstone through June 30, 2006. In December 2008, the government appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The government’s initial brief in the appeal was
filed in June 2010. The issues raised by the government on appeal pertained to the damages awarded to Dominion for Millstone. The government did not take issue with the damages awarded to Virginia Power for Surry or North Anna. As a result, Virginia
Power recognized a receivable in the amount of $174 million, largely offset against property, plant and equipment and regulatory assets and liabilities, representing certain spent nuclear fuel-related costs incurred through June 30, 2010.

In the second quarter of 2011, the Federal Appeals Court issued a decision affirming the trial court’s damages award. The
government did not seek rehearing of the Federal Appeals Court decision or seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result, Dominion recognized a receivable in the amount of $64 million for certain Millstone spent nuclear fuel-related costs
incurred through June 30, 2011 that were considered probable of recovery. Dominion recognized a pre-tax benefit of $24 million, with $17 million recorded in other operations and maintenance expense and $7 million recorded in depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense during 2011, with the remainder largely offset against property, plant and equipment. Dominion received payment of the $155 million damages award, including $112 million of damages incurred by Virginia Power,
during the third quarter of 2011.



A lawsuit was also filed for Kewaunee. In August 2010, Dominion and the federal government
reached a settlement resolving Dominion’s claims for damages incurred at Kewaunee through December 31, 2008. The approximately $21 million settlement payment was received in September 2010.

The Companies continue to recognize receivables for certain spent nuclear fuel-related costs that they believe are probable of recovery
from the DOE. At December 31, 2011, Dominion’s and Virginia Power’s receivables for spent nuclear fuel-related costs totaled $102 million and $76 million, respectively. The Companies will continue to manage their spent fuel until it
is accepted by the DOE.

Guarantees, Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit

D

OMINION

At December 31, 2011, Dominion had issued $82 million of
guarantees, primarily to support equity method investees. No significant amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded. As of December 31, 2011, Dominion’s exposure under these guarantees was $49 million, primarily
related to certain reserve requirements associated with non-recourse financing.

In addition to the above guarantees, Dominion
and its partners, Shell and BP, may be required to make additional periodic equity contributions to NedPower and Fowler Ridge in connection with certain funding requirements associated with their respective non-recourse financings. As of
December 31, 2011, Dominion’s maximum remaining cumulative exposure under these equity funding agreements is $123 million through 2019 and its maximum annual future contributions could range from approximately $4 million to $19 million.

Dominion also enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries, primarily to facilitate their
commercial transactions with third parties. To the extent that a liability subject to a guarantee has been incurred by one of Dominion’s consolidated subsidiaries, that liability is included in Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion is not
required to recognize liabilities for guarantees issued on behalf of its subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that it will have to perform under the guarantees. Terms of the guarantees typically end once obligations have been paid. Dominion
currently believes it is unlikely that it would be required to perform or otherwise incur any losses associated with guarantees of its subsidiaries’ obligations.

At December 31, 2011, Dominion had issued the following subsidiary guarantees:

(1)

Represents the estimated portion of the guarantee’s stated limit that is utilized as of December 31, 2011 based upon prevailing economic conditions
and fact patterns specific to each guarantee arrangement. For those guarantees related to obligations that are recorded as liabilities by Dominion’s subsidiaries, the value includes the recorded amount.

(2)

Guarantees of debt of certain DEI subsidiaries. In the event of default by the subsidiaries, Dominion would be obligated to repay such amounts.

(3)

Guarantees related to energy trading and marketing activities and other commodity commitments of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiaries of Virginia Power and
DEI. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, oil, electricity, pipeline capacity, transportation and related commodities and services. If any of these subsidiaries fail to
perform or pay under the contracts and the counterparties seek performance or payment, Dominion would be obligated to satisfy such obligation. Dominion and its subsidiaries receive similar guarantees as collateral for credit extended to others. The
value provided includes certain guarantees that do not have stated limits.

(4)

Guarantees related to certain DEI subsidiaries’ potential retrospective premiums that could be assessed if there is a nuclear incident under Dominion’s
nuclear insurance programs and guarantees for a DEI subsidiary’s and Virginia Power’s commitment to buy nuclear fuel. Excludes Dominion’s agreement to provide up to $150 million and $60 million to two DEI subsidiaries to pay the
operating expenses of Millstone and Kewaunee, respectively, in the event of a prolonged outage, as part of satisfying certain NRC requirements concerned with ensuring adequate funding for the operations of nuclear power stations.

(5)

Guarantees related to other miscellaneous contractual obligations such as leases, environmental obligations and construction projects. Also includes guarantees
related to certain DEI subsidiaries’ obligations for equity capital contributions and energy generation associated with Fowler Ridge and NedPower.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2011 Dominion had purchased $151 million of surety bonds and authorized the issuance of letters of credit by financial institutions of $36 million to facilitate
commercial transactions by its subsidiaries with third parties. Under the terms of surety bonds, Dominion is obligated to indemnify the respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.

respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.

Indemnifications

As part of commercial contract negotiations in the normal course of business, Dominion and Virginia Power may sometimes agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may involve an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretation of the tax law. Dominion and
Virginia Power are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts because events that would obligate them have not yet occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified
of its occurrence. However, at December 31, 2011,

Dominion and Virginia Power believe future payments, if any, that could ultimately
become payable under these contract provisions, would not have a material impact on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Workforce Reduction Program

In the first quarter of 2010, Dominion and Virginia Power announced a workforce reduction program that reduced their total workforces by approximately 9% and 11%, respectively, during 2010. The goal of
the workforce reduction program was to reduce operations and maintenance expense growth and further improve the efficiency of the Companies. In the first quarter of 2010, Dominion recorded a $338 million ($206 million after-tax) charge, including
$202 million ($123 million after-tax) at Virginia Power, primarily reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Income due to severance pay and other benefits related to the workforce reduction program.
During 2010, Dominion and Virginia Power paid $109 million and $104 million, respectively, of costs related to the program. The terms of the workforce reduction program were consistent with the Companies’ existing severance plan.

Merchant Generation Operations

Dominion
continually reviews its portfolio of assets to determine which assets fit strategically and support its objectives to improve return on invested capital and shareholder value. If Dominion identifies assets that do not support its objectives and
believes they may be of greater value to another owner, Dominion may consider such assets for divestiture. In connection with this effort, in the first quarter of 2011, Dominion decided to pursue the sale of Kewaunee. If these efforts are
successful, Dominion may be required to present Kewaunee’s assets and liabilities that are subject to sale as held for sale in its Consolidated Balance Sheet and Kewaunee’s results of operations in discontinued operations in its
Consolidated Statements of Income. Held for sale classification would require that amounts be recorded at the lower of book value or sale price less costs to sell and could result in the recording of an impairment charge. Any sale of Kewaunee would
be subject to the approval of Dominion’s Board of Directors, as well as applicable state and federal approvals.

During
the second quarter of 2011, Dominion announced that State Line would be retired by mid-2014, and that it would retire two of the four units at Salem Harbor by the end of 2011 and plans to retire the remaining units on June 1, 2014. In the
second quarter of 2011, Dominion recorded a $17 million ($11 million after-tax) charge in other operations and maintenance expense for severance costs related to the expected closings of these merchant generation facilities. In August 2011, Dominion
announced that State Line would be retired in the first quarter of 2012, given a continued decline in power prices and the expected cost to comply with CSAPR. During the third quarter of 2011, Dominion recorded a $15 million ($10 million after-tax)
charge in other operations and maintenance expense related to the accelerated closure of State Line.

MF Global

Prior to October 31, 2011, certain of Dominion’s subsidiaries executed certain commodity transactions on exchanges using MF Global, an FCM registered
with the CFTC. In order to secure its potential exposure on these commodity transactions, Dominion posted certain required margin collateral with MF Global. The parent company of MF Global, MF Global Holdings Ltd., filed for bankruptcy relief under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on October 31, 2011. On the same date, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York appointed a trustee to oversee the liquidation of MF Global pursuant to the Securities Investor Protection
Act.

In accordance with court-approved procedures, Dominion transferred to other FCMs all open
positions executed using MF Global. The initial margin posted for these open positions at October 31, 2011 was approximately $73 million. Dominion has received approximately $8 million of this amount through the liquidation process to date.

At this time, the MF Global trustee is determining the final amounts that will be recoverable and ultimately distributed to MF
Global’s customers. As part of this process, the trustee has filed claims in the insolvency proceeding of MF Global affiliates in various foreign jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, which claims are still pending. Due to the
uncertainty surrounding the ultimate recovery on the claims filed by the MF Global trustee in the United Kingdom and elsewhere and the potential dilution of such recovered funds in the liquidation process, Dominion is unable to estimate the loss, if
any, associated with its remaining margin claims.

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if counterparties fail to perform their contractual obligations. In order to minimize overall credit risk, credit policies are maintained, including the
evaluation of counterparty financial condition, collateral requirements and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition, counterparties may make available
collateral, including letters of credit or cash held as margin deposits, as a result of exceeding agreed-upon credit limits, or may be required to prepay the transaction.

Dominion and Virginia Power maintain a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of their customers, historical trends and other information. Management believes, based on
credit policies and the December 31, 2011 provision for credit losses, that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

OMINION

As a diversified energy
company, Dominion transacts primarily with major companies in the energy industry and with commercial and residential energy consumers. These transactions principally occur in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S. Dominion does
not believe that this geographic concentration contributes significantly to its overall exposure to credit risk. In addition, as a result of its large and diverse customer base, Dominion is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk
for receivables arising from electric and gas utility operations.

Dominion’s exposure to credit risk is concentrated
primarily within its energy marketing and price risk management activities, as Dominion transacts with a smaller, less diverse group of counterparties and transactions may involve large notional volumes and potentially volatile commodity prices.
Energy marketing and price risk management activities include trading of energy-related commodities, marketing of merchant generation output, structured transactions and the use of financial contracts for enterprise-wide hedging purposes. Gross
credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account



contractual netting rights. Gross credit exposure is calculated prior to the application of collateral. At December 31, 2011, Dominion’s gross credit exposure totaled $534 million.
After the application of collateral, credit exposure is reduced to $504 million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those internally rated, represented 80%. One counterparty exposure represents 10% of Dominion’s total
exposure and is a large financial institution rated investment grade.

Virginia Power sells electricity and provides distribution and transmission services to customers in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Management
believes that this geographic concentration risk is mitigated by the diversity of Virginia Power’s customer base, which includes residential, commercial and industrial customers, as well as rural electric cooperatives and municipalities. Credit
risk associated with trade accounts receivable from energy consumers is limited due to the large number of customers. Virginia Power’s exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from sales to wholesale customers.
Virginia Power’s gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross credit exposure is calculated

ROVISIONS

The majority of Dominion’s derivative instruments contain credit-related contingent provisions. These provisions require Dominion to provide collateral upon the occurrence of specific events,
primarily a credit downgrade. If the credit-related contingent features underlying these instruments that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash were fully triggered as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Dominion would
have been required to post an additional $88 million of collateral to its counterparties. The collateral that would be required to be posted includes the impacts of any offsetting asset positions and any amounts already posted for derivatives,
non-derivative contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. Dominion had posted $110 million in collateral, including $4 million of letters of credit at December 31, 2011 and
$54 million in collateral, including $19 million of letters of credit at December 31, 2010, related to derivatives with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash. The collateral
posted includes any amounts paid related to non-derivative contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-related
contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $259 million and $210 million, respectively, which does not include the impact of any offsetting asset positions.
Credit-related contingent provisions for Virginia Power were not material as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. See Note 8 for further information about derivative instruments.

RANSACTIONS

Virginia Power engages in related-party transactions primarily with other Dominion subsidiaries (affiliates). Virginia Power’s receivable and payable balances with affiliates are settled based on
contractual terms or on a monthly basis, depending on the nature of the underlying transactions. Virginia Power is included in Dominion’s consolidated federal income tax return and participates in certain Dominion benefit plans. A discussion of
significant related-party transactions follows.

Transactions with Affiliates

Virginia Power transacts with affiliates for certain quantities of natural gas and other commodities in the ordinary course of business. Virginia Power also enters into certain commodity derivative
contracts with affiliates. Virginia Power uses these contracts, which are principally comprised of commodity swaps and options, to manage commodity price risks associated with purchases of natural gas.

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Virginia Power’s derivative liabilities with affiliates were not material.

DRS and other affiliates provide accounting, legal, finance and certain administrative and technical services to Virginia Power. In
addition, Virginia Power provides certain services to affiliates, including charges for facilities and equipment usage. Presented below are significant transactions with DRS and other affiliates:

In the fourth quarter of 2011, a subsidiary of Virginia Power purchased nuclear fuel-related inventory
from an affiliate for $39 million for future use at its nuclear generation stations.

The following table presents Virginia
Power’s borrowings from Dominion under short-term arrangements:

Virginia Power’s interest charges related to its borrowings from Dominion were immaterial for the

Management of Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) understands and accepts responsibility for Dominion’s financial statements and related disclosures and the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting (internal control). Dominion continuously strives to identify opportunities to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control, just as Dominion does throughout all aspects of its business.

Dominion maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that its assets are
safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with established procedures. This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to ensure
appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and internal audits.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Dominion, composed entirely of independent
directors, meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to discuss auditing, internal control, and financial reporting matters of Dominion and to ensure that each is properly
discharging its responsibilities. Both the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit Committee and have free access to the Committee at any time.

SEC rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require Dominion’s 2011 Annual Report to contain a
management’s report and a report of the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of internal control. As a basis for the report, Dominion tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal
controls. Based on its assessment as of December 31, 2011, Dominion makes the following assertion:

Management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting of Dominion.

There are
inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

Management evaluated Dominion’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, Management believes that Dominion maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.

Richmond, Virginia

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Dominion Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Dominion”) as of
December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Dominion’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Dominion’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
Board of Directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Dominion maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2011 of Dominion and our report dated February 27, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

NTRODUCTION

Virginia Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion. Virginia Power’s Board is comprised of Messrs. Farrell, McGettrick and Rogers. As executive officers of Virginia Power, Messrs. Farrell and
McGettrick are not independent. Mr. Rogers is not considered to be independent because he is an officer of Dominion. Because Virginia Power’s Board is not independent, there is not a separate compensation committee at the Virginia Power
level. Instead, Virginia Power’s Board depends on the advice and recommendations of Dominion’s CGN Committee which is comprised of independent directors. Virginia Power’s Board approves all compensation paid to Virginia Power’s
executive officers based on Dominion’s CGN Committee recommendations.

None of Virginia Power’s directors receive any
compensation for services they provide as directors. No executive officer of Dominion or Virginia Power serves as a member of another compensation committee or on the Board of Directors of any company of which a member of Dominion’s CGN
Committee, Dominion’s Board of Directors or Virginia Power’s Board of Directors serves as an executive officer.

Because the CGN Committee effectively administers one compensation program for all of Dominion, the following discussion and analysis is
based on Dominion’s overall compensation program.

ISCUSSION

AND

A

NALYSIS

This CD&A provides a detailed explanation of the objectives and principles that underlie Dominion’s
executive compensation program, its elements and the way performance is measured, evaluated and rewarded. It also describes Dominion’s compensation decision-making process. Dominion’s executive compensation program is designed to pay for
performance and played an important role in the company’s success in 2011 by linking a significant amount of compensation to the achievement of performance goals.

The program and processes generally apply to all officers, but this discussion and analysis focuses primarily on compensation for the NEOs of Virginia Power. During 2011, Virginia Power’s NEOs were:

Ÿ

Thomas F. Farrell II, Chairman, President and CEO

Ÿ

Mark F. McGettrick, Executive Vice President and CFO

Ÿ

Paul D. Koonce, Executive Vice President and COO – DVP

Ÿ

David A. Christian, Executive Vice President and COO –Generation

Ÿ

David A. Heacock

,

President and CNO

The CGN Committee determines the compensation payable to officers of Dominion and its wholly-owned subsidiaries on an aggregate basis, taking into account all services performed by the officers, whether
for Dominion or one or more of its subsidiaries. All of Virginia Power’s NEOs, except for Mr. Heacock, are NEOs of Dominion. For the NEOs included in Dominion’s annual proxy statement, these aggregate amounts are reported in the Summary
Compensation Table and related executive compensation tables. For purposes of reporting each NEO’s compensation from Virginia Power in the Summary Compensation Table (and

related tables that follow) in this Item 11, the aggregate compensation for each NEO is pro-rated based on the ratio of services performed by the NEO for Virginia Power to the NEO’s
total services performed for all of Dominion. For officers who are NEOs of both Virginia Power and Dominion, the amounts reported in the tables below are part of, and not in addition to the aggregate compensation amounts that are reported for these
NEOs in Dominion’s 2012 Proxy Statement. The CD&A below discusses the CGN Committee’s decisions with respect to each NEO’s aggregate compensation for all services performed for all of Dominion, not just the pro-rated portion
attributable to the NEO’s services for Virginia Power.

Objectives

Dominion’s executive compensation philosophy is to provide a competitive total compensation program tied to performance and aligned with the
interests of Dominion shareholders, employees and customers.

The major objectives of Dominion’s compensation program are
to:

Ÿ

Attract, develop and retain an experienced and highly qualified management team;

Ÿ

Motivate and reward superior performance that supports Dominion’s business and strategic plans and contributes to the long-term success of the
company;

Ÿ

Align the interests of management with those of Dominion’s shareholders by placing a substantial portion of pay at risk through performance goals
that, if achieved, are expected to increase TSR;

Ÿ

Promote internal pay equity; and

Ÿ

Reinforce Dominion’s four core values of safety, ethics, excellence and One Dominion – Dominion’s term for teamwork.

These objectives provide the framework for the compensation decisions. To determine if Dominion is meeting
the objectives of its compensation program, the CGN Committee reviews and compares Dominion’s actual performance to its short-term and long-term goals, strategies, and peer companies’ performance.

Dominion’s 2011 performance indicates that the design of Dominion’s compensation program is meeting these objectives. The NEOs
have service with Dominion ranging from 13 to 35 years. Dominion has attracted, motivated and maintained a superior leadership team with skills, industry knowledge and institutional experience that strengthen their ability to act as sound stewards
of Dominion’s shareholder dollars. Dominion is performing well relative to internal goals and as compared to its peers.

In 2011, Dominion shareholders voted on the executive compensation program (also known as “Say on Pay”) for the first time and
approved it by 94%. The CGN Committee considered the very strong shareholder endorsement of the CGN Committee’s decisions and policies and Dominion’s overall executive compensation program in continuing the pay-for-performance program that
is currently in place without any specific changes for 2012 based on the vote.



The Process for Setting Compensation

The CGN Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving NEO compensation and the overall executive compensation program. Each year, the CGN Committee reviews and considers a comprehensive assessment
and analysis of the executive compensation program, including the elements of each NEO’s compensation, with input from management and the independent compensation consultant. As part of its assessment, the CGN Committee reviews the performance
of the CEO and other executive officers, meets at least annually with the CEO to discuss succession planning for his position and the positions of senior officers, reviews the share ownership guidelines and executive officer compliance with the
guidelines, and establishes compensation programs designed to achieve Dominion’s objectives.

The CGN
Committee’s practice has been to retain an independent compensation consultant, PM&P, to advise the committee on executive and director compensation matters. PM&P does not provide any services to Dominion other than its consulting
services to the CGN Committee related to executive and director compensation. The PM&P consultant participates in meetings with the CGN Committee, either in person or by teleconference, and communicates directly with the chairman of the
committee outside of the committee meetings as requested by the chairman of the committee. PM&P also reviewed meeting materials for the CGN Committee and provided the following services related to the 2011 executive compensation program:

Ÿ

Provided independent advice to the CGN Committee regarding the appropriateness of Dominion’s peer group;

Ÿ

Participated in CGN Committee executive sessions without management present to discuss CEO compensation and any other relevant matters, including the
appropriate relationship between pay and performance and emerging trends, to answer technical questions, and to review and comment on management proposals and analyses of peer group compensation data; and

Generally reviewed and offered advice as requested by or on behalf of the CGN Committee regarding other aspects of the executive compensation program,
including best practices and other matters.

Although the CGN Committee has the responsibility
to approve and monitor all compensation for the NEOs, management plays an important role in determining executive compensation. Under the direction of the Corporate Secretary, internal compensation specialists provide the CGN Committee with data,
analysis and counsel regarding the executive compensation program, including an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of the program, peer practices, and executive compensation trends and best practices. The CEO, CFO and Corporate Secretary, along
with the internal compensation and financial specialists, assist in the design of the incentive compensation plans, including performance target recommendations consistent with strategic goals, and recommendations for establishing the peer group.

Management also works with the Chairman of the CGN Committee to establish the agenda and prepare meeting information for each CGN Committee meeting.

On an annual basis, the CEO is responsible for reviewing Dominion’s succession plans for his own position and for Dominion’s
senior officers with the CGN Committee. He is also responsible for reviewing the performance of his senior officers, including the other NEOs, with the CGN Committee at least annually. He makes recommendations on the compensation and benefits for
the NEOs (other than himself) to the CGN Committee and provides other information and counsel as appropriate or as requested by the CGN Committee, but all decisions are ultimately made by the CGN Committee.

OMPARISONS

Each year, the CGN Committee approves a peer group of companies. In selecting the peer group, Dominion uses a methodology recommended by
PM&P to identify companies in the industry that compete for customers, executive talent and investment capital. Dominion screens this group based on size and usually eliminates companies that are much smaller or larger than Dominion’s size
in revenues, assets and market capitalization. Dominion also considers the geographic locations and the regulatory environment in which potential peer companies operate.

Dominion’s peer group is generally consistent from year to year, with merger and acquisition activity being the primary reason for any changes. With the announced mergers of Duke Energy Corporation
with Progress Energy, Inc. and Exelon Corporation with Constellation Energy Group, Inc. two companies were added to Dominion’s 2011 peer group: CMS Energy Corporation and Xcel Energy Inc. The members of Dominion’s peer group are as
follows:

The CGN Committee, PM&P and management use peer company data to: (i) compare Dominion’s
stock and financial performance against its peers using a number of different metrics and time periods to evaluate how Dominion is performing as compared to its peers; (ii) analyze compensation practices within the industry; (iii) evaluate
peer company practices and determine peer median and 75th percentile ranges for base pay, annual incentive pay, long-term incentive pay and total direct compensation, both generally and for specific positions; and (iv) compare Employment
Continuity Agreements and other benefits. In setting the levels for base pay, annual incentive pay, long-term incentive pay and total direct compensation, the CGN Committee also takes into consideration Dominion’s larger size compared with the
median of the peer group.

Dominion did not benchmark or otherwise use broad-based market data as the basis for compensation decisions for the NEOs and other senior officers. Survey compensation data is used only to provide a
general understanding of compensation practices and trends. The CGN Committee takes into account individual and company specific factors, including internal pay equity, along with peer company data in establishing compensation opportunities. The CGN
Committee believes that this emphasis better reflects Dominion’s specific needs in its distinct competitive market and with respect to its size and complexity versus its peers.

ESIGN

ISK

Dominion’s management, including Dominion’s chief risk officer and other executives, annually reviews the overall structure of Dominion’s
executive compensation program and policies to ensure they are consistent with effective management of enterprise key risks and that they do not encourage executives to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could threaten the value of the
enterprise. With respect to the programs and policies that apply to the NEOs, this review includes:

Ÿ

Analysis of how different elements of the compensation programs may increase or mitigate risk-taking;

Ÿ

Analysis of performance metrics used for short-term and long-term incentive programs and the relation of such incentives to the objectives of Dominion;

Ÿ

Analysis of whether the performance measurement periods for short-term and long-term incentive compensation are appropriate; and

Ÿ

Analysis of the overall structure of compensation programs as related to business risks.

Among the factors considered in management’s assessment are: the balance of the overall program design, including the mix of cash
and equity compensation; the mix of fixed and variable compensation; the balance of short-term and long-term objectives of incentive compensation; the performance metrics, performance

targets, threshold performance requirements and capped payouts related to incentive compensation; the clawback provision on incentive compensation; Dominion’s share ownership guidelines,
including share ownership levels and retention practices; prohibitions on hedging, pledging, and other derivative transactions related to Dominion stock; and internal controls and oversight structures in place at Dominion.

Management reviewed and provided the results of this assessment to the CGN Committee. Based on this review, the CGN Committee believes
that Dominion’s well-balanced mix of salary and short-term and long-term incentives, as well as the performance metrics that are included in the incentive programs, are appropriate and consistent with Dominion’s risk management practices
and overall strategies.

The CGN Committee uses a number of tools in its annual review of the compensation of Dominion’s NEOs, including charts illustrating the total range of payouts for each performance-based compensation
element under a number of different scenarios; spreadsheets showing the cumulative dollar impact on total direct compensation that could result from implementing proposals on any single element of compensation; graphs showing the relationship
between the CEO’s pay and that of the next highest-paid officer and Dominion’s NEOs as a group; and other information the CGN Committee may request in its discretion. Management’s internal compensation specialists provide the CGN
Committee with detailed comparisons of the design and features of Dominion’s long-term incentive and other executive benefit programs with available information regarding similar programs at the peer companies. These tools are used as part of
the overall process to ensure that the program results in appropriate pay relationships as compared to Dominion’s peer companies and internally among Dominion’s NEOs, and that an appropriate balance of at-risk, performance-based
compensation is maintained to support the program’s core objectives. No material adjustments were made to Dominion’s NEO’s compensation as a result of using these tools.

The executive compensation program consists of four basic elements:

Factors in Setting Compensation

As part of the process of setting compensation targets, approving payouts and designing future programs, the CGN Committee evaluates Dominion’s overall performance versus its business plans and
strategies, its short-term and long-term goals and the performance of its peer companies. In addition to considering Dominion’s overall performance for the year, the CGN Committee takes into consideration several individual factors that are not
given any specific weighting in setting each element of compensation for each NEO, including:

Ÿ

An officer’s experience and job performance;

Ÿ

The scope, complexity and significance of responsibility for a position, including any differences from peer company positions;

Ÿ

Internal pay equity considerations, such as the relative importance of a particular position or individual officer to Dominion’s strategy and
success, and comparability to other officer positions at Dominion;

Ÿ

Retention and market competitive concerns; and

Ÿ

The officer’s role in any succession plan for other key positions.

The CGN Committee generally evaluates each NEO’s base salary, total cash and total direct compensation opportunities against peer
group data, both at peer group median and the 75th percentile, to ensure the compensation levels are appropriately competitive, but with the exception of base salary, does not target these compensation levels at a particular percentile or range of
the peer group data. Base salary is generally targeted at or slightly above the peer group 50th percentile (median). For Mr. Heacock, the same evaluation process is performed using the Towers Watson Energy Services data instead of peer group data.
See Exhibit 99 of this Form 10-K for a listing of the companies included in the survey. Compensation decisions are based on what the

CGN Committee deems appropriate, taking into consideration a number of factors, including those discussed above. However, actual compensation targets may range from below peer median to at or
above the 75th percentile based on a number of factors, including experience, tenure and internal pay equity considerations. As part of this analysis, the CGN Committee also takes into account Dominion’s larger size and complexity compared to
its peer companies.

In setting compensation for 2011, due to continued economic uncertainty, Dominion provided a modest
increase in base salary for all officers, generally, and made adjustments to performance-based compensation target levels for certain officers. Based on the review of peer company compensation data, each NEO’s job performance, recent promotions
and internal pay equity considerations such as scope and complexity of the position relative to other positions at Dominion, the CGN Committee determined it was appropriate to increase the target levels under the LTIP for Messrs. McGettrick,
Christian and Heacock as described below in

Long-Term Incentive Program

.

CEO Compensation Relative to Other NEOs

Mr. Farrell participates in the same compensation programs and receives compensation based on the same philosophy and factors as other NEOs.
Application of the same philosophy and factors to Mr. Farrell’s position results in overall CEO compensation that is significantly higher than the compensation of the other NEOs. His compensation is commensurate with his greater
responsibilities and decision-making authority, broader scope of duties encompassing the entirety of Dominion (as compared to the other NEOs who are responsible for significant but distinct areas within the company) and his overall responsibility
for corporate strategy. His compensation also reflects his role as the principal corporate representative to investors, customers, regulators, analysts, legislators, industry and the media.



Dominion considers CEO compensation trends as compared to the next highest-paid officer, as
well as to other executive officers as a group, over a multi-year period to monitor the ratio of Mr. Farrell’s pay relative to the pay of other executive officers based on (i) salary only and (ii) total direct compensation.
Dominion also compares its ratios to that of its peers to confirm that its ratios are consistent with practices at the peer companies. There is no particular targeted ratio or goal, but instead the CGN Committee considers year-to-year trends and
comparisons with peer companies. The CGN Committee did not make any adjustments to the compensation of any NEOs based on this review in 2011.

Allocation of Total Direct Compensation in 2011

Consistent with Dominion’s objective to reward strong performance based on the achievement of short-term and long-term goals, a significant portion
of total cash and total direct compensation is at risk. Approximately 88% of Mr. Farrell’s targeted 2011 total direct compensation is performance-based, tied to pre-approved performance metrics, including relative TSR and ROIC, or tied to
the performance of Dominion’s stock. For the other NEOs, performance-based and stock-based compensation ranges from 65% to 80% of targeted 2011 total direct compensation. This compares to an average of approximately 54% of targeted compensation
at risk for most officers at the vice president level and an average of approximately 12% of total pay at risk for non-officer employees.

The charts below illustrate the elements of total direct compensation opportunities in 2011 for Mr. Farrell and the other NEOs as a group and the allocation of such compensation among base salary,
targeted 2011 AIP award and targeted 2011 long-term incentive compensation.

Base Salary

Base salary compensates officers, along with the rest of the workforce, for committing significant time to working on Dominion’s behalf. Annual salary reviews achieve two primary purposes:
(i) an annual adjustment, as appropriate, to keep salaries in line and competitive with the peer group and to reflect changes in responsibility, including promotions; and (ii) a motivational tool to acknowledge and reward excellent
individual performance, special skills, experience, the strategic impact of a position relative to other Dominion executives and other relevant considerations.

The primary goal is to compensate its officers at a level that best achieves its objectives and reflects the considerations discussed above. Dominion believes that an overall goal of targeting base salary
at or slightly above the peer group median is a conservative but appropriate target for base pay. However, an individual’s compensation may be below or above Dominion’s target range based on a number of factors such as performance, tenure,
and other factors explained above in

Factors in Setting Compensation

. In addition to being ranked above the peer group median in 2011 in terms of revenues, assets and market capitalization, the scope of Dominion’s business operations is
complex and unique in its industry. Successfully managing such a broad and complex business requires a skilled and experienced management team. Dominion believes it would not be able to successfully recruit and retain such a team if the base pay for
officers was generally below the peer group median. Although individual and company performance would have supported merit increases, most officers, including all NEOs, have received modest or no increases in their base salaries since 2009 due to
the uncertain market conditions and economic climate. For 2011, the CGN Committee approved a 2% base salary increase for all NEOs, except for Mr. Heacock. Mr. Heacock’s base salary was increased by 10% due to his continued transition to
the President and CNO position which he assumed in June 2009. The 2011 merit increase was Mr. Farrell’s first increase in base salary since 2008.

Annual Incentive Plan

O

VERVIEW

The AIP plays an important role in meeting Dominion’s overall objective of rewarding strong performance. The AIP is a cash-based program focused on
short-term goal accomplishments and is designed to:

Ÿ

Tie interests of shareholders, customers and employees closely together;

Ÿ

Focus the workforce on company, operating group, team and individual goals that ultimately influence operational and financial results;

Ÿ

Reward corporate and operating unit earnings performance;

Ÿ

Reward safety and other operating and stewardship goal success;

Ÿ

Emphasize teamwork by focusing on common goals;

Ÿ

Appropriately balance risk and reward; and

Ÿ

Provide a competitive total compensation opportunity.

T

ARGET

A

WARDS

An NEO’s compensation opportunity under
the AIP is based on a target award. Target awards are determined as a percentage of a participant’s base salary (for example, 85% of base salary). The



target award is the amount of cash that will be paid if a participant achieves a score of 100% for the goals established at the beginning of the year and the plan is funded at the full funding
target set for the year. Participants who retire during the plan year are eligible to receive a prorated payment of their AIP award after the end of the plan year based on final funding and goal achievement. Participants who voluntarily terminate
employment during the plan year and who are not eligible to retire (before attainment of age 55) forfeit their AIP award.

AIP target award levels are established based on a number of factors, including historical practice, individual and company performance
and internal pay equity considerations, and are compared against peer group data to ensure the appropriate competitiveness of an NEO’s total cash compensation opportunity. However, as discussed above, AIP target award levels were not targeted
at a specific percentile or range of the peer group data, nor was survey data used in setting AIP target award levels for 2011. Annual incentive target award levels are also consistent with Dominion’s intent to have a significant portion of NEO
compensation at risk. The 2011 AIP targets for all NEOs were the same as the 2010 AIP targets and are shown below.

* As a % of base salary

F

UNDING

OF

THE

2011 AIP

Funding of the 2011
AIP was based solely on consolidated operating earnings per share, with potential funding ranging from 0% to 200% of the target funding. Consolidated operating earnings are Dominion’s reported earnings determined in accordance with GAAP,
adjusted for certain items. Dominion believes that by placing a focus on pre-established consolidated operating earnings per share targets, it increases employee awareness of the company’s financial objectives and encourages behavior and
performance that will help achieve these objectives.

The 2011 AIP had a full funding target of $3.05 consolidated operating
earnings per share, which was at the lower end of the 2011 earnings guidance announced in January 2011 and the revised earnings guidance that was announced in October 2011. Funding is based on a formula where funding begins for all eligible
employees, including all of the NEOs, when Dominion is able to report $3.05 consolidated operating earnings per share, exclusive of AIP funding expense. Additional earnings are then used to fund the AIP up to a 100% funding level. Once operating
earnings support $3.05 consolidated operating earnings per share with all employees’ AIP funded at 100%, then any additional consolidated operating earnings above the full funding target of $3.05 operating earnings per share are shared equally
between AIP participants and shareholders, up to the maximum AIP funding level of 200% at $3.16 operating earnings per share.

Full funding means that the AIP is 100% funded and participants can receive their full targeted AIP payout if they achieve a

score of 100% for their particular goal package, as described below in

How AIP Payouts are Determined

. At the maximum plan funding level of 200%, participants can earn up to two times
their targeted AIP payout, subject to achievement of their individual goal packages.

Dominion’s consolidated operating
earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $1.75 billion, or $3.05 per share, as compared to its consolidated reported earnings in accordance with GAAP of $1.41 billion or $2.45 per share.* This resulted in 75% funding for the 2011
AIP.

*Reconciliation of 2011 Consolidated Operating Earnings to Reported Earnings.

The following items, which are
after-tax, are included in Dominion’s 2011 reported earnings, but are excluded from consolidated operating earnings: $178 million impairment charge related to certain utility and merchant coal-fired power stations; $59 million of
restoration costs associated with Hurricane Irene; $39 million net loss from operations at Kewaunee, which is being marketed for sale; $34 million impairment of excess emission allowances resulting from a new EPA air pollution rule; $21 million of
severance costs and other charges resulting from expected closings of Salem Harbor and State Line; $19 million net charge in connection with the Virginia Commission’s final ruling associated with its biennial review of Virginia Power’s
base rates for 2009-2010 test years; $13 million of earthquake related costs, largely related to inspections following the safe shutdown of reactors at North Anna; $14 million benefit related to litigation with the DOE for spent nuclear fuel-related
costs at Millstone and $3 million net benefit related to other items.

For most officers other than Dominion’s NEOs, payout of their funded AIP awards for 2011 was subject to the
accomplishment of business unit financial and operating and stewardship goals, including a safety goal. The percentage allocated to each category of goals represents the percentage of the funded award subject to the performance of that goal. Officer
goals are weighted according to their responsibilities. The overall score cannot exceed 100%.

Business unit financial goals
provide a line-of-sight performance target for officers within a business unit and, on a combined basis, support the consolidated operating earnings target for Dominion. Operating and stewardship goals provide line-of-sight performance targets that
may not be financial and that can be customized for each individual or by segments of each business unit. Operating and stewardship goals promote Dominion’s core values of safety, ethics, excellence and teamwork, which in turn contribute to
Dominion’s financial success.

The AIP is designed so that AIP payouts earned by Dominion’s NEOs will qualify as tax
deductible “performance-based” compensation under Section 162(m) of the IRC. To preserve the tax deduction for payouts made to the NEOs whose compensation is subject to IRC Section 162(m), their payout, if any, is contingent
solely on the achievement of the consolidated financial goal (weighted 100%). If the consolidated financial goal is met, the CGN Committee has the authority to exercise negative discretion to lower payouts if additional discretionary goals are
adopted and these discretionary goals are not achieved.



For the 2011 AIP, all of the NEOs adopted a discretionary safety goal. Messrs. Koonce,
Christian and Heacock also adopted discretionary business unit financial goals and Mr. Heacock also adopted discretionary operating and stewardship goals. These goals are described under

2011 AIP Payouts

. The following table shows the goal
weightings applied to the NEOs’ discretionary goals.

* 5% goal weighting is for safety goal. Mr. Heacock had other non-safety operating and stewardship goals as
described below.

The formula for calculating an award is:

The 2011 discretionary business unit financial goals and accomplishment levels for Mr. Koonce (DVP)
and Messrs. Christian and Heacock (Dominion Generation) were as follows:

For 2011, amounts for the AIP expense were not included in all business units’ budgets and are not
reflected in the goal threshold and goal for 100% payout amounts shown above. The CGN Committee considered each business unit’s net income amount, including and excluding the expense for the AIP, and determined it was appropriate to approve
100% accomplishment of the business unit financial goals.

Both Messrs. Farrell and McGettrick met their target safety goal of
four or less OSHA recordable incidents with an incident rate of 0.15 or less for the DRS business unit. For Mr. Koonce, DVP’s OSHA incident rate and lost time/restricted duty rate exceeded the target rates of 1.24 and 0.75, respectively,
which resulted in a 52% accomplishment of his safety goal. Mr. Christian met his target safety goal of an OSHA incident rate ranging from 0.23 to 2.0 for certain operating units and recordable incident of 1 or less for another operating unit in
the Dominion Generation business unit. Mr. Heacock met his target safety goal of total OSHA recordable injuries of ten or less (weighted 6%) and total station clock resets of six or less for the Dominion Nuclear fleet (weighted 8%).

In addition to his safety goal, Mr. Heacock had discretionary operating and stewardship goals in three other categories: environmental
compliance (weighted 5%); radiation exposure (weighted 4%); and fleet capacity factor (weighted 7%). Mr. Heacock met his environmental compliance and radiation exposure goals, but missed his fleet capacity factor goal. Mr. Heacock earned five extra
credit points for safety by exceeding his overall safety goal and was able to apply the extra credit to his missed fleet capacity factor goal in accordance with the AIP guidelines. As a result, Mr. Heacock’s total payout score was 100%.

Long-Term Incentive Program

O

VERVIEW

Dominion’s LTIP focuses on Dominion’s longer-term
strategic goals and retention of its executives. Since 2006, 50% of Dominion’s long-term incentives have been full value equity awards in the form of restricted stock with time-based vesting and the other 50% have been performance-based awards.
Dominion believes restricted stock serves as a strong retention tool and also creates a focus on Dominion’s stock price to further align the interests of officers with the interests of its shareholders and customers. For those officers who have
made substantial progress toward their share ownership guidelines, 50% of their long-term award is in the form of a cash performance grant. Officers who have not achieved 50% of their targeted share ownership guideline receive goal-based stock
performance grants instead of a cash performance grant. Dividend equivalents are not paid on any performance-based grants. Because officers are expected to retain ownership of shares upon vesting of restricted stock awards, as explained in

Share
Ownership Guidelines,

the long-term cash performance grant balances the program and allows a portion of the long-term incentive award to be accessible to the NEOs during the course of their employment.

The CGN Committee approves long-term incentive awards in January each year with a grant date established in early February. This process
ensures incentive-based awards are made at the beginning of the performance period and shortly after the public disclosure of Dominion’s earnings for the prior year. Like the AIP target award levels discussed above, long-term incentive target
award levels are established based on a number of factors, including historical practice, individual and company performance, and internal pay equity considerations, and are compared against peer group data to ensure the appropriate competitiveness
of an NEO’s total direct compensation opportunity. However, as discussed above, long-term incentive target award levels are not targeted at a specific percentile or range of the peer group data, nor was market survey data a factor in setting
long-term incentive target award levels for 2011.

For 2011, the CGN Committee approved increases to Messrs. McGettrick,
Christian and Heacock’s target long-term incentive awards as discussed below.

M

G

ETTRICK

. Among the factors considered by the CGN Committee in determining the amount
of Mr. McGettrick’s award were Mr. McGettrick’s long tenure with Dominion, his performance as CFO and his increased responsibilities as a result of his promotion from CEO of the Dominion Generation business unit to CFO of
Dominion in 2009. The CGN Committee determined it was appropriate to approve an 11% increase in Mr. McGettrick’s target long-term incentive award, which resulted in a 7% increase in target total direct compensation.

C

HRISTIAN

. For Mr. Christian, the CGN Committee considered, among other factors, Mr. Christian’s long tenure with Dominion, his performance as CEO of the Dominion Generation business
unit and Mr. Christian’s increased responsibility as a result of his promotion from President and CNO of the Dominion Nuclear unit in 2009 to his current position. The CGN Committee also considered the size of the Dominion Generation
business unit, which is the largest of Dominion’s three business units, relative to Dominion’s other business units in

determining his long-term incentive target award and the continued transition of Mr. Christian’s compensation to a business unit CEO level. The CGN Committee determined it was
appropriate to approve a 32% increase in Mr. Christian’s target long-term incentive award, which resulted in a 16% increase in target total direct compensation.

H

EACOCK

. Among the factors considered by the
CGN Committee in determining the amount of Mr. Heacock’s award were his long tenure with Dominion, his performance as President and CNO of the Dominion Nuclear unit and his increased responsibilities related to that position and the
complexity of the nuclear industry. The CGN Committee determined it was appropriate to approve an 11% increase in Mr. Heacock’s long-term incentive award, which resulted in a 10.5% increase in target total direct compensation.

All officers received a restricted stock grant on February 1, 2011 based on a stated dollar value. The number of shares awarded was determined by
dividing the stated dollar value by the closing price of Dominion’s common stock on January 31, 2011. The grants have a three-year vesting term, with cliff vesting at the end of the restricted period on February 1, 2014. Dividends are

Most officers, including the NEOs, received cash performance grants on February 1, 2011. The performance period commenced on January 1, 2011 and will end on December 31, 2012. The 2011
grants are denominated as a target award, with potential payouts ranging from 0-200% of the target based on Dominion’s TSR relative to the peer group of companies selected by the CGN Committee and ROIC, weighted equally. The CGN Committee
regularly reviews the design of the LTIP. As part of its annual review of the compensation peer group, the CGN Committee also considers the relevance of the compensation peer group for measuring relative TSR under performance-based awards.

The TSR metric was selected to focus officers on long-term shareholder value when developing and implementing their strategic
plans and in turn, reward management based on the achievement of TSR levels as measured relative to Dominion’s peer companies. The ROIC metric was selected to reward officers for the achievement of expected levels of return on Dominion’s
investments. Dominion believes an ROIC measure encourages management to choose the right investments, and with those investments, to achieve the highest returns possible through prudent decisions, management and control of costs. The target award
and vesting terms of 2011 performance grants made to the NEOs are disclosed in the

Grants of Plan-Based Awards

In February 2012, final payouts were made to officers who received 2010 performance grants, including the NEOs. The 2010 performance
grants were based on two goals: TSR for the two-year period ended December 31, 2011 relative to Dominion’s peer group of companies (weighted 50%) and ROIC for the same two-year period (weighted 50%).

Ÿ

Relative TSR (50% weighting).

TSR is the difference between the value of a share of common stock at the beginning and end of the two-year
performance period, plus dividends paid as if reinvested in stock. For this metric, Dominion’s TSR is compared to TSR levels at its peer companies for the same two-year period. The peer group for the TSR metric for the 2010 performance grant is
the same group of companies described above in

The Peer Group and Peer Group Comparisons

, excluding CMS Energy Corporation and Xcel Energy Inc. The relative TSR targets and corresponding payout scores are as follows:

*

TSR weighting is interpolated between the top and bottom of the percentages within a quartile. A minimum payment of 25% of the TSR percentage will be made if the TSR
performance is at least 10% on a compounded annual basis for the performance period, regardless of relative performance.

Actual relative TSR performance for the 2010-2011 period was in the top quartile.

Ÿ

ROIC (50% weighting).

ROIC reflects Dominion’s total return divided by average invested capital for the performance period. The ROIC goal
at target is consistent with the strategic plan/annual business plan as approved by Dominion’s Board. For this purpose, total return is Dominion’s consolidated operating earnings plus its after-tax interest and related charges, plus
preferred dividends. Dominion designed its 2010 ROIC goals to provide 100% payout if it achieved an average ROIC of 8.00% over the two-year performance period. The ROIC performance targets and corresponding payout scores are as follows:

*

ROIC percentage payout is interpolated between the top and bottom of the percentages for any range.

Actual ROIC performance for the 2010-2011 period was 8.18%.

Based on the achievement of the performance criteria, the CGN Committee approved a 175.7%
payout for the 2010 performance grants. The following table summarizes the achievement of the 2010 performance criteria:

Employee and
Executive Benefits

Benefit plans and limited perquisites compose the fourth element of the compensation program. These benefits serve as a
retention tool and reward long-term employment.

R

ETIREMENT

P

LANS

Dominion sponsors two types of tax-qualified retirement plans for eligible non-union employees, including the NEOs: a defined benefit pension plan and a
defined contribution 401(k) savings plan. The NEOs, as employees hired before 2008, are eligible for a pension benefit upon attainment of retirement age based on a formula that takes into account final compensation and years of service. They also
receive a cash retirement benefit under which Dominion contributes 2% of each participant’s compensation to a special retirement account, which may be paid in a lump sum or added to the annuity benefit upon retirement. Dominion began funding
the special retirement account for eligible employees in January 2001. The formula for the DPP is explained in the narrative following the

Pension Benefits

table. The change in DPP value for 2011 for the NEOs is included in the

Summary
Compensation Table

.

Officers whose matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan are limited by the IRC receive a cash
payment to make them whole for the company match lost as a result of these limits. These cash payments are currently taxable. The company matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan and the cash payments of company matching contributions above IRC
limits for the NEOs are included in the

All Other Compensation

column of the

Summary Compensation Table

and detailed in the footnote for that column.



Dominion also maintains two nonqualified retirement plans for its executives, the BRP and
the ESRP. Unlike the DPP and 401(k) Plan, these plans are unfunded, unsecured obligations of Dominion. These plans keep Dominion competitive in attracting and retaining officers. Due to IRC limits on pension plan benefits and because a more
substantial portion of total compensation for officers is paid as incentive compensation than for other employees, the DPP and 401(k) Plan alone will produce a lower percentage of replacement income in retirement for officers than these plans will
for other employees. The BRP restores benefits that will not be paid under the DPP due to the IRC limits. The ESRP provides a benefit that covers a portion (25%) of final base salary and target annual incentive compensation to partially make up
for this gap in retirement income. The BRP and ESRP do not include long-term incentive compensation in benefit calculations and, therefore, a significant portion of the potential compensation for the officers is excluded from calculation in any
retirement plan benefit. As consideration for the benefits earned under the BRP and ESRP, all officers agree to comply with confidentiality and one-year non-competition requirements set forth in the plan documents following their retirement or other
termination of employment. The present value of accumulated benefits under these retirement plans is disclosed in the

Pension Benefits

table and the terms of the plans are fully explained in the narrative following that table.

In individual situations and primarily for mid-career changes or retention purposes, the CGN Committee has granted certain officers
additional years of credited age and service for purposes of calculating benefits under the BRP. Age and service credits granted to the NEOs are described in

Dominion Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan

under

Pension Benefits.

Additional age and service may also be earned under the terms of an officer’s Employee Continuity Agreement in the event of a change in control, as described in

Change in Control

under

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change
in Control.

No additional years of credit were granted to the NEOs during 2011.

ROGRAMS

Dominion’s officers participate in all of the benefit programs available to other Dominion employees. The
core benefit programs generally include medical, dental and vision benefit plans, a health savings account, health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, group-term life insurance, travel accident coverage, long-term disability coverage and
a paid time off program.

Dominion also maintains an executive life insurance program for officers to replace a former
company-wide retiree life insurance program that was discontinued in 2003. The plan is fully insured by individual policies that provide death benefits at a fixed amount depending on an officer’s salary tier. This life insurance coverage is in
addition to the group-term insurance that is provided to all employees. The officer is the owner of the policy and Dominion makes premium payments until the later of 10 years from enrollment date or the date the officer attains age 64. Officers are
taxed on the premiums paid by Dominion. The premiums for these policies are included in the

All Other Compensation

column of the

Summary Compensation Table

.

P

ERQUISITES

Dominion provides a limited number of perquisites for officers to enable them to perform their duties and responsibilities as efficiently as possible and to minimize distractions. The CGN Committee
annually reviews the perquisites to ensure they are an effective and efficient use of corporate resources. Dominion believes the benefits it receives from offering these perquisites outweigh the costs of providing them. In addition to incidental
perquisites associated with maintaining an office, Dominion offers the following perquisites to all officers:

Ÿ

An allowance of up to $9,500 a year to be used for health club memberships and wellness programs, comprehensive executive physical exams and financial
and estate planning. Dominion wants officers to be proactive with preventive healthcare and also wants executives to use professional, independent financial and estate planning consultants to ensure proper tax reporting of company-provided
compensation and to help officers optimize their use of Dominion’s retirement and other employee benefit programs.

Ÿ

A vehicle leased by Dominion, up to an established lease-payment limit (if the lease payment exceeds the allowance, the officer pays for the excess
amount on the vehicle). The costs of insurance, fuel and maintenance for company-leased vehicles are paid by Dominion.

Ÿ

In limited circumstances, use of company aircraft for personal travel by executive officers. For security and other reasons, the Board has directed
Mr. Farrell to use the aircraft for all travel, including personal travel, whenever it is feasible to do so. His family and guests may accompany Mr. Farrell on any personal trips. The use of company aircraft for personal travel by other
executive officers is limited and usually related to (i) travel with the CEO or (ii) personal travel to accommodate business demands on an executive’s schedule. With the exception of Mr. Farrell, personal use of aircraft is not
available when there is a company need for the aircraft. Use of company aircraft saves substantial time and allows Dominion to have better access to the executives for business purposes. During 2011, 97% of the use of Dominion’s aircraft was
for business purposes. Other than Mr. Farrell, none of the NEOs or other executive officers used company aircraft for personal travel in 2011.

Other than costs associated with comprehensive executive physical exams (which are exempt from taxation under the IRC), these perquisites are fully taxable to officers. There is no tax gross-up for
imputed income on any perquisites.

GREEMENTS

Dominion has entered into Employment Continuity Agreements with all officers to ensure continuity in the event of a change in control at Dominion. While
Dominion has determined these agreements are consistent with the practices of its peer companies, the most important reason for these agreements is to protect the company in the event of an anticipated or actual change in control of Dominion. In a
time of transition, it is critical to protect shareholder value by retaining and continuing to motivate the company’s core management team. In a change in control situation, workloads typically increase dramatically, outside competitors are
more likely to attempt to recruit top performers away



from the company, and officers and other key employees may consider other opportunities when faced with uncertainties at their own company. Therefore, the Employment Continuity Agreements provide
security and protection to officers in such circumstances for the long-term benefit of Dominion and its shareholders.

In
determining the appropriate multiples of compensation and benefits payable upon a change in control, Dominion evaluated peer group and general practices and considered the levels of protection necessary to retain officers in such situations. The
Employment Continuity Agreements are double-trigger agreements that require both a change in control and a qualifying termination of employment to trigger a benefit. The specific terms of the Employment Continuity Agreements are discussed in

Dominion does not have comprehensive employment agreements or severance agreements for its NEOs. Although the CGN Committee believes the compensation and

valuable knowledge and experience and to secure and retain their services, Dominion has entered into letter agreements with certain of its NEOs to provide certain benefit enhancements or other protections, as described in

Share Ownership Guidelines

Dominion requires officers to own and retain significant amounts of Dominion stock during their careers to align their interests with those of
Dominion’s shareholders by promoting a long-term focus through long-term share ownership. The guidelines ensure that management maintains a personal stake in the company through significant equity investment in Dominion. Targeted ownership
levels are the lesser of the following value or number of shares:

The levels of ownership reflect the increasing level of responsibility for that officer’s position.
Shares owned by an officer and his or her immediate family members as well as shares held under company benefit plans contribute to the ownership targets. Restricted stock, goal-based stock and shares underlying stock options do not contribute to
the ownership targets until the shares vest or the options are exercised. Dominion prohibits certain types of transactions related to Dominion stock, including owning derivative securities, hedging transactions, using margin accounts and pledging
shares as collateral.

With limited exceptions, officers are expected to retain ownership of their Dominion stock,
including restricted stock and goal-based shares that have vested, as long as they remain employed by the company. Dominion refers to shares held by an officer that are more than 15% above his or her ownership target as Qualifying Excess Shares.
Officers may sell up to 50% of their Qualifying Excess Shares at any time, subject to insider trading rules and other policy provisions, and may sell all Qualifying Excess Shares during the one-year period preceding retirement. Qualifying Excess
Shares may also be gifted to a charitable organization or put into a trust outside of the officer’s control for estate planning purposes at any time.

At least annually, the CGN Committee reviews the share ownership guidelines and monitors compliance by executive officers, both individually and by the officer group as a whole. The NEOs’ ownership
is shown in Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. Each NEO exceeds his ownership target.

Recovery of Incentive Compensation

Consistent with standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, Dominion’s Corporate Governance Guidelines authorize the Board to seek recovery of performance-based compensation paid to officers who are found to be personally responsible for fraud or intentional misconduct that causes a restatement
of financial results filed with the SEC. Beginning in 2009, the CGN Committee approved a broader clawback provision for inclusion in Dominion’s AIP and long-term incentive performance grant documents. This clawback provision authorizes the CGN
Committee, in its discretion and based on facts and circumstances, to recoup AIP and performance grant payouts from any employee whose fraudulent or intentional misconduct (i) directly causes or partially causes the need for a restatement of a
financial statement or (ii) relates to or materially affects Dominion’s operations or the employee’s duties at the company. Dominion reserves the right to recover a payout by seeking repayment from the employee, by reducing the amount
that would otherwise be payable to the employee under another company benefit plan or compensation program to the extent permitted by applicable law, by withholding future incentive compensation, or any combination of these actions. The clawback
provision is in addition to, and not in lieu of, other actions Dominion may take to remedy or discipline misconduct, including termination of employment or a legal action for breach of fiduciary duty, and any actions imposed by law enforcement
agencies.

Tax Deductibility of Compensation

IRC Section 162(m) generally disallows a deduction by publicly held corporations for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the CEO and next three most highly compensated officers other than
the CFO. If certain requirements are met, performance-based compensation qualifies for an exemption from the IRC Section 162(m) deduction limit. Dominion intends to provide competitive executive compensation while maximizing Dominion’s tax
deduction. While the CGN Committee considers IRC Section 162(m) tax implications when designing annual and long-term compensation programs and approving payouts under such programs, it reserves the right to approve, and in some cases has
approved, non-deductible compensation when corporate



objectives justify the cost of being unable to deduct such compensation. Dominion’s tax department has advised the CGN Committee that the cost of any such lost tax deductions is not material
to the company.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

Dominion measures and recognizes compensation expense in accordance with the FASB guidance for share-based payments, which requires that compensation expense relating to share-based payment transactions
be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The CGN Committee considers the accounting treatment of equity and performance-based compensation when approving awards.

The Summary Compensation Table provides information in accordance with SEC requirements regarding
compensation earned by the NEOs, stock awards made to the NEOs, as well as amounts accrued or accumulated during years reported with respect to retirement plans and other items. The NEOs include the CEO, the CFO, and the three most highly
compensated executive officers of Virginia Power other than the CEO and CFO.

The amounts reported in the Summary
Compensation Table and the other tables below represent the prorated compensation amounts attributable to each NEO’s services performed for Virginia Power. The percentage of each NEO’s overall Dominion services performed for Virginia Power
during 2011 was as follows: Mr. Farrell, 32%; Mr. McGettrick, 49%; Mr. Koonce, 84%; Mr. Christian, 55%; and Mr. Heacock, 52%.

The following highlights some of the disclosures contained in this table for the NEOs. Detailed explanations regarding certain types of compensation paid to an NEO are included in the footnotes to the
table.

Salary.

The amounts in
this column are the base salaries earned by the NEOs for the years indicated. For 2010, this amount also includes a 2% merit lump sum payment to all NEOs.

Stock Awards.

The amounts in this column reflect the full grant date fair value of the
stock awards for accounting purposes for the respective year. Stock awards are reported in the year in which the awards are granted regardless of when or if the awards vest or are exercised.

Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.

This column includes amounts earned under two performance-based programs: the AIP and cash-based performance grant awards under Dominion’s LTIP. These performance programs are based on performance
criteria established by the CGN Committee at the beginning of the performance period, with actual performance scored against the pre-set criteria by the CGN Committee at the end of the performance period.

Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings.

This column shows any year-over-year increases in the annual accrual of pension and supplemental retirement benefits for the NEOs. These are accruals for future benefits that may be earned under the
terms of the retirement plans, and are not actual payments made during the year to the NEOs. The amounts disclosed reflect the annual change in the

actuarial present value of benefits under defined benefit plans sponsored by Dominion, which include Dominion’s tax-qualified pension plan and the nonqualified plans described in the
narrative following the

Pension Benefits

table. The annual change equals the difference in the accumulated amount for the current fiscal year and the accumulated amount for the prior fiscal year, generally using the same actuarial assumptions
used for Dominion’s audited financial statements for the applicable fiscal year. Accrued benefit calculations are based on assumptions that the NEOs would retire at the earliest age at which they are projected to become eligible for full,
unreduced pension benefits (including the effect of future service for eligibility purposes), instead of their unreduced retirement age based on current years of service. The application of these assumptions results in a greater increase in the
accumulated amount of pension benefits for certain NEOs than would result without the application of these assumptions. This method of calculation does not increase actual benefits payable at retirement but only how much of that benefit is allocated
to the increase during the years presented in the Summary Compensation Table. Please refer to the footnotes to the

Pension Benefits

table and the narrative following that table for additional information related to actuarial assumptions used
to calculate pension benefits.

All Other Compensation.

The amounts in this column disclose compensation that is not classified as compensation reportable in another column, including perquisites and benefits with an aggregate value of at least $10,000, the
value of company-paid life insurance premiums, company matching contributions to an NEO’s 401(k) Plan account, and company matching contributions paid directly to the NEO that would be credited to the 401(k) Plan if IRC contribution limits did
not apply. For 2010 and 2011, dividends paid on outstanding restricted stock are not included in All Other Compensation in accordance with SEC rules as the value of the dividends is factored into the grant date fair value of the restricted stock.

Total.

The
number in this column provides a single figure that represents the total compensation either earned by each NEO for the years indicated or accrued benefits payable in later years and required to be disclosed by SEC rules in this table. It does not
reflect actual compensation paid to the NEO during the year, but is the sum of the dollar values of each type of compensation quantified in the other columns in accordance with SEC rules.

The 2011 amounts in this column include the payout under Dominion’s 2011 AIP and 2010 Performance Grant Awards. All of the named executive
officers received 75% funding of their 2011 AIP target awards and 100% payout for accomplishment of their goals except Mr. Koonce who achieved a 97.6% payout. The 2011 AIP payout amounts were as follows: Mr. Farrell: $369,725;
Mr. McGettrick: $241,500; Mr. Koonce: $280,141; Mr. Christian: $197,844; and Mr. Heacock: $114,822. See the CD&A for additional information on the 2011 AIP and the Grants of Plan Based Awards table for the range of each
NEO’s potential award under the 2011 AIP. The 2010 Performance Grant Award was issued on February 1, 2010 and the payout amount was determined based on achievement of performance goals for the performance period ended December 31,
2011. Payouts can range from 0% to 200%. The actual payout was 175.7% of the target amount. The payout amounts were as follows: Mr. Farrell: $1,981,369; Mr. McGettrick: $766,931; Mr. Koonce: $827,514; Mr. Christian: $410,251 and
Mr. Heacock: $203,671. The 2010 amounts in this column reflect both the 2010 AIP and the 2009 Performance Grant payouts, and the 2009 amounts reflect both the 2009 AIP and 2008 Performance Grant payouts.

All amounts in this column are for the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the NEO’s accumulated benefit under the qualified DPP
and nonqualified executive retirement plans. There are no above-market earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation plans. These accruals are not directly in relation to final payout potential, and can vary significantly year over year based on
(i) promotions and corresponding changes in salary; (ii) other one-time adjustments to salary or incentive target for market or other reasons; (iii) actual age versus predicted age at retirement; and (iv) other relevant factors.

The following table provides information about stock awards and non-equity incentive awards granted to the NEOs
during the year ended December 31, 2011.

Note: The NEOs included in this table perform services for more than one subsidiary of Dominion. Compensation for the
NEOs listed in the table reflects only the applicable portion related to their service for Virginia Power in the year presented.

(1)

On January 20, 2011, the CGN Committee approved the 2011 long-term
incentive compensation awards for Dominion officers, which consisted of a restricted stock grant and a cash performance grant. The 2011 restricted stock award was granted on February 1, 2011. Under the 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan, fair
market value is defined as the closing price of Dominion common stock as of the last day on which the stock is traded preceding the date of grant. The grant date fair market value for the February 1, 2011 restricted stock grant was $43.54 per
share, which was Dominion’s closing stock price on January 31, 2011.

(


)

Amounts represent the range of potential payouts under the 2011 AIP. Actual amounts paid under the 2011 AIP are found in the Non-Equity Incentive
Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. Under Dominion’s AIP, officers are eligible for an annual performance-based award. The CGN Committee establishes target awards for each NEO based on his salary level and expressed as a
percentage of the individual NEO’s base salary. The target award is the amount of cash that will be paid if the plan is fully funded and payout goals are achieved. For the 2011 AIP, funding was based on the achievement of consolidated operating
earnings goals with the maximum funding capped at 200%, as explained under the Annual Incentive Plan section of the CD&A.

(3)

Amounts represent the range of potential payouts under the 2011
performance grant of the LTIP. Payouts can range from 0% to 200% of the target award. Awards will be paid by March 15, 2013 depending on the achievement of performance goals for the two-year period ending December 31, 2012. The amount
earned will depend on the level of achievement of two performance metrics: TSR—50% and ROIC—50%. TSR measures Dominion’s share performance for the two-year period ended December 31, 2012 relative to the TSR of a group of industry
peers selected by the CGN Committee. ROIC goal achievement will be scored against 2011 and 2012 budget goals.

The performance grant is forfeited in its entirety if an officer voluntarily terminates employment or is terminated with cause before the vesting date. The grants
have pro-rated vesting for retirement, termination without cause, death or disability. In the case of retirement, pro-rated vesting will not occur if the CEO (or, for the CEO, the CGN Committee) determines the officer’s retirement is
detrimental to Dominion. Payout for an officer who retires or whose employment is terminated without cause, is made following the end of the performance period so that the officer is rewarded only to the extent the performance goals are achieved. In
the case of death or disability, payout is made as soon as possible to facilitate the administration of the officer’s estate or financial planning. The payout amount will be the greater of the officer’s target award or an amount based on
the predicted performance used for compensation cost disclosure purposes in Dominion’s financial statements.

In the event of a change in control, the performance grant is vested in its entirety and payout of the performance grant will occur as soon as administratively
feasible following the change in control date at an amount that is the greater of an officer’s target award or an amount based on the predicted performance used for compensation cost disclosure purposes in Dominion’s financial statements.

(4)

The 2011 restricted stock grant fully vests at the end of three years.
The restricted stock grant is forfeited in its entirety if an officer voluntarily terminates employment or is terminated with cause before the vesting date. The restricted stock grant provides for pro-rated vesting if an officer retires, dies,
becomes disabled, is terminated without cause, or if there is a change in control. In the case of retirement, pro-rated vesting will not occur if the CEO (or for the CEO, the CGN Committee) determines the officer’s retirement is detrimental to
Dominion. In the event of a change in control, pro-rated vesting is provided as of the change in control date, and full vesting if an officer’s employment is terminated, or constructively terminated by the successor entity following the change
in control date but before the scheduled vesting date. Dividends on the restricted shares are paid during the restricted period at the same rate declared by Dominion for all shareholders.

ENEFITS

The following table shows the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits payable to NEOs, together with the number of years of benefit service
credited to each NEO, under the plans listed in the table. Values are computed as of December 31, 2011, using the same interest rate and mortality assumptions used in determining the aggregate pension obligations disclosed in Dominion’s
financial statements. The years of credited service and the present value of accumulated benefits were determined by the plan actuaries, using the appropriate accrued service, pay and other assumptions similar to those used for accounting and
disclosure purposes. Please refer to

Actuarial Assumptions Used to Calculate Pension Benefits

for detailed information regarding these assumptions.

Note: The NEOs included in this table perform services for more than one subsidiary of Dominion. Amounts for the NEOs
listed in the table reflect only the applicable portion related to their service for Virginia Power.

(1)

Years of credited service shown in this column for the DPP are actual
years accrued by an NEO from his date of participation to December 31, 2011. Service for the BRP and the ESRP is the NEO’s actual credited service as of December 31, 2011 plus any potential total credited service to the plan maximum,
including any extra years of credited service granted to Messrs. Farrell and McGettrick by the CGN Committee for the purpose of calculating benefits under these plans. Please refer to the narrative below and under Dominion Executive Supplemental
Retirement Plan

and

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control for information about the requirements for receiving extra years of credited service and the amount credited, if any, for each NEO.

(2)

The amounts in this column are based on actuarial assumptions that all of
the NEOs would retire at the earliest age they become eligible for unreduced benefits, which is (i) age 60 for Messrs. Farrell, Koonce, Christian and Heacock, and (ii) age 55 for Mr. McGettrick (when he would be treated as age 60
based on his five additional years of credited age). In addition, for purposes of calculating the BRP benefits for Messrs. Farrell and McGettrick, the amounts reflect additional credited years of service granted to them pursuant to their agreements
with Dominion (see Dominion Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan). If the amounts in this column did not include the additional years of credited service, the present value of the BRP benefit would be $1,299,525 lower for Mr. Farrell, and
$1,403,744 lower for Mr. McGettrick. DPP and ESRP benefits amounts are not augmented by the additional service credit assumptions.



Dominion Pension Plan

The DPP is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. All of the NEOs participate in the DPP. The DPP provides unreduced retirement benefits at termination of employment at or after age 65 or, with
three years of service, at age 60. A participant who has attained age 55 with three years of service may elect early retirement benefits at a reduced amount. If a participant retires between ages 55 and 60, the benefit is reduced 0.25% per
month for each month after age 58 and before age 60, and reduced 0.50% per month for each month between ages 55 and 58. All of the NEOs have more than three years of service.

The DPP basic benefit is calculated using a formula based on (1) age at retirement; (2) final average earnings;
(3) estimated Social Security benefits; and (4) credited service. Final average earnings are the average of the participant’s 60 highest consecutive months of base pay during the last 120 months worked. Final average earnings do not
include compensation payable under the AIP, the value of equity awards, gains from the exercise of stock options, long-term cash incentive awards, perquisites or any other form of compensation other than base pay.

Credited service is measured in months, up to a maximum of 30 years of credited service. The estimated Social Security benefit taken into
account is the assumed Social Security benefit payable starting at age 65 or actual retirement date, if later, assuming that the participant has no further employment after leaving Dominion. These factors are then applied in a formula.

The formula has different percentages for credited service through December 31, 2000 and on and after January 1, 2001. The
benefit is the sum of the amounts from the following two formulas.

Credited service is limited to a total of 30 years for all parts of the formula and credited service after
2000 is limited to 30 years minus credited service before 2001.

Benefit payment options are (1) a single life annuity or
(2) a choice of a 50%, 75% or 100% joint and survivor annuity. A Social Security leveling option is available with any of the benefit forms. The normal form of benefit is a single life annuity for unmarried participants and a 50% joint and
survivor annuity for married participants. All of the payment options are actuarially equivalent in value to the single life annuity. The Social Security leveling option pays a larger benefit equal to the estimated Social Security benefit until the
participant is age 62 and then reduced payments after age 62.

The DPP also includes a special retirement account, which is in addition to the pension
benefit. The special retirement account is credited with 2% of base pay each month as well as interest based on the 30-year Treasury bond rate set annually (3.77% in 2011). The special retirement account can be paid in a lump sum or paid in the form
of an annuity benefit.

A participant becomes vested in his or her benefit after completing three years of service. A vested
participant who terminates employment before age 55 can start receiving benefit payments calculated using terminated vested reduction factors at any time after attaining age 55. If payments begin before age 65, then the following reduction factors
for the portion of the benefits earned after 2000 apply: age 64 – 9%; age 63 – 16%; age 62 – 23%; age 61 – 30%; age 60 – 35%; age 59 – 40%; age 58 – 44%; age 57 – 48%; age 56 – 52%; and age 55
– 55%.

The IRC limits the amount of compensation that may be included in determining pension benefits under qualified
pension plans. For 2011, the compensation limit was $245,000. The IRC also limits the total annual benefit that may be provided to a participant under a qualified defined benefit plan. For 2011, this limitation was the lesser of (i) $195,000 or
(ii) the average of the participant’s compensation during the three consecutive years in which the participant had the highest aggregate compensation.

Dominion Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan

The BRP is a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan
designed to make up for benefit reductions under the DPP due to the limits imposed by the IRC.

A Dominion employee is eligible
to participate in the BRP if (1) he or she is a member of management or a highly compensated employee, (2) his or her DPP benefit is or has been limited by the IRC compensation or benefit limits, and (3) he or she has been designated
as a participant by the CGN Committee. A participant remains a participant until he or she ceases to be eligible for any reason other than retirement or until his or her status as a participant is revoked by the CGN Committee.

Upon retirement, a participant’s BRP benefit is calculated using the same formula (except that the IRC salary limit is not applied)
used to determine the participant’s default annuity form of benefit under the DPP (single life annuity for unmarried participants and 50% joint and survivor annuity for married participants), and then subtracting the benefit the participant is
entitled to receive under the DPP. To accommodate the enactment of IRC Section 409A, the portion of a participant’s BRP benefit that had accrued as of December 31, 2004 is frozen, but the calculation of the overall restoration benefit
is not changed.

The restoration benefit is generally paid in the form of a single lump sum cash payment. However, a
participant may elect to receive a single life or 50% or 100% joint and survivor annuity for the portion of his or her benefit that accrued prior to 2005. For the portion of his or her benefit that accrued in 2005 or later, a participant may also
elect to receive a 75% joint and survivor annuity. The lump sum calculation includes an amount approximately equivalent to the amount of taxes the participant will owe on the lump sum payment so that the participant will have



sufficient funds, on an after-tax basis, to purchase an annuity contract.

A participant who terminates employment before he or she is eligible for benefits under the DPP generally is not entitled to a restoration
benefit. Messrs. Farrell and McGettrick have been granted age and service credits for purposes of calculating their DPP and BRP benefits. Per Mr. Farrell’s letter agreement, he was granted 25 years of service when he reached age 55 and
will continue to accrue service as long as he remains employed. At age 60, benefits will be calculated based on 30 years of service, if he remains employed. Mr. McGettrick, having attained age 50, has earned benefits calculated based on five
additional years of age and service. For each of these NEOs, the additional years of service count for determining both the amount of benefits and the eligibility to receive them. For additional information regarding service credits, see

Dominion
Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan

.

If a vested participant dies when he or she is retirement eligible (on or after
age 55), the participant’s beneficiary will receive the restoration benefit in a single lump sum payment. If a participant dies while employed but before he or she has attained age 55 and the participant is married at the time of death, the
participant’s spouse will receive a restoration benefit calculated in the same way as the 50% qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity payable under the DPP and paid in a lump sum payment.

Dominion Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan

The ESRP is a nonqualified defined benefit plan that provides for an annual retirement benefit equal to 25% of a participant’s final cash
compensation (base salary plus target annual incentive award) payable for a period of 10 years or, for certain participants designated by the CGN Committee, for the participant’s lifetime. To accommodate the enactment of IRC Section 409A,
the portion of a participant’s ESRP benefit that had accrued as of December 31, 2004 is frozen, but the calculation of the overall benefit is not changed.

A Dominion employee is eligible to participate in the ESRP if (1) he or she is a member of management or a highly compensated employee, and (2) he or she has been designated as a participant by
the CGN Committee. A participant remains a participant until he or she ceases to be eligible for any reason other than retirement or until his or her status as a participant is revoked by the CGN Committee.

A participant is entitled to the full ESRP benefit if he or she separates from service with Dominion after reaching age 55 and achieving
60 months of service. A participant who separates from service with Dominion with at least 60 months of service but who has not yet reached age 55 is entitled to a reduced, pro-rated retirement benefit. A participant who separates from service with
Dominion with fewer than 60 months of service is generally not entitled to an ESRP benefit unless the participant separated from service on account of disability or death. Effective December 1, 2006, officers who are participants must achieve
60 months of service as an officer to be eligible for the ESRP benefit.

The ESRP benefit is generally paid in the form of a
single lump sum cash payment. However, a participant may elect to receive the portion of his or her benefit that had accrued as of December 31, 2004 in monthly installments. For any new

participants, the ESRP benefit must be paid in the form of a single lump sum cash payment. The lump sum calculation includes an amount approximately equivalent to the amount of taxes the
participant will owe on the lump sum payment so that the participant will have sufficient funds, on an after-tax basis, to purchase a 10-year or lifetime annuity contract.

All of the NEOs except Mr. Koonce and Mr. Heacock are currently entitled to a full ESRP retirement benefit. If Mr. Koonce and Mr. Heacock terminate employment before attaining age 55,
they will receive a pro-rated ESRP benefit. Based on the terms of their individual letter agreements, Messrs. Farrell and Koonce will receive an ESRP benefit calculated as a lifetime benefit. Under the terms of his letter agreement,
Mr. McGettrick will earn a lifetime benefit under the ESRP if he remains employed until he attains age 55. Mr. McGettrick has earned five years of additional age and service credit for purposes of computing his retirement benefits and
eligibility for benefits under the ESRP, long-term incentive grants, and retiree medical and life insurance plans as he has met the requirement of remaining employed until he attained age 50. If Mr. McGettrick terminates employment before he
attains age 55, he will be deemed to have retired for purposes of determining his vesting credit under the terms of his restricted stock and performance grant awards. Mr. Christian will receive ESRP benefits calculated as a lifetime benefit
provided he remains employed with Dominion until attainment of age 60. As consideration for this benefit, Mr. Christian has agreed not to compete with Dominion for a two-year period following retirement. This agreement ensures that his
knowledge and services will not be available to competitors for two years following his retirement date.

Actuarial Assumptions Used to Calculate
Pension Benefits

Actuarial assumptions used to calculate DPP benefits are prescribed by the terms of the DPP based on IRC and PBGC
requirements. The present value of the accumulated benefit is calculated using actuarial and other factors as determined by the plan actuaries and approved by Dominion. Actuarial assumptions used for the December 31, 2011 benefit calculations
shown in the

Pension Benefits

table include a discount rate of 5.50% to determine the present value of the future benefit obligations for the DPP, BRP and ESRP and a lump sum interest rate of 4.75% to estimate the lump sum values of BRP and
ESRP benefits. Each NEO is assumed to retire at the earliest age at which he is projected to become eligible for full, unreduced pension benefits. Beginning with the 2009 calculations, for purposes of estimating future eligibility for unreduced DPP
and ESRP benefits, the effect of future service is considered. Each NEO is assumed to commence DPP payments at the same age as BRP payments. The longevity assumption used to determine the present value of benefits is the same assumption used for
financial reporting of the DPP liabilities, with no assumed mortality before retirement age. Assumed mortality after retirement is based on tables from the Society of Actuaries’ RP-2000 study, projected from 2000 to a point five years beyond
the calculation date (this year, to 2016) with 100% of the Scale AA factors, and further adjusted for Dominion experience by using an age set-forward factor. For BRP and ESRP benefits, other actuarial assumptions include an assumed tax rate of 42%.



BRP and ESRP benefits are assumed to be paid as lump sums; pension plan benefits are assumed to be paid as annuities.

The discount rate for calculating lump sum BRP and ESRP payments at the time an officer terminates employment is selected by Dominion’s Administrative Benefits Committee and adjusted periodically.
For year 2011, a 5.46% discount rate was used to determine the lump sum payout amounts. The discount rate for each year will be based on a rolling average of the blended rate published by the PBGC in October of the previous five years.

*No

preferential earnings are paid and therefore no earnings from these plans are included in the Summary Compensation Table.

At this time, Dominion does not offer any nonqualified elective deferred compensation plans to its officers or other employees. The

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

table reflects, in aggregate, the plan balances for two former plans offered to Dominion officers and other highly compensated employees: the Frozen Deferred Compensation Plan and the Frozen DSOP, which were
frozen as of December 31, 2004. Although the Frozen DSOP was an option plan rather than a deferred compensation plan, Dominion is including information regarding the plan and any balances in this table to make full disclosure about possible
future payments to officers under Dominion’s employee benefit plans.

Frozen Deferred Compensation Plan

The Frozen Deferred Compensation Plan includes amounts previously deferred from one of the following categories of compensation: (i) salary;
(ii) bonus; (iii) vesting restricted stock; and (iv) gains from stock option exercises. The plan also provided for company contributions of lost company 401(k) Plan match contributions and transfers from several CNG deferred
compensation plans. The Frozen Deferred Compensation Plan offers 27 investment funds for the plan balances, including a Dominion Stock Fund. Participants may change investment elections on any business day. Any vested restricted stock and gains from
stock option exercises that were deferred were automatically allocated to the Dominion Stock Fund and this allocation cannot be changed. Earnings are calculated based on the performance of the underlying investment fund.

The following funds had rates of returns for 2011 as follows: Dominion Resources Stock Fund, 29.37%; and Dominion Fixed Income Fund,
3.35%.

The Dominion Fixed Income Fund is an investment option that provides a fixed rate of return
each year based on a formula that is tied to the adjusted federal long-term rate published by the IRS in November prior to the beginning of the year. Dominion’s Asset Management Committee determines the rate based on its estimate of the rate of
return on Dominion assets in the trust for the Frozen Deferred Compensation Plan.

The default Benefit Commencement Date is
February 28 after the year in which the participant retires, but the participant may select a different Benefit Commencement Date in accordance with the plan. Participants may change their Benefit Commencement Date election; however, a new
election must be made at least six months before an existing Benefit Commencement Date. Withdrawals less than six months prior to an existing Benefit Commencement Date are subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Account balances must be fully
paid out no later than the February 28 that is 10 calendar years after a participant retires or becomes disabled. If a participant retires from Dominion, he or she may continue to defer an account balance provided that the total balance is
distributed by this deadline. In the event of termination of employment for reasons other than death, disability or retirement before an elected Benefit Commencement Date, benefit payments will be distributed in a lump sum as soon as
administratively practicable. Hardship distributions, prior to an elected Benefit Commencement Date, are available under certain limited circumstances.

Participants may elect to have their benefit paid in a lump sum payment or equal annual installments over a period of whole years from one to 10 years. Participants have the ability to change their
distribution schedule for benefits under the plan by giving six months notice to the plan administrator. Once a participant begins receiving annual installment payments, the participant can make a one-time election to either (1) receive the
remaining account balance in the form of a lump sum distribution or (2) change the remaining installment payment period. Any election must be approved by the company before it is effective. All distributions are made in cash with the exception
of the Deferred Restricted Stock Account and the Deferred Stock Option Account, which are distributed in the form of Dominion common stock.

Frozen
DSOP

The Frozen DSOP enabled employees to defer all or a portion of their salary and bonus and receive options on various mutual funds.
Participants also received lost company matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan in the form of options under this plan. DSOP options can be exercised at any time before their expiration date. On exercise, the participant receives the excess of the
value, if any, of the underlying mutual funds over the strike price. The participant can currently choose among options on 26 mutual funds, and there is not a Dominion stock alternative or a fixed income fund. Participants may change options among
the mutual funds on any business day. Benefits grow/decline based on the total return of the mutual funds selected. Any options that expire do not have any value. Options expire under the following terms:

Ÿ

Options expire on the last day of the 120th month after retirement or disability;

Ÿ

Options expire on the last day of the 24th month after the participant’s death (while employed);



Ÿ

Options expire on the last day of the 12th month after the participant’s severance;

Ÿ

Options expire on the 90th day after termination with cause; and

Ÿ

Options expire on the last day of the 120th month after severance following a change in control.

The NEO participating in the Frozen DSOP held options on the publicly available mutual fund, Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index, which had a
rate of return for 2011 of 2.96%.

Under certain circumstances, Dominion provides benefits
to eligible employees upon termination of employment, including a termination of employment involving a change in control of Dominion, that are in addition to termination benefits for other employees in the same situation.

Change in Control

As discussed in the

Employee
and Executive Benefits

section of the CD&A, Dominion has entered into an Employment Continuity Agreement with each of its officers, including the NEOs. Each agreement has a three-year term and is automatically extended annually for an
additional year, unless cancelled by Dominion.

The Employment Continuity Agreements require two triggers for the payment of
most benefits:

Ÿ

There must be a change in control; and

Ÿ

The executive must either be terminated without cause, or terminate his or her employment with the surviving company after a constructive termination.
Constructive termination means the executive’s salary, incentive compensation or job responsibility is reduced after a change in control or the executive’s work location is relocated more than 50 miles without his or her consent.

For purposes of the Employment Continuity Agreements, a change in control will occur if (i) any person
or group becomes a beneficial owner of 20% or more of the combined voting power of Dominion voting stock or (ii) as a direct or indirect result of, or in connection with, a cash tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination,
sale of assets, or contested election, the directors constituting the Dominion Board before any such transaction cease to represent a majority of Dominion’s or its successor’s Board within two years after the last of such transactions.

If an executive’s employment following a change in control is terminated without cause
or due to a constructive termination, the executive will become entitled to the following termination benefits:

Ÿ

Lump sum severance payment equal to three times base salary plus AIP award (determined as the greater of (i) the target annual award for the
current year or (ii) the highest actual AIP payout for any one of the three years preceding the year in which the change in control occurs).

Ÿ

Full vesting of benefits under ESRP and BRP with five years of additional credited age and five years of additional credited service from the change in
control date.

Ÿ

Group-term life insurance. If the officer elects to convert group-term insurance to an individual policy, the company pays the premiums for 12 months.

Ÿ

Executive life insurance. Premium payments will continue to be paid by Dominion until the earlier of: (1) the fifth anniversary of the termination
date, or (2) the later of the 10th anniversary of the policy or the date the officer attains age 64.

Ÿ

Retiree medical coverage will be determined under the relevant plan with additional age and service credited as provided under an officer’s letter
of agreement (if any) and including five additional years credited to age and five additional years credited to service.

Ÿ

Outplacement services for one year (up to $25,000).

Ÿ

If any payments are classified as excess parachute payments for purposes of IRC Section 280G and the executive incurs the excise tax, Dominion
will pay the executive an amount equal to the 280G excise tax plus a gross-up multiple.

The terms of awards
made under the LTIP, rather than the terms of Employment Continuity Agreements, will determine the vesting of each award in the event of a change in control. These provisions are described in the

Long-Term Incentive Program

section of the
CD&A and footnotes to the

Grants of Plan-Based Awards

table.

Other Post Employment Benefit for Mr. Farrell.

Mr. Farrell will become entitled to a payment of one times salary upon his retirement as consideration for his agreement not to compete with Dominion
for a two-year period following retirement. This agreement ensures that his knowledge and services will not be available to competitors for two years following his retirement date.



The following table provides the incremental payments that would be earned by each NEO if his employment had been terminated, or
constructively terminated, as of December 31, 2011. These benefits are in addition to retirement benefits that would be payable on any termination of employment. Please refer to the

Pension Benefits

table for information related to the
present value of accumulated retirement benefits payable to the NEOs.

Incremental Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

Note: The NEOs included in this table perform services for more than one subsidiary of Dominion. Amounts for the NEOs
listed in the table reflect only the applicable portion related to their service for Virginia Power.

(1)

Grants made in 2009, 2010 and 2011 under the LTIP vest prorated upon termination without cause, death or disability. These grants vest prorated upon
retirement provided the CEO of Dominion (or in the case of the CEO, the CGN Committee) determines the NEO’s retirement is not detrimental to Dominion; amounts shown assume this determination was made. However, the December 2010 restricted stock
award issued to Mr. Farrell does not vest prorated if Mr. Farrell is terminated or leaves for any reason other than following change of control, death or disability. The amounts shown in the restricted stock column are based on
Dominion’s closing stock price of $53.08 on December 30, 2011.

(2)

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 28, 2003,
Mr. Farrell will be entitled to a special payment of one times salary upon retirement in exchange for a two-year non-compete agreement. Mr. Farrell would not be entitled to this non-compete payment in the event of his death.

(3)

Amounts in this column represent the value of the incremental benefit the
NEOs would receive for executive life insurance and retiree medical coverage. Mr. McGettrick is eligible for retiree medical and executive life insurance upon any termination due to his letter agreement. Messrs. Farrell and Christian are
entitled to executive life insurance coverage and retiree medical benefit upon any termination since they are retirement eligible and have completed 10 years of service. Messrs. Koonce and Heacock are eligible for executive life insurance upon a
change in control. Mr. Heacock is eligible for retiree medical upon a change in control. Mr. Koonce would not be eligible for retiree medical upon a change in control because with an additional 5 years of age credit he would not reach the
required retiree medical age of 58. Retiree health benefits have been quantified using assumptions used for financial accounting purposes.

Related Party Transactions

Virginia Power’s Board of Directors has adopted the Related Party Guidelines also approved by Dominion’s Board of
Direc-

tors. These guidelines were adopted for the purpose of identifying potential conflicts of interest arising out of financial transactions, arrangements and relations between Virginia Power and any
related persons. Under the guidelines, a related person is a director, executive officer, director nominee, a beneficial owner of more than 5% of Dominion’s common stock, or any immediate family member of one of the foregoing persons. A related
party transaction is any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in excess of $120,000 in which Virginia Power
(and/or any of its consolidated subsidiaries) is a party and in which the related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

In determining whether a direct or indirect interest is material, the significance of the information to investors in light of all circumstances is considered. The importance of the interest to the person
having the interest, the relationship of the parties to the transaction with each other and the amount involved are also among the factors considered in determining the significance of the information to the investors.

Dominion’s CGN Committee has reviewed certain categories of transactions and determined that transactions between Dominion and a
related person that fall within such categories will not result in the related person receiving a direct or indirect material interest. Under the guidelines, such transactions are not deemed related party transactions and therefore not subject to
review by the CGN Committee. The categories of excluded transactions include, among other items, compensation and expense reimbursement paid to directors and executive officers in the ordinary course of performing their duties; transactions with
other companies where the related party’s only relationship is as an employee, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of that company’s gross revenues; and charitable contributions which are less
than the greater of $1 million or 2% of the charity’s annual receipts. The full text of the guidelines can be found on Dominion’s website at www.dom.com/investors/corporate-governance/pdf/related_party_guidelines.pdf.

Virginia Power collects information about potential related party transactions in its annual questionnaires completed by directors and
executive officers. Management reviews the potential related party transactions and assesses whether any of the identified transactions constitute a related party transaction. Any identified related party transactions are then reported to
Dominion’s CGN Committee. Dominion’s CGN Committee reviews and considers relevant facts and circumstances and determines whether to ratify or approve the related party transactions identified. Dominion’s CGN Committee may only approve
or ratify related party transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of Dominion and its shareholders and are in compliance with Virginia Power’s Code of Ethics.

Since January 1, 2011 there have been no related party transactions involving Virginia Power that were required either to be approved
under Virginia Power’s policies or reported under the SEC related party transactions rules.



Director Independence

Under NYSE listing standards, Messrs. Farrell, McGettrick and Rogers are not independent as they are executive officers of Virginia Power or of its parent company, Dominion. All of Virginia Power’s
outstanding common stock is owned by Dominion and therefore, Virginia Power is a “controlled” company under the rules of the NYSE. Because Virginia Power meets the definition of a “controlled company” and has only preferred stock
listed on the NYSE, it is exempt under Section 303A of the NYSE Rules from the provisions relating to board committees and the requirement to have a majority of its board be independent.

The following table presents fees paid to Deloitte & Touche LLP for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Audit Fees

represent fees of Deloitte & Touche LLP for the audit of
Virginia Power’s annual consolidated financial statements, the review of financial statements included in Virginia Power’s quarterly Form 10-Q reports, and the services that an independent auditor would customarily provide in connection
with subsidiary audits, statutory requirements, regulatory filings, and similar engagements for the fiscal year, such as comfort letters, attest services, consents, and assistance with review of documents filed with the SEC.

Audit-Related Fees

consist of assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review
of Virginia Power’s consolidated financial statements or internal control over financial reporting. This category may include fees related to the performance of audits and attest services not required by statute or regulations, due diligence
related to mergers, acquisitions, and investments, and accounting consultations about the application of GAAP to proposed transactions.

Virginia Power’s Board of Directors has adopted the Dominion Audit Committee pre-approval policy for its independent auditor’s services and fees and has delegated the execution of this policy to
the Dominion Audit Committee. In accordance with this delegation, each year the Dominion Audit Committee pre-approves a schedule that details the services to be provided for the following year and an estimated charge for such services. At its
December 2011 and January 2012 meetings, the Dominion Audit Committee approved Virginia Power’s schedule of services and fees for 2012. In accordance with the pre-approval policy, any changes to the pre-approved schedule may be pre-approved by
the Dominion Audit Committee or a member of the Dominion Audit Committee.
