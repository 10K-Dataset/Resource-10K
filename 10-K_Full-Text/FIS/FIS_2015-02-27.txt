Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS employs more than 40,000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing and banking solutions.

®

Index.

FIS is incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia as Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "FIS".

We help clients address and solve their critical and challenging business and technology problems by leveraging the breadth and depth of our software applications and services, our collective experience, our broad range of successful methodologies and our global scale.  We have grown organically as well as through acquisitions, which have contributed applications and service expansion capabilities that complement or enhance our existing offerings and diversify our revenues by clients, geography and service offering.  These acquired offerings include integrated consulting services, integrated core banking and payment solutions, mobile banking solutions, wealth management services,  item processing services, card issuer services, risk management solutions, electronic loan amendment applications and services, electronic funds transfer ("EFT") services, and prepaid/gift card processing for all sizes of financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions.  Many of these solutions are also sold to other commercial businesses. These strategic acquisitions have enabled us to broaden our available solution sets, scale our operations, develop our global consulting expertise, expand and diversify our client base and strengthen our competitive position.  We continue to invest in our solutions and services, looking to innovate and enhance them to deliver more value to our clients.

Financial Information About Operating Segments and Geographic Areas

During the periods presented, we operated our business in four reporting segments: 1) Financial Solutions Group (“FSG”); 2) Payment Solutions Group (“PSG”); 3) International Solutions Group (“ISG”); and 4) Corporate and Other.  In December 2014, we announced the promotion of Gary Norcross to Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2015.  In 2015, we have made a number of other organizational changes designed to align our services and solutions with their best market opportunity.  How we allocate resources and analyze performance in the new structure may result in a change in our reportable segments

.

Competitive Strengths

We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:

•

Brand

— FIS has built a global brand known for market leading solutions, innovation and thought leadership in the financial services sector.  Capco likewise has a strong brand in integrated consulting and advisory technology strategy and services in this sector.

•

Global Reach, Distribution and Scale —

Our worldwide presence, breadth and depth of solution offerings, client diversity, established infrastructure and employee skills and competencies enable us to leverage our client relationships and global scale to drive revenue growth and operating efficiency.   We are a global leader in the primary markets we serve, supported by a large, knowledgeable talent pool of employees around the world.

•

Extensive Domain Expertise and Portfolio Depth

— FIS has a significant number and wide range of high-quality software applications and service offerings that have been developed over many years with substantial input from our clients.  We leverage our industry and technology knowledge and experience to tailor these applications and service offerings to deliver comprehensive business solutions that address  specific  needs of our clients and our clients' customers.  These solutions include a wide range of flexible service arrangements for the deployment and support of our software, from cloud-based offerings to managed processing arrangements to traditional license and maintenance



approaches, either at the client’s site or at an FIS location.  Our broad solution set allows us to bundle tailored and/or integrated solutions to compete effectively. In addition, FIS is able to use the modular nature of our software applications and our ability to integrate many of our applications and services with the solutions of others to provide customized solutions that respond to individualized client  needs.  We understand the needs of our clients and their customers and have developed innovative solutions that we believe give them a competitive advantage, reducing their operating costs and improving their productivity.

•

Excellent Relationship with Clients

— Our client-centered approach has enabled us to establish deep and long-lasting client relationships.   A significant percentage of FIS’ services are provided under multi-year, recurring contracts, which allows us to develop close partnerships with these clients resulting in high client retention rates.  As the breadth and value proposition of FIS’ service offerings has expanded, our access to our clients’ executives and their interest in our solutions and services has increased, presenting greater opportunities for cross-selling and upselling broader integrated solutions to them.

Strategy

Our mission is to provide our clients with superior solutions and services, which we believe will assist our clients in their respective marketplaces and will result in sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strategy to achieve this goal has been and continues to be built on the following pillars:

•

Support Our Clients Through Transformation

— Changing market dynamics, particularly in the areas of information security, regulation and innovation, are transforming the way our clients operate, which is driving incremental demand for our leveraged solutions and consulting expertise.  As clients evaluate technology, business process changes and vendor risks, our depth of services capabilities enables us to become involved earlier in their planning and design process and assist them as they manage through these changes.

•

Expand Client Relationships

—  The overall market

we serve

continues to gravitate beyond single-product purchases to multi-solution partnerships.  As the market dynamics shift, our clients may rely more on our multidimensional, integrated service offerings.  Our leveraged solutions and processing expertise, along with our consulting and advisory services, can produce meaningful value and cost savings for our clients through more efficient operating processes, improved experience and service quality and convenience for our clients' customers.

•

Build , Buy, or Partner to Add Solutions to Cross-Sell

— We continue to invest in growth through internal product development, as well as through product-focused or market-centric acquisitions and equity investments that complement and extend our existing solutions and capabilities, providing us with additional solutions to cross-sell.  We also partner from time to time with other entities to provide comprehensive offerings to our clients.  By investing in solution innovation and integration, we continue to expand our value proposition to clients.

•

Continually Improve to Drive Margin Expansion

— We strive to optimize our performance through investments in infrastructure enhancements, our workforce and other measures that are designed to create organic revenue and margin expansion.

•

Build Global Diversification

—  We continue to deploy resources in global markets where we expect to achieve meaningful scale.

Revenues by Segment

The table below summarizes our revenues by reporting segment (in millions):

Financial Solutions Group

The focus of FSG is to provide comprehensive services and software to satisfy the processing, technology,  and outsourcing needs of our financial institution clients in North America. We service the core and related ancillary processing



needs of North American banks, credit unions, automotive financial companies, commercial lenders, and independent community and savings institutions. The FSG segment offers a broad selection of in-house and outsourced solutions to banking clients that span the range of asset sizes. FSG clients typically commit to multi-year contracts that provide a stable, recurring revenue base and opportunities for cross-selling additional financial and payments offerings.

We employ several business models to provide our solutions to our clients. We typically deliver the highest value to our clients when we combine our software applications and deliver them in one of several types of outsourcing arrangements, such as cloud-based provider, application service provider, through facilities management processing or by an application management arrangement. We are also able to deliver individual applications through a software licensing arrangement. Based upon our expertise gained through the foregoing arrangements, some clients also retain us to manage their IT operations with or without using any of our proprietary software.  We also provide strategic consulting services that help financial institutions define and manage their technology strategies and projects.

Our solutions in this segment include:

•

Core Processing and Ancillary Applications.

Our core processing software applications are designed to run banking processes for our financial institution clients, including deposit and lending systems, customer management, and other central management systems, serving as the system of record for processed activity.  Our diverse selection of market-focused core systems enables FIS to compete effectively in a wide range of markets. We also offer a number of services that are ancillary to the primary applications listed above, including branch automation, back office support systems and compliance support. In addition, our wealth management services address the specific needs of the affluent markets as well as commercial clients.  We also offer an application suite that assists automotive finance institutions in evaluating loan applications and credit risk and managing their loan and lease portfolios.

•

Channel Solutions, including Internet, Mobile and eBanking.

Our comprehensive suite of retail banking delivery applications enables financial institutions to integrate and streamline customer-facing operations and back-office processes, thereby improving customer interaction across all channels (e.g., branch offices, Internet, ATM, Mobile, call centers). FIS' focus on consumer access has driven significant market innovation in this area, with multi-channel and multi-host solutions and a strategy that provides tight integration of services and a seamless customer experience. FIS is a leader in mobile banking solutions and electronic banking enabling clients to manage banking and payments through the Internet, mobile devices and telephone. Our corporate electronic banking solutions provide commercial treasury capabilities including cash management services and multi-bank collection and disbursement services that address the specialized needs of corporate clients. FIS systems provide full accounting and reconciliation for such transactions, serving here also as the system of record.

•

Fraud, Risk Management and Compliance Solutions.

Our decision solutions offer a spectrum of options that cover the account lifecycle from helping to identify qualified account applicants to managing existing customer accounts and fraud. Our applications include know-your-customer, new account decisioning and opening, account and transaction management, fraud management and collections. Our risk management services use our proprietary risk management models and data sources to assist in detecting fraud and assessing the risk of opening a new account or accepting a check at either the point-of-sale, a physical branch location, or through the Internet. Our systems use a combination of advanced authentication procedures, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence modeling and proprietary and shared databases to assess and detect fraud risk for deposit transactions for financial institutions.  We also provide outsourced risk management and compliance solutions that are configurable to a client's regulatory and risk management requirements.

•

Syndicated Lending.

Our syndicated loan applications are designed to support wholesale and commercial banking requirements necessary for all aspects of syndicated commercial loan origination, amendment, trade and servicing.

•

Global Commercial Services.

As our clients address their financial, regulatory, growth and security challenges, there is an increased trend toward outsourcing. Our global commercial services include solutions, both onshore and offshore, designed to meet the technology challenges facing clients, large or small, including financial institutions and non-financial institutions. These solutions range in scope from consulting engagements to application development projects and from operations support for a single application to full management of information technology infrastructures. We also provide outsourcing teams to manage costs, improve operational efficiency and transform our clients' back office and customer service processes.

•

Strategic Consulting Services.

Capco's North American operations are included in FSG.  Capco provides complex integrated consulting and advisory, technology and large-scale IT transformation services to financial institutions.



Capco consultants work with financial institutions to design and implement improvements in their information technology architecture, providing design, digital strategy consulting, program and change management and delivery services. Global financial institutions in particular can benefit from the combination of Capco's expertise with FIS' broad solution set as they transform in the evolving marketplace to restore customer confidence, reduce their cost structure and provide innovative solutions to their customers.

®

branded credit and debit cards or other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts.

We offer Europay, MasterCard and VISA ("EMV") integrated circuit cards, often referred to as smart cards or chip cards, as well as a variety of stored-value card types and loyalty/reward programs.  Our integrated services range from card production and activation to processing to an extensive range of fraud management services and value-added loyalty programs designed to increase card usage and fee-based revenues for financial institutions and merchants.

Our extensive solutions include distributed (i.e., non-centralized) data capture, mobile deposit capture, check and remittance processing, fraud detection, and document and report management. Clients encompass banks and corporations of all sizes, from de novo banks to the largest financial institutions and corporations.

Our check authorization system uses artificial intelligence modeling and other state-of-the-art technology to deliver accuracy, convenience and simplicity to retailers.  Our closed loop gift card solutions and loyalty programs provide merchants compelling solutions to drive consumer loyalty.

International Solutions Group

The services delivered by FIS in these locations include many of the same financial and payments solutions we offer in North America. We provide core banking applications, channel solutions, debit/credit/and prepaid card and merchant services, wealth management services, item processing and check risk management solutions to financial institutions, card issuers, commercial enterprises and government operations.

Banking and Payments Services.

Our international operations leverage existing applications and provide services for the specific business needs of our clients in targeted international markets. Services are delivered from multiple operations centers around the world.

Strategic Consulting Services.

Capco's operations outside of North America are included in ISG, providing the same integrated consulting described above under FSG.

ISG represented approximately

22%

of total


revenues, with potential for both growth in existing client accounts and new account penetration.  Management believes the greatest potential for growth is in the Western European, Latin American and Asian markets.   Our Brazilian joint venture partner, Banco Bradesco, is our largest ISG client and was responsible for

20%

of ISG revenue in 2014 --See Related Party Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Corporate and Other Segment

The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate overhead and costs of leveraged functions that are not allocated to operating segments. These costs relate to domestic sales and marketing, finance and accounting, risk management and information security, human resources, legal, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates revenue generating segment performance.

Sales and Marketing

We see a trend in the buying behavior of financial services sector clients away from single products and toward integrated solutions that best suit a particular market of clients.  We have experienced sales personnel with expertise in particular services and markets as well as in the needs of particular types of clients. We believe that focusing our expertise in specific markets (e.g., global financial institutions, North American financial institutions) and tailoring integrated solution sets of particular value to participants in those markets will enable us to deliver better value to our clients and also help us leverage opportunities to cross-sell and up-sell. As a result, in 2014 we realigned our sales teams to better match our solution expertise with the market opportunity and client demand.  In 2014, we hired additional personnel with a specific focus on global financial institutions and



we expect to sustain and continue to invest in this market initiative.  We target the majority of our potential clients via direct and/or indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound lead generation and telesales efforts.

Our global marketing strategy is to develop and lead the execution of the FSG, PSG, and ISG strategic marketing plans in support of their revenue and profitability goals and the FIS brand.  Key components include thought leadership, integrated programs with consistent message development, internal and external communications, client conference content management, web content creation and management, trade shows, demand generation campaigns  and collateral development and management.  We leverage our sales and marketing teams across North America, selling both PSG and FSG solutions.  Internationally, we have a regional sales and marketing coverage model.  For large strategic clients, we further designate an engagement partner to manage the relationship and identify sales opportunities.

Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

The Company owns intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights and patents, that we believe are  important to our future success.  We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, copyrights and applicable law to establish and protect our software, technology and expertise worldwide. We rely on trademark law to protect our rights in those brands. We intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including by legal action when necessary and appropriate. In general, we own the proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our business, although we do license certain items from third parties under arms-length agreements for varying terms.

Competition

Our primary competitors include internal technology departments within financial institutions and retailers, data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers, companies that deliver software and integrated services to the financial services industry, third-party payment processors, independent computer services firms, companies that develop and deploy software applications, companies that provide customized development, implementation and support services, strategic consulting and technology consulting firms, and business process outsourcing companies. Some of these competitors possess greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. Competitive factors impacting the success of our services include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, the ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services, price and overall relationship management. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. In addition, we believe that our financial services industry expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated solutions to individual clients, enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings.

In addition, our external competition continues to grow as international providers seek to bring their core processing and related products to the North American market.  In this market we compete with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Fiserv, Inc., Jack Henry and Associates, Inc., Accenture Ltd., Alliance Data Systems Corporation, DST Systems, D+H Corporation, CSI, COCC, SAP, Black Knight Financial Services, CSC, SEI Investments Company, ACI Worldwide, SunGard Data Systems, Inc. and certain competitors in international markets have shown an increased presence in North America, including Oracle Financial Services Software Limited (formerly known as I-Flex Solutions Limited), Misys plc, Infosys Technologies and Temenos Group AG while others for now compete primarily in international markets, such as Alnova Technologies Corporation, Atos, TATA Capital and Polaris Technologies.  A number of these competitors also provide ancillary financial and product solutions.  Our competitors in the card services market include MasterCard Incorporated, Visa Inc., and third-party credit and debit card processors, such as First Data Corporation, Vantiv, Total System Services, Inc., HP Enterprise Services and Payment Systems for Credit Unions (PSCU). New non-traditional payments competitors include Apple, Google and Paypal. Competitors in the check risk management services market include First Data Corporation’s TeleCheck Services division, Heartland Payment Systems, Inc., Total Systems Services, Inc. and Global Payments, Inc.

Research and Development

Our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure. In addition, we intend to offer services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels.



As part of our research and development process, we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components. Where appropriate, we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. In the case of nearly all of our third-party software, enterprise license agreements exist for the third-party component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply.  As a result, we are not materially dependent upon any third-party technology components. Third-party software may be used for highly specialized business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints.  Additionally, third-party software may be used for commodity-type functions within a technology platform environment. We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services. In each of the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, approximately 2% to 3% of revenues were invested in research and development efforts.

Government Regulation

Our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal, state, and foreign regulation, including federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, Regulation AA (Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices), privacy laws, usury laws, laws governing state trust charters, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The compliance of our services and applications with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors, including the manner in which our clients use them. Our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts. The failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them, as well as the imposition of civil fines and/or criminal penalties. The principal areas of regulation impacting our business are:

•

Oversight by Banking  Regulators.

As a provider of electronic data processing and back-office services to financial institutions, FIS is subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC"), an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities as part of the Multi-Region Data Processing Servicer Program ("MDPS").  The MDPS program includes technology suppliers who provide mission critical applications for a large number of financial institutions that are regulated by multiple regulatory agencies. Periodic information technology examination assessments are performed using FFIEC Interagency guidelines to identify potential risks that could adversely affect serviced financial institutions, determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations that affect the services provided to financial institutions and ensure the services we provide to financial institutions do not create systemic risk to the banking system or impact the safe and sound operation of the financial institutions we process. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients’ auditors and regulators. We are also subject to review under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above, including electronic data processing and back-office services for financial institutions and the use of consumer information. Our U.S. based wealth management business holds charters in the states of Georgia and Delaware which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance and the Office of the Commissioner of Banking in the State of Delaware. In addition, our Platform Securities, LLC subsidiary in the U.K. is subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") as a custodian involved in the safeguarding and administration of assets of its professional and retail customers.  The FCA has increased regulatory mandate under U.K. law effective April 1, 2014 and other businesses of ours in the U.K. will become subject to regulation under the FCA in the coming year.

•

Privacy.

Our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These regulations place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves.

•

Money Transfer.

Elements of our cash access and money transmission businesses are registered as a Money Services Business and are subject to the USA Patriot Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. Treasury Regulations. These businesses may also be subject to certain state, local and tribal licensing requirements. The



Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission and the sale of stored value cards to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdiction's banking department.

•

Consumer Reporting and Protection.

Our retail check authorization services (Certegy Check Services) and account opening services, including credit scoring analysis (ChexSystems) maintain databases of consumer information and, as a consequence, are subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state laws. Among other things, the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes requirements on us concerning data accuracy, and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their files, to dispute their accuracy, and to require verification or removal of disputed information.  The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy, fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers’ personal information, and compliance with these laws, we strive to, and have made considerable investment to, maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling disputes.   We also are focused on ensuring our operating environments safeguard and protect consumer's personal information in compliance with these laws.

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted and signed into law on July 21, 2010.   Among other provisions, this legislation created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), whose sole focus is to develop, implement and, with respect to financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, enforce consumer protection rules promulgated by the CFPB, including enhanced oversight of non-financial institutions providing financial services.  For financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, enforcement of the rules will be carried out by such institution's primary federal regulator.  Certain of our businesses that affect end consumers are subject to examination by these regulators from time to time.

Our consumer reporting and facing businesses are subject to CFPB bulletin 2013-7 an update to the former Regulation A- Unfair Deceptive Acts or Practices, which states the definition of Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices (UDAAP).  This specific bulletin states that UDAAPs can cause significant financial injury to consumers, erode consumer confidence, and undermine fair competition in the financial marketplace. Original creditors and other covered persons and service providers under the Dodd-Frank Act involved in collecting debt related to any consumer financial product or service are subject to the prohibition against UDAAPs in the Dodd-Frank Act.

•

Debt Collection.

Our collection services supporting our check, card and payment environments are subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements. The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.

The foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our Company is subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously.  Enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly and indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and/or loss of revenue.

Information Security

Globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication.  Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities.  The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public, sensitive information.  FIS is not immune to such attacks.  As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including but not limited to sensitive information of our clients and personal consumer data.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Business and Operations

Entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients.

There has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry.  In addition, many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results, including some of our clients, have failed.  These consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients, which could adversely affect our revenues, even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities. Further, if our clients fail and/or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce use of our services. It is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new clients for our services.

The markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards. Our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services, and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers. These initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery, and performance issues. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing, marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands, that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, and marketing of these services, or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues and/or business prospects.

We operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

The market for our services is intensely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. Some of our competitors have substantial resources. We face direct competition from third parties, and since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications in-house and therefore view their system requirements from a make-versus-buy perspective, we often compete against our potential clients’ in-house capacities. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  See "Item I. Business. Competition."



Global economic, political and other conditions, including business cycles and consumer confidence, may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending, which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees. The global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. Any change in economic factors, including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence, particularly in the United States, or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending, including related consumer debt, reduce check writing and change credit and debit card usage, and as a result, adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service.

Constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution clients' ability to purchase our services, impacting our future growth and profitability.

A significant number of our clients and potential clients may hold sovereign debt of economically struggling nations or be subject to emerging international requirements such as Basel III, which could require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services. These potential constraints could alter the ability of clients or potential clients to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability.

Potential clients may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor, which may adversely affect our growth.

For banks and other potential clients of our financial information software and services, switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services (or from an internally-developed system) to a new vendor is a significant undertaking. Many potential clients perceive potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality, increased costs (including conversion costs) and business disruption. As a result, potential clients may resist change. We seek to overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such as a defined conversion process, system integration including bundling additional services and making ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our software. However, there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential clients’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful, and this resistance may adversely affect our growth.

The sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our clients and FIS.  If we fail to close sales or if a client chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.

The sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our clients and/or FIS. Potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time, effort, and money educating them prior to sales.  Further, as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services, clients may also require FIS to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs. All of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and, ultimately, the client may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation. If we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the client decides not to complete an implementation after we expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition.

We may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our larger clients. Larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract, when a contract is extended, or when the client's business has significant volume changes. They may also reduce services if they decide to move services in-house.  Further, our smaller and mid-size clients may exert pricing pressure due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client.  On some occasions, this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client. This reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Further, failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business. Our contracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for early termination fees. Term



s are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contract's term. If we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We may experience defects, development delays, installation difficulties, system failure, or other service disruptions with respect to our technology solutions, or execution problems with our transformation services, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability.

Many of our services, including our transformation services, are based on sophisticated software and computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services. Further, the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation.  Finally, our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses. Defects in our technology solutions, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions, or other difficulties could result in: (i) interruption of business operations; (ii) delay in market acceptance; (iii) additional development and remediation costs; (iv) diversion of technical and other resources; (v) loss of clients; (vi) negative publicity; or (vii) exposure to liability claims.  Any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls, including system redundancies, security controls, application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitation-of-liability provisions in our license and client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability.

The Dodd-Frank Act may result in business changes for our clients that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, or prospects for future growth and overall business

.

Our clients, and as a result our associated software and services, are required to comply with numerous regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Act and associated Durbin Amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010.  The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the United States.  The Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations, which have the potential to increase the amount and types of regulation on areas of our business that were not previously regulated.

Several new regulations and rules will be written and implemented as directed by the aforementioned legislation.  These new rules and regulations will require our clients or potential clients to comply with new requirements and could require us to directly comply with new regulations. These new requirements could result in the need for FIS to make capital investments to modify our products and services to facilitate our clients' and potential clients' compliance, as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with new regulations.  Further, requirements of the new regulations could result in changes in our clients' business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers, which could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients.  As a result, these new requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business.

Many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our clients engage and, therefore, reduces our revenues.

Our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply. Our clients must ensure that our services and related products work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them. Federal, state, foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws, rules or regulations affecting our clients' businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our products and services, possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance.   In addition, action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability, data usage, privacy, or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Regulations enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may require FIS to enact new business practices which may require capital investment and/or incremental expenses which could impact our future operating results.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulates financial and non-financial institutions and providers to those organizations.  The CFPB is establishing its regulatory agenda and will likely pass additional rules for regulating non-financial institution providers to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive



business practices.  The impact of these rules may require FIS or its subsidiaries to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices that could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results.

Our revenues from the sale of services to members of VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship, and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business.

In order to provide our card processing services, we must be certified (including applicable sponsorship) by VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and other similar organizations. These certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks. The member financial institutions, some of which are our competitors, set the standards with which we must comply. If we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined, our certifications could be suspended, or our registration could be terminated. The suspension or termination of our certifications, or any changes in the rules and regulations governing VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, or other similar organizations, could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations.

From time to time, card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge. It is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. Furthermore, the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements. Any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes.

Interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide.  The resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide.  Such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our clients.  See "Item I. Business. Government Regulation" for more information.

If we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted.

The majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to Federal or State regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. However, as a provider of services to these financial institutions, our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities and by international regulatory authorities, such as the FCA, in certain jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider, we could be subject to regulatory actions or regulatory rating changes, may not meet contractual obligations, or suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation.  Failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the Federal, State or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing clients or obtain new clients, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition to our data processing services described above, we also have business operations that store, process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and applicable privacy requirements.  Further, our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines, penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Security breaches or attacks, or our failure to comply with information security laws, or regulations or industry security requirements, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts.

We electronically receive, process, store and transmit sensitive business information of our clients.  In addition, we collect personal consumer data, such as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, cardholder data and payment history records.  Such information is necessary to support our clients' transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses.  The uninterrupted operation of our information systems, as well as the confidentiality



of the customer/consumer information that resides on such systems, is critical to our successful operation.  If we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure, adapt to emerging security threats, or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches, the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised.  Unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information, the deletion or modification of records, or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations.  These risks are greater with increased information transmission over the Internet and the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals.

Our risk management and information security programs are the subject of ongoing review by the federal regulatory agencies with responsibility for oversight of our business.  In late April 2014, the federal agencies that provide regulatory oversight for FIS issued a confidential report related to their examination of our information security, risk management and internal audit functions between October 2012 and October 2013.  We responded to the report and described the actions that we have taken, as well as ongoing efforts underway to address specific findings.  The regulatory agencies distributed the report, and a cover letter, to a subset of our regulated clients beginning in May 2014.   This prompted inquiries from clients, which, to the extent permitted by federal regulation, FIS has addressed on an individual basis.  We are unable to predict with certainty what, if any, further communications our regulators will have with our regulated financial institution clients.  We are also unable to predict the effect that any such communications may have on our business.  It remains possible that future actions by our regulators or clients related to this matter could have a material adverse impact on our business.

As a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services, we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our clients as apply to the clients themselves.  If we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract, governmental proceedings, the imposition of fines, or prohibitions on card processing services.  In addition, if more restrictive privacy laws, rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level, or by a specific industry body, they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes.  Any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches, or the perception that such breaches may occur, could cause our existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us, inhibit our ability to attract new clients, result in increasing regulation, or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business.

High profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes.

We are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur, whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service.  If consumers transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies, it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and related earnings.

Misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position.

Our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult. We cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. Effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online. Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

If our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties.

As our information technology applications and services develop, we are increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any claims, whether with or without merit, could: (i) be expensive and time-consuming to defend; (ii) result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; (iii) require us to redesign our applications, if feasible; (iv) divert management’s attention and resources; and (v) require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use.

We face liability to our merchant clients if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank.



If  checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writers' banks, we must reimburse our merchant clients for the checks' face value and pursue collection from the check writers. In some cases, we recognize a liability to our merchant clients for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers, based on historical experience and other relevant factors. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered by us may be less than our estimates.  Changes in economic conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our clients and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts.

Lack of system integrity, fraudulent payments, credit quality, undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss.

We settle funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. Transactions facilitated by us include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment transactions, banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers, financial institutions and other businesses. These payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties, the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments. If our continuity of operations, integrity of processing, or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised, this could result in a financial loss to us. In addition, we rely on various financial institutions to provide ACH services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products. If we are unable to obtain such ACH services in the future, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, we may issue credit to consumers, financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement. A default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us.  Furthermore, if one of our clients for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls, we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss.

Failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in the operation of our wealth management businesses in the U.S and the U.K could have adverse liability consequences.

We have wealth management businesses in the U.S. and U.K. engaged in processing securities transactions on behalf of clients and serving as a custodian.   Failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in those operations and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the potential for and magnitude of resulting losses, including those that may arise from human errors or omissions, defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems or  breakdowns in processes or in internal controls.  Human errors or omissions may include failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures, theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties.

In addition, the U.S. based business holds charters in the states of Georgia and Delaware which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance and the Office of the Commissioner of Banking in the State of Delaware.  The U.S. wealth management business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulators in the states in which they hold a bank or trust charter (Delaware and Georgia).  In the U.K., our Platform Securities business is regulated by the FCA and is subject to further regulatory capital requirements.

We have business in emerging markets such as Brazil, India and Southeast Asia.  These emerging markets may experience significant economic volatility in the future, which could add volatility to our revenue and earnings.

In our ISG segment, we have operations in emerging markets, primarily in Brazil, India and Southeast Asia.  These emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in North America and Europe, which could add volatility to our future revenues and earnings.

Our business is subject to the risks of international operations, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our international operations represent approximately

22%

of total


revenues, which are largely conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Euro and Indian Rupee. As a result, our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), differences in business practices and changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies. In addition, we are less well-known internationally than in the United States, have less experience with local business conditions and may face



challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters, because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance.

As we expand our international operations, more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. Dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in Brazil, Europe, Australia and parts of Asia. The U.S. Dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations, the periodic conversion of foreign-denominated earnings to the U.S. Dollar (our reporting currency), our results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  These risks could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow.

Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled technical personnel. Because the development of our products and services requires knowledge of computer hardware, operating system software, system management software and application software, our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines. Competition for such technical personnel is intense, and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Our future growth will also require sales and marketing, financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new products and services, to enhance and support current products and services and to expand operational and financial systems. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion.

Our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance, security, risk and audit professionals.  Competition for such skillsets is intense, and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results.

Our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry, either at FIS or with clients or competitors, and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  Further, the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior management's ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the Company, which could impact our future business, operating results and financial condition.

We are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.

We are involved in various litigation matters, including in some cases class-action and patent infringement litigation.  If we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters, we may be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense.

Our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by Federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, and could negatively impact our effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the current and/or future periods.  Unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in these negative impacts.

Risks Related to Business Combinations and Ventures

We have a substantial investment in our Brazilian Venture and obtain significant revenue through that venture that would be lost and result in significant termination costs if our venture partner were to terminate the agreement.

Revenue attributable to our Brazilian Venture partner, Banco Bradesco, accounted for

$277.4 million

in


.  The contract that we have with our Brazilian Venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract at any point during the 10-year term, which ends September 30, 2020.  This risk of contract termination is reduced by guaranteed performance targets and minimum payments that would be triggered upon the event of an early termination. These payments



have been established based on FIS' expected rate of return for the contract over a 10-year period.  The required payments and buyouts decline each year and are further reduced by returns in excess of the expected returns for the contract and reduce the overall barrier to exiting the venture.  If our partner were to exit the agreement, this could have a significant impact on our future revenue and growth.  For further detail on our Brazilian Venture see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Additionally, we employ approximately 10,000 employees in Brazil who would have the ability to file labor claims if their employment is terminated.  If our Brazilian Venture partner were to terminate the agreement, we, and they, may be subject to labor claims filed by employees of the Brazilian Venture.  These claims, if realized, could result in a significant cost and impact to our earnings.

We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions, and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring write-downs that would reduce our operating income.

As of

December 31, 2014

, goodwill aggregated to

$8,877.6 million

, or

61.1%

of total assets, and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to

$82.3 million

, or

0.6%

of total assets. Current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends. The results of our


annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the Company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units, and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of

December 31, 2014

.  Likewise, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was also in excess of the carrying value of those assets as of December 31, 2014.  However, if worldwide or United States economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior

,

or if other business or market changes impact our outlook

,

the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

As of

December 31, 2014

, intangible assets with finite useful lives aggregated to

$1,185.7 million

, or

8.2%

of total assets. Current accounting rules require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends.

We will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods.

Risks Related to our Indebtedness

Losses, consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements.

Some financial institutions continue to be challenged by negative operating results. In certain cases, these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures and/or consolidations. As a result, lenders may become insolvent, which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our revolving loan, obtain financing on favorable terms, or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our revolving loan or obtain other cost-effective financing.

Our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had total debt of approximately

$5,067.7 million

. This level of debt could have adverse consequences for our business, financial condition, operating results and operational flexibility, including the following: (i) the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; (ii) our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and



implement certain business strategies; (iii) some of our debt has a variable rate of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates; (iv) we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition and

vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions

; (v) there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to fulfill or that may be refinanced at higher rates; and (vi)

if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes, or our credit facility, an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable.

The covenants relating to our notes and the FIS Credit Agreement are limited and do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt or taking other actions that could exacerbate the risks described in the preceding risk factor or otherwise negatively impact holders of our notes.

We may be able to incur substantially more debt in the future. Although the indenture governing certain of our Notes and the agreements governing the FIS Credit Agreement (as both are defined in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) each contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. As of

December 31, 2014

, we had approximately

$2,204.2 million

of borrowing capacity available under our existing FIS Credit Agreement. To the extent new debt is added to our current levels, the risks described above could substantially increase.

Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various pending and threatened litigation matters related to operations, some of which include claims for punitive or exemplary damages. The Company believes that no actions, other than the matters listed below, depart from customary litigation incidental to its business. As background to the disclosure below, please note the following:

•

These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities.

•

The Company reviews all of its litigation on an on-going basis and follows the authoritative provisions for accounting for contingencies when making accrual and disclosure decisions. A liability must be accrued if (a) it is probable that a liability has been incurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If one of these criteria has not been met, disclosure is required when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may be incurred. When assessing reasonably possible and probable outcomes, the Company bases decisions on the assessment of the ultimate outcome following all appeals. Legal fees associated with defending litigation matters are expensed as incurred.

CheckFree Corporation and CashEdge, Inc. v. Metavante Corporation and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

This is a patent infringement action that was filed by CheckFree Corporation and CashEdge, Inc., subsidiaries of Fiserv, Inc. (collectively, the "Plaintiffs") against Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and our subsidiary, Metavante Corporation (collectively the “Defendants”) in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Jacksonville Division on January 5, 2012. The complaint seeks damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees for the alleged infringement of three patents. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants infringe the patents at issue by providing customers financial and payment solutions that process payment instructions, provide electronic biller notifications, and/or process account-to-account funds transfer transactions and have requested financial damages and injunctive relief. Defendants filed their Answer and Counterclaims to Plaintiffs' complaint for patent infringement denying the claims of patent infringement and asserting defenses, including non-infringement and invalidity. Additionally, Defendants filed counterclaims asserting patent infringement of three patents and adding Fiserv, Inc. as a Counter Defendant. Defendants seek damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. Plaintiffs and Counter Defendant Fiserv, Inc., filed their Answer to Defendants' counterclaims denying the claims of patent infringement and asserting defenses, including non-infringement and invalidity. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion to Amend its First Amended Complaint to add a fourth patent and Defendants' Motion to Amend its First Amended Answer and Counterclaims. Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking an order invalidating all of the Plaintiffs' asserted patents. Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking to invalidate select patent claims from one of Defendants' asserted patents.   On June 24, 2013, Defendants filed for covered business method (“CBM”) post-grant reviews of the validity of the Plaintiff's asserted patents at the US Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO").  On June 25, 2013, Defendants filed a Motion to Stay the case pending the outcome of the CBM post-grant reviews.  The Court denied Plaintiffs'



Motion for Summary Judgment. On December 23, 2013, the US Patent Office instituted Defendants’ CBM Petitions, thereby agreeing to review the validity of Plaintiff's patents. Additionally, on January 17, 2014, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion to Stay the litigation pending the outcome of the CBM review proceedings. On December 22, 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) issued final written decisions on Defendants’ CBM Petition holding that all claims of each of the Plaintiffs' four patents are unpatentable.    On January 6, 2015, the Court issued an Endorsed Order requesting the parties file, on or before March 31, 2015, a joint report advising how the parties intend to proceed in this matter.   Unless appeals are filed and the PTAB’s decisions are reversed, Defendants will have no liability for infringement of the asserted patents.

DataTreasury Corporation v. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. et. al.

This patent infringement lawsuit was filed on May 28, 2013 by DataTreasury Corporation (the “Plaintiff”) against Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (the “Company”) and multiple customer banks in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division.  Plaintiff alleges that the Company infringes the patents at issue by making, using, selling or offering to sell systems and methods for image-based check processing. The Complaint seeks damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees for the alleged infringement of two patents.  On October 25, 2013, the Company filed for CBM post-grant reviews of the validity of the Plaintiff's asserted patents at the USPTO.  The Company filed a Motion to Stay the case pending the outcome of the CBM post-grant reviews. On April 29, 2014, the USPTO instituted the Company's two CBM petitions. On August 14, 2014, the Court granted the Company's Motion to Stay the litigation pending the outcome of the CBM review proceedings. The parties are waiting for the PTAB to issue final written decisions in the CBM post-grant review proceedings.  An estimate of a possible loss or range of possible loss, if any, for this action cannot be made at this time.

Indemnifications and Warranties

The Company generally indemnifies its clients, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, against damages and costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, or trademark infringement associated solely with its clients' use of the Company's software applications or services.  Historically, the Company has not made any material payments under such indemnifications, but continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and would recognize any such losses when they are estimable. In addition, the Company warrants to clients that its software operates substantially in accordance with the software specifications. Historically, no material costs have been incurred related to software warranties and no accruals for warranty costs have been made.

Overview

FIS is a leading global provider of banking and payments technology solutions, and consulting and outsourcing solutions. With a long history deeply rooted in the financial services industry and banking and payment technology solutions, FIS delivers services to more than 14,000 institutions in over 100 countries. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS employs approximately 40,000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing and banking solutions, providing software, services and outsourcing of the technology that drives financial institutions. Through our Capco brand, we deliver globally a wide range of information technology consulting and transformational services to financial institutions. FIS is a member of the Fortune 500 U.S. and of Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 Index.

Business Trends and Conditions

Our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services, consulting and professional services and software license fees.  The majority of our revenue has historically been recurring, provided under multi-year contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream. These services, in general, are considered critical to our clients' operations.  A significant portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of deposit accounts and card transactions associated with consumer and commercial activity.   Consulting and professional services revenues are typically non-recurring, and sales of software licenses are less predictable, a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients.

A continued trend in the financial services industry from which we are benefiting is the migration by many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and rapidly address regulatory challenges.   As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate the effects of year-to-year economic changes on our results of operations.  We believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are targeted and well positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve.

Consulting services revenue grew at an increased pace in 2014

,

and we believe this trend will continue in 2015.  The current market pressures in the financial services industry are driving demand for our consulting and professional services as many financial institutions seek to transform their businesses to significantly reduce their cost base, innovate, and comply with  increased regulatory oversight with regard to information technology and related processes.  Capco provides strategic consulting service capabilities to respond to these market needs and has established itself as a leading global consultancy focused on transformation strategy and execution. Our gross margin percentage will decline if consulting and professional services revenue grows disproportionately to our processing and service revenue, which generally delivers a higher gross margin. In addition, as consulting and professional services revenue grow as a portion of our overall revenue, we likely will have a lower overall percentage of recurring revenue as these services are generally non-recurring.

In 2014, we targeted a  market opportunity in large global financial institutions where we coupled our strategic consulting and transformation services with outsourced technology, services and solutions to help them achieve their business goals.  We made significant, incremental investments in management, sales and account management resources in 2014 to address this opportunity.  We believe this market opportunity remains attractive as these large institutions address the challenges they face, thereby driving demand for our consulting and professional services. Additionally, we believe these large global institutions are likely to increase technology spending to meet competitive pressures after a slowdown during the recent financial crisis years. We expect to sustain our 2014 investment in management, sales and account management resources to pursue this market opportunity.

Consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to faster on-demand banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch, mobile, internet and voice banking channels.  We are focused on enabling our clients to deliver this experience to their customers through our integrated solutions



and services.  We continue to innovate and invest in these integrated solutions and services to assist clients as they address this market demand.

We continue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster, more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels, internet applications and cards.  We believe mobile payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience,  incremental services and benefits.  Mobile payment volume is growing significantly but does not yet represent a meaningful amount of the payments market.  Additionally, new formidable non-traditional payments competitors, such as Apple, PayPal, and large merchants, are investing in and innovating mobile payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity, and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed.  We believe the growth of mobile payments  continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops.  Although we cannot predict which mobile payment technologies or solution will be successful, we cautiously believe our client relationships, payments infrastructure and experience, adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well positioned to maintain or grow our clients' existing payment volumes, which is our focus.

High profile North American merchant payment card information security breaches have pushed the payment card industry towards EMV integrated circuit cards as financial institutions, card networks and merchants seek to improve information security and reduce fraud costs. We have invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate EMV integrated circuit cards so we can guide our clients through this anticipated technology transition, sustain and grow our card driven businesses.  We believe the trend to migrate to EMV cards will accelerate in 2015 and we continue to invest to address market demand.

The use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments, which negatively impacts our check warranty and item-processing businesses, and we expect this trend to continue.  In 2014, we observed a modest deceleration in our check volume decline and to date have been able to successfully mitigate the majority of the impacts of this decline through cost and fraud efficiency actions and new market solutions, which remain our continued focus.

We anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue, primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity, which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business.  However, consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial or detrimental to our business. When consolidations of financial institutions occur, merger partners often operate systems licensed from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose market share if we are providing services to both entities, or we are not the merging parties' provider of core or payment processing, or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. It is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide.  We seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company.

Notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions, our international business continued to experience growth across all major regions on a constant currency basis during the year ended December 31, 2014, including Latin America, Europe and Asia. We expect this growth trend to continue as the result of continued growth in our consulting and professional services, new, large-scale outsourcing clients  and the opportunities we see for similar arrangements.  Demand for our solutions will also be driven in developing countries by government-led financial inclusion policies aimed to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions.  The majority of our European revenue is generated by clients in the United Kingdom, France and Germany.

Information Security

Globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. This is a trend we expect will continue. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities.  The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public information.  FIS is not immune to such attacks.  As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data.  We also operate payment, cash access and prepaid card systems.  FIS, like any large financial technology service provider, is subject to attempted cyber-attacks on a regular basis.  A successful cyber-attack on an FIS system that resulted in sensitive information being compromised, fraud losses or other adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company.



As a Multi-Regional Data Processing Servicer (MDPS), FIS continues to be examined by and have regular interaction with the federal agencies that regulate financial institutions.  These regulators have the authority to take actions they deem necessary  to protect the safety and soundness of the financial institutions they regulate.  Such actions, if taken, could have a material adverse impact on our business.  FIS regularly reports to its regulators and to its clients regarding the Company's continual efforts to enhance its information security and risk management technology, programs and procedures.  In late April 2014, the federal agencies that provide regulatory oversight for FIS issued a confidential report related to their examination of our information security, risk management and internal audit functions between October 2012 and October 2013.  We responded to the report and described the actions that we have taken, as well as ongoing efforts underway to address specific findings.  The regulatory agencies distributed the report, and a cover letter, to a subset of our regulated clients beginning in May 2014.   This prompted inquiries from clients, which, to the extent permitted by federal regulation, FIS has addressed on an individual basis.  While individual clients and prospects have expressed concern over the report, we do not believe that it has had a material effect on the overall sales closures in 2014 or our sales pipeline; however, we continue to monitor sales activity and any potential impact on future periods.  We are unable to predict with certainty what, if any, communications or actions our regulators will have or take with our regulated financial institution clients with respect to our risk management and information security.  We are also unable to predict the effect that any such communications or actions may have on our business.

FIS remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect its clients and its information systems.  This includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services.  We also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients.

Critical Accounting Policies

The accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

The Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing, credit and debit card processing services, other payment processing services, professional services, software licensing and software related services. Revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable. We are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client. These situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition. In making this determination, we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated. Our individual contracts also frequently include multiple elements. We must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual elements can be considered separate units of accounting or should instead be accounted for in combination with other deliverables.  Judgment is also required in ascribing fair value to each deliverable for purposes of allocating consideration.  Due to the large number, broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to, the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position. However, the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, client creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in client payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs.



Provision for Check Guarantee Losses

In our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant client is dishonored by the check writer’s bank, we reimburse our merchant client for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss provisions and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of our client volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our client volumes and the quality of returned checks.  The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates.

Historically, our estimation processes have proved to be materially accurate; however, our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items. Changes in economic conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our clients, and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts. We recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of

$57.2 million

,

$57.3 million

and

$54.7 million

, respectively, for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


.  A ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss provisions net of estimated recoveries as of

December 31, 2014

, would have impacted


net earnings by less than $2.0 million, after-tax.

Computer Software

Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight-line or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life.

The capitalization of software development costs is governed by FASB ASC Subtopic 985-20 if the software is to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, or by FASB ASC Subtopic 350-40 if the software is for internal use. After the technological feasibility of the software has been established (for software to be marketed), or at the beginning of application development (for internal-use software), software development costs, which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development, are capitalized. Research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility (for software to be marketed), or prior to application development (for internal-use software), are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis commencing on the date of general release of the products (for software to be marketed) or the date placed in service (for internal-use software). Software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of (1) the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, which ranges from three to 10 years, or (2) the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues over its useful life.

In determining useful lives, management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate. Useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years.  We also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset (for software to be marketed). There are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software. While we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates, our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment. We generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additionally, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite.

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but shall be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. In 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-08 ("ASU 2011-08"),

Testing Goodwill for Impairment.

The revised standard allows an entity first



to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, referred to in the guidance as "step zero."  If an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent), the "step one" quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit.  ASU 2011-08 provided examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the "step zero" qualitative assessment, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price.

We assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using a September 30th measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement.  For 2014 and 2013, we began our assessment with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in the 2012 step one analysis.  In performing the step zero qualitative analysis for each of  2014 and 2013, examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations, we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts.  Consequently, we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis in 2014 or 2013.

For 2012, primarily for the purpose of validating our valuation assumptions, we elected to proceed directly to the step one quantitative analysis rather than perform the step zero qualitative assessment.  In applying the quantitative analysis, we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach.  The income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required.  Based upon the results of this test, there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units for 2012.

We also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually.  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02 ("ASU 2012-02") modified the former requirement to perform an annual quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets.  Similar to  the ASU 2011-08 guidance for goodwill, it allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired.

For 2014 and 2013, we began our assessment of indefinite lived intangibles with the step zero qualitative analysis  because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2012.  Based upon the results of this test, there were no indications of impairment, except for one trademark with nominal value in 2013.  For 2012, we proceeded directly to a quantitative analysis, using a form of income approach valuation known as the relief-from-royalty method.  Our tests did not result in the impairment of any of our intangible assets for 2012.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions.

Accounting for Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase or decrease as an expense or benefit within income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pre-tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period. We also receive periodic assessments from taxing authorities challenging our positions that must be taken into consideration in determining our tax reserves.  Resolving these assessments, which may or may not result in additional taxes due, may also require an extended period of time.  We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately account for any known tax contingencies. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable. However, final determination of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities



and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period that a determination is made.

Related Party Transactions

We are a party to certain historical related party agreements as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report.

Factors Affecting Comparability

Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions:

•

We have engaged in share repurchase programs throughout all periods presented.  In 2014, we repurchased a total of

8.7 million

shares for $

475.5 million

; in 2013, we repurchased a total of

10.7 million

shares for

$475.9 million

; and in 2012, we repurchased a total of

14.0 million

shares for

$451.4 million

.

As a result of the above transactions, earnings per share in the periods covered by the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be directly comparable.



Consolidated Results of Operations

(in millions, except per share amounts)

* Amounts may not sum due to rounding.

Processing and Services Revenues

Processing and services revenues totaled

$6,413.8 million

,

$6,063.4 million

and

$5,795.8 million

in


,


and


, respectively. The increase in revenue during


of

$350.4 million

, or

5.8%

, as compared to


, is primarily attributable to increased demand for implementation and consulting services, incremental revenues from 2013 and 2014 acquisitions of $83.2 million and growth from our international operations resulting from our expanded presence across Europe and Asia.  The


period included $37.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to


. The increase in revenue during


of

$267.6 million

, or

4.6%

, as compared to


, is primarily attributable to transaction growth and demand for professional and consulting services, higher termination fees, incremental revenues from


and


acquisitions of $55.7 million and increased processing volumes.  The


period included $49.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to


.



Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of revenues totaled

$4,332.7 million

,

$4,092.7 million

and

$3,956.2 million

in


,


and


, respectively, resulting in gross profit of

$2,081.1 million

,

$1,970.7 million

and

$1,839.6 million

in

and


, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (“gross margin”) was

32.4%

,

32.5%

and

31.7%

in


,


and


, respectively.  The increase in gross profit during


as compared to


primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above. The gross margin for


as compared to


primarily reflects the impact of revenue mix, as higher margin processing revenue drove margin expansion that was offset by an increase in lower margin consulting revenue and lower termination fees in


. The increase in gross profit during


as compared to


primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above. The increase in gross margin for


as compared to


primarily reflects the impact of a more favorable revenue mix, as higher margin processing revenue and termination fees drove margin expansion that was partially offset by increases in lower margin consulting revenue and $16.1 million of the Capco acquisition related adjustments described in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled

$810.5 million

,

$907.8 million

and

$763.3 million

for


,


and


, respectively.  The


decrease of

$97.3 million

as compared to


was primarily due to the impact of charges recorded in the 2013 period discussed below, partially offset by 2014 one-time transaction costs, including integration activities related to recent acquisitions and other severance costs.   The


increase of

$144.5 million

as compared to


was primarily due to charges of $131.1 million for the Capco acquisition related adjustments described in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The


period also included higher sales and marketing expense, an increase in health-care benefit expense and  increased investment in security and risk management.

Operating Income

Operating income totaled

$1,270.6 million

,

$1,062.9 million

and

$1,076.3 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

Operating income as a percentage of revenue (“operating margin”) was

19.8%

,

17.5%

and

18.6%

for


,


and


, respectively. The annual changes in operating income and operating margin resulted from the revenue and cost variances addressed above.

Total Other Income (Expense)

Total other income (expense) was

$(217.2) million

,

$(239.4) million

and

$(248.0) million

for


,


and


, respectively.  Interest expense is a large component of total other income (expense), net.  Interest expense totaled

$172.8 million

,

$198.6 million

and

$231.3 million

for


,


and


, respectively. The decrease of

$25.8 million

in interest expense in


as compared to


is primarily due to lower borrowing rates as the result of the debt refinancing activity undertaken during


and


.  Other income (expense) net for 2014 includes a loss of $16.2 on a foreign currency forward contract  associated with the Euro-based purchase price for our Clear2Pay acquisition, the write-off of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs of $7.0 million and the payment of a $29.5 million bond premium associated with the early redemption of certain debt.  The decrease of

$32.7 million

in interest expense in


as compared to


resulted from lower borrowing rates as the result of debt refinancing.  In addition to interest expense, the 2013 period also includes: (a) charges of $(16.1) million for the write-off of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and transaction expenses related to refinancing activities; (b) a net charge of $(45.3) million representing the $51.6 million premium incurred for the early redemption of certain debt offset by the premium reflected in the carrying value of that debt; and (c) a $9.2 million gain resulting from the purchase of the remaining shares of mFoundry, representing the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the minority-interest investment previously held.

Provision for Income Taxes

Income tax expense from continuing operations totaled

$335.1 million

,

$308.9 million

and

$270.1 million

for


,


and


, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of

31.8%

,

37.5%

and

32.6%

for


,


and


, respectively. During 2014, we realized tax benefits related to certain acquired net operating loss carryovers.  This and certain favorable audit resolutions in 2014 contributed to the rate differential for the 2014 period.   In 2013, Capco acquisition related contingent consideration that was recorded in 2013 was not deductible for tax purposes and, therefore, had an unfavorable impact on the 2013 effective tax rate, which otherwise would have been comparable to


.



Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

During


,


and


, certain operations are classified as discontinued, as discussed in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reporting for discontinued operations classifies revenues and expenses as one line item, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The table below outlines the components of discontinued operations for


,


and


, net of tax (in millions):

During the second quarter of 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell our business operation that provides eCas core banking software solutions to small financial institutions in China because it did not align with our strategic plans. This line of business was previously included in the ISG segment.

On January 1, 2010, FIS sold certain assets and liabilities constituting our ClearPar automated syndicated loan trade settlement business. Terms of the sale included an initial cash payment of

$71.5 million

at closing, with the potential for an additional contingent earn-out payment calculated as a function of the business' 2012 operating results.  In May 2013,  we recorded in discontinued operations a gain of

$26.8 million

(

$16.7 million

, net of tax) upon final determination and receipt of the earn-out payment.

Participacoes, our former item processing and remittance services business in Brazil, had no revenue in


,


and


.  Participacoes had expenses of

$10.1 million

,

$23.1 million

and

$47.5 million

for


,


and


, respectively. Participacoes' processing volume was transitioned to other vendors or back to its clients during the second quarter of 2011.  As a result of the dismissal of employees related to the shut-down activities completed in 2011, the


,


and


periods included charges of

$5.1 million

,

$15.7 million

and

$39.1 million

, respectively,  to settle claims or increase our provision for potential labor claims.  The shut-down activities involved the transfer and termination of approximately 2,600 employees.  As of

December 31, 2014

, there are approximately


active labor claims.  Former employees generally had up to two years from the date of termination to file labor claims.  Consequently, we have continued exposure on these active claims, which were not transferred with other assets and liabilities in the disposal.  Any changes in the estimated liability related to these labor claims will be recorded as discontinued operations.

In 2004, Proservvi Empreendimentos e Servicios, Ltda., the predecessor to Fidelity National Servicos de Tratamento de Documentos e Informatica Ltda. (“Servicos”), a subsidiary of Participacoes, acquired certain assets and employees and leased certain facilities from the Transpev Group (“Transpev”) in Brazil.  Transpev’s remaining assets were later acquired by Prosegur, an unrelated third party. When Transpev discontinued its operations after the asset sale to Prosegur, it had unpaid federal taxes and social contributions owing to the Brazilian tax authorities. The Brazilian tax authorities brought a claim against Transpev and beginning in 2012 brought claims against Prosegur and Servicos on the grounds that that Prosegur and Servicos were successors in interest to Transpev.

To date, the Brazilian tax authorities filed four claims against Servicos asserting potential tax liabilities of  approximately $8.0 million. There are potentially 26 additional claims against Prosegur for which Servicos is named as a co-defendant or may be named, but for which Servicos has not yet been served. These additional claims amount to approximately $60.0 million making the total potential exposure for all 30 claims approximately $68.0 million.  While a liability for these 30 total claims is possible, we do not believe it is probable or reasonably estimable and therefore have not accrued for any of these claims.

Net (Earnings) Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest

Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest predominantly relates to the joint venture in Brazil (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and totaled

$(27.8) million

,

$(24.6) million

and

$(19.9) million

for


,


and


, respectively.



Earnings from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax,  Attributable to FIS Common Stockholders

Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to FIS common stockholders totaled

$690.5 million

,

$490.0 million

and

$538.3 million

for


,


and


, respectively, or

$2.39

,

$1.67

and

$1.81

per diluted share, respectively, due to the factors described above coupled with the impact of our share repurchase initiatives.

Segment Results of Operations

Financial Solutions Group

Revenues for FSG totaled

$2,494.0 million

,

$2,344.4 million

and

$2,246.4 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

The overall segment increase of

$149.6 million

, or

6.4%

, for


as compared to


was primarily attributable to growth in (1) consulting and professional services, particularly in risk and compliance and community core banking, (2) mobile and e-banking solutions, and (3) incremental revenues from our 2014 acquisition of Reliance, which is addressed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by lower termination fees. The overall segment increase of

$98.0 million

, or

4.4%

, for


as compared to


was attributable to incremental revenues from 2013 and 2012 acquisitions of $47.0 million, growth in consulting services, mobile and Internet banking solutions, outsourced services and higher termination fees.  The overall growth was partially offset by client losses.

Operating income for FSG totaled

$815.8 million

,

$781.8 million

and

$716.2 million

for


,


and


, respectively. Operating margin was

32.7%

,

33.3%

and

31.9%

for


,


and


, respectively. The increase in operating income during


as compared to


primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above. The decrease in operating margin during


as compared to


resulted primarily because 2013 benefited from higher termination fees.  The increase in operating income during


as compared to


primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above. The increase in operating margin during


as compared to


were driven primarily by higher termination fees, license fees and operating leverage on revenue growth.

Payment Solutions Group

Revenues for PSG totaled

$2,504.8 million

,

$2,454.9 million

and

$2,380.6 million

for


,


and


, respectively.  The revenue increase for


as compared to


was principally due to growth in image and output solutions, strong transaction growth in network solutions and debit processing, partially offset by lower termination fees in 2014. The revenue increase for

Operating income for PSG totaled

$963.8 million

,

$958.4 million

and

$881.2 million

for


,


and


, respectively. Operating margin was

38.5%

,

39.0%

and

37.0%

for


,


and


, respectively. The increase in operating income during


as compared to


primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above. The decrease in operating margin for


as compared to


primarily reflects lower termination fees in 2014.  The increase in operating income during


as compared to


primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above. The increase in operating margin for


as compared to


primarily reflects the impact of a more favorable revenue mix and operating leverage related to the revenue growth noted above.



International Solutions Group

Revenues for ISG totaled

$1,417.3 million

,

$1,266.6 million

and

$1,168.7 million

for


,


and


, respectively.  The


period included $32.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger U.S. Dollar.  Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact, revenues for


increased primarily from growth in implementation and consulting services, continued growth in EMEA and Asia and incremental revenues from our 2014 and 2013 acquisitions of Clear2Pay and Platform Securities, which is further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The


period included $46.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger U.S. Dollar.  Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact, revenues for


increased primarily from higher card transaction volumes in Brazil, growth within our European consulting businesses and continued growth in Asia, Latin America and Europe as a result of the addition of new, large-scale outsourcing arrangements and continued growth in the India ATM management business.

Operating income for ISG totaled

$236.0 million

,

$196.3 million

and

$199.3 million

for


,


and


, respectively. Operating margin was

16.7%

,

15.5%

and

17.1%

for


,


and


, respectively. The increase in operating income during


as compared to


primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above.  The increase in operating margin for


as compared to


primarily results from the 2013 charges discussed below, partially offset by a change in revenue mix.  The 2013 period included $22.0 million of the charge to increase the Capco acquisition related liabilities discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The 2013 period also included $9.1 million for severance and other charges related to cost management initiatives in certain international markets.  Excluding the aforementioned charges,  operating income for 2013 increased primarily from the revenue growth noted above and the operating margin benefited from increased scale and improved operating efficiencies across a number of major geographies.

Corporate and Other

The Corporate and Other segment results consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments. Corporate and Other expenses were

$745.0 million

,

$873.6 million

and

$720.4 million

in


,


and


, respectively.  The overall Corporate and Other decrease of

$128.6 million

for


as compared to


was primarily due to the 2013 charges discussed below and our continued commitment to productivity improvements and cost management. The overall Corporate and Other increase of

$153.2 million

for


as compared to


was primarily due to charges of $129.1 million for the Capco contingent consideration adjustments in


described in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The 2013 period also included higher sales and marketing expense, an increase in health-care benefit expense and increased investment in security and risk management.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Requirements

Our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses, income taxes, mandatory debt service payments, capital expenditures, stockholder dividends, working capital and timing differences in settlement-related assets and liabilities, and may include discretionary debt service, share repurchases and business acquisitions.  Our cash requirements also include payments for Capco's contingent consideration earn-out and for labor claims related to FIS' former item processing and remittance operations in Brazil (see Notes 6 and 3, respectively, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings, including the capacity under our Revolving Loan described in Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had cash and cash equivalents of

$492.8 million

and debt of

$5,067.7 million

, including the current portion. Of the

$492.8 million

cash and cash equivalents, approximately

$310.5 million

is held by our foreign entities and would generally be subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the U.S.  The majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net deposits-in-transit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity.  We expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, capital expenditures and mandatory debt service.



We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, which we have increased over recent years.  On January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors approved an additional 8% increase to $0.26 per share per quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2015.   However, the amount, declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share is payable on March 31, 2015 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 17, 2015.

Cash Flows from Operations

Cash flows from operations were

$1,164.9 million

,

$1,060.3 million

and

$1,046.7 million

in


,


and


respectively. Cash flows from operations increased

$104.6 million

in


and

$13.6 million

in


. The


increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to higher net earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital. The


increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to higher net earnings, the timing of merchant and card transaction settlement activity and other changes in working capital, partially offset by a $51.6 million bond premium payment resulting from the early pay down of our 2017 senior notes in the first half of 2013 and by the $42.0 million payment associated with the Capco acquisition liabilities.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities

Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. We invested approximately

$371.2 million

,

$336.2 million

and

$296.1 million

in capital expenditures during


,


and


, respectively. We expect to invest approximately 5.5-6% of


revenue in capital expenditures.

We used

$595.2 million

,

$150.5 million

and

$63.6 million

of cash during


,


and


, respectively, for acquisitions and other equity investments.  See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant items.  Cash provided by net proceeds from sale of assets in 2012 relates principally to the sale of the Healthcare Benefit Solutions Business discussed in Note 3.

Financing

For information regarding the Company's long-term debt and financing activity, see Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations

FIS’ long-term contractual obligations generally include its long-term debt, interest on long-term debt, lease payments on certain of its property and equipment and payments for data processing and maintenance. For information regarding the Company's long-term debt, see Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes FIS’ significant contractual obligations and commitments as of

December 31, 2014

(in millions):

(1)

These calculations assume that: (a) applicable margins remain constant; (b) all variable rate debt is priced at the one-month LIBOR rate in effect as of

December 31, 2014

; (c) no new hedging transactions are effected; (d) only mandatory debt repayments are made; and (e) no refinancing occurs at debt maturity.



(2)

Amount includes the estimated payment for labor claims related to FIS' former item processing and remittance operations in Brazil (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), amounts due to the Brazilian venture partner and Capco contingent consideration payments (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

FIS believes that its existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet FIS’ expected liquidity needs for the operations of its business and expected capital spending for the next 12 months.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

FIS does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU

2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition, including industry-specific

requirements, and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the International Financial Reporting Standards. The

ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed

to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and

uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other provisions include ensuring the time value of

money is considered in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before

contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning

after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is prohibited. Entities can transition to the standard either with retrospective

application to the earlier years presented in their financial statements or with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of

adoption. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial position and results of

operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity.

Interest Rate Risk

In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations.  We are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps.

The senior notes (as described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) represent substantially all of our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations.  The carrying value of the notes was

$2,950.0 million

as of

December 31, 2014

.  The fair value of the senior notes was approximately

$3,012.5 million

as of

December 31, 2014

.  The potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical


percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt.

Our floating rate long-term debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the FIS Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  An increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would increase our annual debt service under the FIS Credit Agreement, after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps, by

$14.3 million

(based on principal amounts outstanding as of

December 31, 2014

). We performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of

December 31, 2014

, less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt. This sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of

December 31, 2014

, and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt. Further, in this sensitivity analysis, the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year. For comparison purposes, based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of



December 31, 2013

, and calculated in the same manner as set forth above, an increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would have increased our annual interest expense, after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps, by

$7.3 million

.

We use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt.  During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, the notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps decreased by

$1,000.0 million

.  As of

December 31, 2014

, we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed (in millions):

________________________

(1)

0.17%

in effect as of

December 31, 2014

.

(2)

Does not include the applicable margin and facility fees paid to lenders on Term Loans and the Revolving Loan as described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term and Revolving Loans. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are Level 2-type measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.  These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency.  Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts.  Contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.

Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our non-U.S. operations, to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our international operations generated approximately

$1,417.3 million

,

$1,266.6 million

and

$1,168.7 million

in revenues during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, of which approximately

$1,228.5 million

,

$1,086.8 million

and

$1,009.2 million

, respectively was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Brazilian Real, the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Indian Rupee.  A 10% move in average exchange rates for these currencies (assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10% change in all of such rates for the relevant period) would have resulted in the following increase or (decrease) in our reported revenues for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


(in millions):

The impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10% change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant.  Our international operations' revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency, which limits the majority of our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions.



Revenues included

$37.4 million

and

$49.6 million

and operating income included

$8.9 million

, and

$11.9 million

, respectively, of unfavorable foreign currency impact during


and


resulting from a stronger U.S. Dollar during these years compared to the preceding year. In 2015, we expect a moderate increase in unfavorable foreign currency impact on our operating income resulting from the continued strengthening of U.S. Dollar vs. other currencies.

Our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options, to reduce volatility in our results of operations and/or cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes. We do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans.  As of

December 31, 2014

, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately

$85.4 million

and the fair value was nominal. These derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

In conjunction with entering into the definitive agreement to acquire Clear2Pay in September 2014, we initiated a foreign currency forward contract to purchase Euros and sell U.S. Dollars to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates until the closing because the purchase price was stated in Euros.  As this derivative did not qualify for hedge accounting, we recorded a charge of

$16.2 million

in Other income (expense), net during the third quarter of 2014.  This forward contract was settled on October 1, 2014.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.’s and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2014. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.’s and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, all references to “FIS,” “we,” the “Company” or the “registrant” are to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its subsidiaries.

(1)    Basis of Presentation

FIS is a leading global service provider dedicated to banking and payments technologies, outsourcing and related services.   We offer financial institution core processing and ancillary services, card issuer and transaction processing services and strategic consulting services globally.

We report the results of our operations in four reporting segments: 1) Financial Solutions Group (“FSG”), 2) Payment Solutions Group (“PSG”), 3) International Solutions Group (“ISG”) and 4) Corporate and Other (Note 18).

(2)

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The following describes the significant accounting policies of the Company used in preparing the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

(a)

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of FIS, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries that are majority-owned.   All significant intercompany profits, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all cash on hand, money market funds and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of

three months

or less to be cash and cash equivalents. As part of the Company’s payment processing business, the Company provides cash settlement services to financial institutions and state and local governments. These services involve the movement of funds between the various parties associated with automated teller machines ("ATM"), point-of-sale or electronic benefit transactions ("EBT") and this activity results in a balance due to the Company at the end of each business day that it recoups over the next few business days. The in-transit balances due to the Company are included in cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these instruments approximate their fair value. As of

December 31, 2014

, we had cash and cash equivalents of

$492.8 million

of which approximately

$310.5 million

is held by our foreign entities.

(c)

Fair Value Measurements

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of their immediate or short-term maturities. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated to be approximately

$63.8 million

and

$1.5 million

higher than the carrying value as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively. These estimates are based on values of trades of our debt in close proximity to year end, which are considered Level 2-type measurements, as discussed below. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment in the interpretation of current market data. Therefore, the values presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize or settle currently. The Company holds, or has held, certain derivative instruments, specifically interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. Derivative instruments are valued using Level 2-type measurements.

Fair Value Hierarchy

The authoritative accounting literature defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value.



FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

The fair value hierarchy includes three levels that are based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). If the inputs used to measure the fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1.

Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2.

Inputs to the valuation methodology include:

•

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

•

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;

•

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;

•

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3.

Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

Fair Value Measurements

Generally accepted accounting principles require that, subsequent to their initial recognition, certain assets be reviewed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis by comparison to their fair value. As more fully discussed in their respective subheadings below, this includes goodwill, long-lived assets, intangible assets, computer software and investments. There were no significant fair value measurement impairments for


,


or


.

Contingent consideration liabilities recorded in connection with business acquisitions must also be adjusted for changes in fair value until settled.  See Note 6 for discussion of The Capital Markets Company BVBA ("Capco") contingent consideration liability.

(d)

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

. During


,


and


, the Company engaged in hedging activities relating to its variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. The estimated fair values of the cash flow hedges are recorded as an asset or liability of the Company and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets, other non-current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities, as appropriate, and as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is recorded in interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Company’s term and revolving loans (Note 13). The Company’s existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there was no impact on


earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It is our policy to execute such instruments with credit-worthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. As of

December 31, 2014

, we believe that our interest rate swap counterparties will be able to fulfill their obligations under our agreements.

The Company's foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options, to reduce volatility in the Company's results of operations and/or cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. During


and


, the Company entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans.  As of

December 31, 2014

and


, the notional amount of these

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

derivatives was approximately

$85.4 million

and

$57.3 million

, respectively, and the fair value was nominal.  These derivatives have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

(e)

Trade Receivables

A summary of trade receivables, net, as of

December 31, 2014

and


is as follows (in millions):

Approximately

$37.2 million

of unbilled receivables as of

December 31, 2014

relates to services provided under ongoing long-term contracts that was not yet billable pursuant to the terms of those agreements but will be invoiced in 2015.  We expect to generate additional unbilled receivables of

$41.6 million

for these contracts for services performed in 2015.

When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in customer payment terms and collection trends.  Any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs.

A summary roll forward of the allowance for doubtful accounts, for


,


and


is as follows (in millions):

Enhanced collection management has resulted in decreases in the allowance in both


and


.    The decrease in


was also attributable to resolution of a number of specific accounts.

(f)

Settlement Deposits, Receivables and Payables

We manage certain integrated electronic payment services and programs and wealth management processes for our clients that require us to hold and manage client cash balances used to fund their daily settlement activity.  Settlement deposits represent funds we hold that were drawn from our clients to facilitate settlement activities and, as of

December 31, 2014

, included

$139.3 million

of investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days.  These investments are Level 1 and Level 2 type securities in the fair-value hierarchy.  Settlement receivables represents amounts funded by us.   Settlement payables consist of settlement deposits from clients, settlement payables to third parties and outstanding checks related to our settlement activities for which the right of offset does not exist or we do not intend to exercise our right of offset.  Our accounting policy for such outstanding checks is to include them in settlement payables on the balance sheet and operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. The payment solution services that give rise to these settlement balances are separate and



FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

distinct from those settlement activities referred to under

(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents,

where the services we provide primarily facilitate the movement of funds.

(g)

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. FASB ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles — Goodwill and Other,

requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but rather be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. In 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-08 ("ASU 2011-08"),

Testing Goodwill for Impairment.

The revised standard allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, referred to in the guidance as "step zero."  If an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount (that is, a likelihood of more than


percent), the "step one" quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit.  ASU 2011-08 provided examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the "step zero" qualitative assessment, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price.

The Company assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the

fourth

quarter using a September 30th measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement.  For 2014 and 2013, we began our assessment with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in the 2012 step one analysis.  In performing the step zero qualitative analysis for each of 2014 and 2013, examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations, we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts.  Consequently, we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis in 2014 or 2013.

For 2012, primarily for the purpose of validating our valuation assumptions, we elected to proceed directly to the step one quantitative analysis rather than perform the step zero qualitative assessment.  In applying the quantitative analysis, we determined the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach.  The income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required.  Based upon the results of this test, there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units for 2012.

(h)

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, which are Level 3-type measurements. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.

(i)

Intangible Assets

The Company has intangible assets that consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks that are recorded in connection with acquisitions at their fair value based on the results of valuation analyses. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method that takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates up to a


-year period. Intangible assets with finite lives (principally customer relationships and certain trademarks) are reviewed for impairment in accordance with FASB ASC Section 360-10-35,

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, while certain trademarks determined to have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350.  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02 ("ASU 2012-02") modified the former requirement to perform an annual quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets.  Similar to  the ASU 2011-08 guidance for goodwill, it allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired.



FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

For 2014 and 2013, for indefinite lived intangibles we began our assessment with the step zero qualitative analysis  because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2012.  Based upon the results of this test, there were no indications of impairment, except for one trademark with nominal value in 2013.  For 2012, we proceeded directly with a quantitative analysis, using a form of income approach valuation known as the relief-from-royalty method.  Our tests did not result in the impairment of any of our intangible assets for 2012.

(j)

Computer Software

Computer software includes software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight-line or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life, ranging from

five

to


years.

The capitalization of software development costs is governed by FASB ASC Subtopic 985-20 if the software is to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, or by FASB ASC Subtopic 350-40 if the software is for internal use. After the technological feasibility of the software has been established (for software to be marketed), or at the beginning of application development (for internal-use software), software development costs, which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development, are capitalized. Research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility (for software to be marketed), or prior to application development (for internal-use software), are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis commencing on the date of general release of the products (for software to be marketed) or the date placed in service (for internal-use software). Software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of (1) the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, which ranges from

three

to


years, or (2) the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues over its useful life.

(k)

Deferred Contract Costs

Costs of sales, including costs incurred for bid and proposal activities, are generally expensed as incurred. However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of a contract, including sales commissions, are deferred and amortized as expense over the contract life. These costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition or transition activities.

In the event indications exist that a particular deferred contract cost balance may be impaired, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining term and compared to the unamortized deferred contract cost balance. If the projected cash flows are not adequate to recover the unamortized cost balance, the balance would be adjusted to equal the contract’s net realizable value, including any termination fees provided for under the contract, in the period such a determination is made.

(l)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed primarily using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets:


years for buildings and

three

to

seven

years for furniture, fixtures and computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the initial term of the applicable lease or the estimated useful lives of such assets.

(m)

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities and expected benefits of using net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred income taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if any, is reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period enacted.  A valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred income tax asset for which management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the benefits of all or a portion of that deferred income tax asset.



FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

(n)

Revenue Recognition

The Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing, credit and debit card and wealth management processing services, other payment processing services, professional services, software licensing and software related services. The Company recognizes revenue when: (i) evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is considered probable.  Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue.  Revenue generated from contracts executed outside of our North American operations represented  approximately

22%

,

21%

and

20%

of total revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The Company enters into arrangements with customers to provide services, software and software-related services such as post-contract customer support and implementation and training either individually or as part of an integrated offering of multiple services.  The revenues for services provided under these multiple element arrangements are recognized in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition accounting principles as further described below.

In multiple-element arrangements, consideration is allocated to each deliverable using the relative selling price method. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, third-party evidence (“TPE”) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (“ESP”) if neither VSOE or TPE are available.  A delivered item in a multiple element arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting if (a) the item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; and (b) delivery or performance of the undelivered item or items is considered probable and substantially in the Company's control if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item.

We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged when the same element is sold separately, or in the case of post-contract customer support or other recurring services, when a substantive stated renewal rate is provided to the customer. In certain circumstances, the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement. This may be due to infrequent standalone sales for an element, a limited sales history for new solutions or pricing within a broader range than permissible by our policy to establish VSOE. In those circumstances, we proceed to the alternative levels in the hierarchy of determining selling price. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. The Company is typically not able to determine TPE and we rarely use this measure since we are generally unable to reliably verify standalone prices of competitive solutions. ESP is established in those instances where neither VSOE nor TPE are available, considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles.

The Company's arrangements with multiple deliverables may include one or more elements that are subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. The consideration for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverables and the non-software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all of the elements in the arrangement using the above hierarchy. The appropriate revenue recognition guidance is then applied to the respective software and non-software elements.

The following describes the Company’s primary types of revenues and its revenue recognition policies as they pertain to the types of transactions the Company enters into with its customers.

Processing Services Revenues

Processing services include data processing and application and/or facility management.  Revenues from processing services are typically volume-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, transactions processed and computer resources used or can be based on minimum monthly usage fees. Revenues from these arrangements are recognized as services are performed.  As professional services have increased as a percentage of total revenues, processing services have decreased to

75%

of total revenues in 2014 from

76%

in 2013 and

80%

in 2012.

Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings.  We are often responsible for billing the client in these arrangements and transmitting the applicable fees to the third party.  Whether a company should recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. Certain factors or indicators have been identified in the authoritative literature that should be considered in the evaluation.   I

n certain of these arrangements, we have



FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

concluded that recognizing the gross amount billed is appropriate while in others we recognize the net amount retained, depending upon the level of  our contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers.

Professional Services Revenues

Revenues and costs related to implementation, conversion and programming services associated with the Company’s data processing and application management agreements during the implementation phase are deferred and subsequently recognized using the straight-line method over the term of the related services agreement when these upfront services do not have standalone value or if revenue otherwise allocable to these elements is contingent upon delivery of other elements in the arrangement.  Revenues and costs related to other consulting service agreements are recognized as the services are provided, assuming the separation criteria outlined above are satisfied.  Professional services have increased as a percentage of total revenues to

15%

in 2014 from

12%

in 2013 and

9%

in 2012.  A significant portion of our professional services revenues is derived from contracts for dedicated personnel resources who are often working full-time at a client site and under their direction.  These revenues generally re-occur as contracts are renewed.

License and Software Related Revenues

The Company recognizes software license and post-contract customer support fees, as well as associated implementation, training, conversion and programming fees in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 985-605. Initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable, provided that VSOE of fair value has been established for any undelivered elements in the arrangement. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. If evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more undelivered elements of a contract, then all revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered or VSOE of fair value is determined for all remaining undelivered elements. Revenue from post-contract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. The Company records deferred revenue for all billings invoiced prior to revenue recognition.  Software license revenue and related post-contract customer support represented

7%

of total revenues in 2014 and

8%

in 2013 and 2012, with over

70%

of the revenue representing post-contractual support revenue.

When the arrangement with the customer includes significant customization, modification, or production of software, the Company recognizes revenue applying contract accounting. For elements accounted for under contract accounting, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made. Cost-to-cost or efforts-expended (labor hours) methods are used to measure progress toward completion.  Revenues in excess of billings on these agreements are recorded as unbilled receivables and are included in trade receivables. Billings in excess of revenue recognized on these agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met. Changes in estimates for revenues, costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable. If and when the Company’s estimates indicate that the entire contract will be performed at a loss, a provision for the entire loss is recorded in that accounting period.

In arrangements where the licensed software includes hosting the software for the customer, a software element is only considered present if the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. If the arrangement meets these criteria, as well as the other criteria for recognition of the license revenues described above, a software element is present and license revenues are recognized when the software is delivered and hosting revenues are recognized as the service is provided. If a separate software element as described above is not present, the related revenues are combined and recognized ratably over the hosting or maintenance period, whichever is longer.

Hardware and Other Revenues

Hardware and other miscellaneous revenues including termination fees represent approximately

3%

of our total revenues and are recognized following the separation and recognition criteria discussed above.  The Company generally does not stock in inventory the hardware products sold, but arranges for delivery of hardware from third-party suppliers. The Company evaluates the gross vs. net indicators for these transactions and records the revenue related to hardware transactions on a gross

basis as appropriate and the related costs are included in cost of revenue as appropriate if the Company is considered the primary obligor by the customer, bears risk of loss and has latitude in establishing prices on the equipment.

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU

2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition, including industry-specific

requirements, and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the International Financial Reporting Standards. The

ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed

to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and

uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other provisions include ensuring the time value of

money is considered in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before

contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning

after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is prohibited. Entities can transition to the standard either with retrospective

application to the earlier years presented in their financial statements or with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of

adoption. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial position and results of

operations.

(o)

Cost of Revenue and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Cost of revenue includes payroll, employee benefits, occupancy costs and other costs associated with personnel employed in customer service and service delivery roles, including program design and development and professional services. Cost of revenue also includes data processing costs, amortization of software, customer relationship intangible assets and depreciation on operating assets.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, occupancy and other costs associated with personnel employed in sales, marketing, human resources, finance, risk management and other administrative roles. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include depreciation on non-operating corporate assets, advertising costs and other marketing-related programs.

(p)

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation plans using the fair value method. Thus, compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and is recognized over the service period.  Certain of our stock awards also contain performance conditions.   In those circumstances, compensation cost is recognized over the service period when it is probable the outcome of that performance condition will be achieved.  If the Company concludes at any point prior to completion of the requisite service period that it it not probable that the performance condition will be met, any previously recorded expense would be reversed.

(q)

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for the foreign operations of the Company is either the U.S. Dollar or the local foreign currency. For foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency, the translation into U.S. Dollars for consolidation is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using the average exchange rate during the period. The adjustments resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Equity and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Earnings and are excluded from net earnings.

Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income.

(r)

Management Estimates

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Provision for Check Guarantee Losses

In the Company’s check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank, the Company reimburses the merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursues collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss provisions and anticipated recoveries are determined by performing a historical analysis of the Company’s check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of customer volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within customer volumes, and the quality of returned checks. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than the Company’s estimates. The Company had accrued claims payable balances of

$14.5 million

and

$15.2 million

as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively, related to these estimations. The Company had accrued claims recoverable of

$20.4 million

and

$18.6 million

as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively, related to these estimations. In addition, the Company recorded provisions for check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of

$57.2 million

,

$57.3 million

and

$54.7 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2014

(3)    Discontinued Operations

As described below, certain operations are reported as discontinued in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


.  The revenues and earnings (losses) of the businesses included in discontinued operations for the periods presented were as follows:

China eCas Business Line

During the second quarter of 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell our business operation that provides eCas core banking software solutions to small financial institutions in China because it did not align with our strategic plans. This line of business was previously included in the ISG segment.

Healthcare Benefit Solutions Business

On June 25, 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Healthcare Benefit Solutions Business ("Healthcare Business") because its operations did not align with our strategic plans.  The all-cash transaction closed on August 15, 2012 and we received cash proceeds of

$332.2 million

.  We recorded a pre-tax gain of

$22.0 million

and tax expense on the sale of

$78.3 million

, which resulted from the allocation of goodwill with minimal tax basis.  The results of operations of the Healthcare Business were previously included in the PSG segment.

Brazil Item Processing and Remittance Services Operations

During the third quarter of 2010, the Company decided to pursue strategic alternatives for Fidelity National Participacoes Ltda. (“Participacoes”).  Participacoes' processing volume was transitioned to other vendors or back to its clients during the second quarter of 2011.  Participacoes had expenses of

$10.1 million

,

$23.1 million

and

$47.5 million

during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively.  As a result of the dismissal of employees related to the shut-down activities completed in 2011, the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


included charges of

$5.1 million

,

$15.7 million

and

$39.1 million

, respectively, to settle claims or increase our provision for potential labor claims.  The shut-down activities involved the transfer and termination of approximately

2,600

employees.  As of

December 31, 2014

, there are approximately


active labor claims.  Former employees generally had up to

two years

from the date of termination to file labor claims, which extended through April 2013.  Consequently, we have continued exposure on these active claims, which were not transferred with other assets and liabilities in the disposal.  Our accrued liability for active labor claims, net of

$13.8 million

in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

court ordered deposits, is

$17.6 million

as of

December 31, 2014

.  Any changes in the estimated liability related to these labor claims will be recorded as discontinued operations.

In 2004, Proservvi Empreendimentos e Servicios, Ltda., the predecessor to Fidelity National Servicos de Tratamento de Documentos e Informatica Ltda. (“Servicos”), a subsidiary of Participacoes, acquired certain assets and employees and leased certain facilities from the Transpev Group (“Transpev”) in Brazil.  Transpev’s remaining assets were later acquired by Prosegur, an unrelated third party. When Transpev discontinued its operations after the asset sale to Prosegur, it had unpaid federal taxes and social contributions owing to the Brazilian tax authorities. The Brazilian tax authorities brought a claim against Transpev and beginning in 2012 brought claims against Prosegur and Servicos on the grounds that that Prosegur and Servicos were successors in interest to Transpev.

To date, the Brazilian tax authorities filed

four

claims against Servicos asserting potential tax liabilities of  approximately

$8.0 million

. There are potentially


additional claims against Prosegur for which Servicos is named as a co-defendant or may be named, but for which Servicos has not yet been served. These additional claims amount to approximately

$60.0 million

making the total potential exposure for all 30 claims approximately

$68.0 million

.  While a liability for these


total claims is possible, we do not believe it is probable or reasonably estimable and therefore have not reserved for any of these claims.

ClearPar

On January 1, 2010, FIS sold certain assets and liabilities constituting our ClearPar automated syndicated loan trade settlement business. Terms of the sale included an initial cash payment of

$71.5 million

at closing, with the potential for an additional contingent earn-out payment calculated as a function of the business' 2012 operating results.  In May 2013,  we recorded in discontinued operations a gain of

$26.8 million

(

$16.7 million

, net of tax) upon final determination and receipt of the earn-out payment.

(4)    Components of Other Comprehensive Earnings

The following table shows accumulated other comprehensive earnings ("AOCE") attributable to FIS by component, net of tax, for the year ended

There were no related party expenses for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


.  Administrative corporate support and other services with FNF of

$3.4 million

and employee benefits services of

$0.6 million

with Ceridian were included in 2012 expenses.

Brazilian Venture

The Company operates a joint venture ("Brazilian Venture") with Banco Bradesco S.A. ("Banco Bradesco") in which we own a

51%

controlling interest, to provide comprehensive, fully outsourced transaction processing, call center, cardholder support and collection services to multiple card issuing clients in Brazil, including Banco Bradesco.  The original accounting for this transaction resulted in the establishment of a contract intangible asset and a liability for amounts payable to the original partner banks upon final migration of their respective card portfolios and achieving targeted volumes (the “Brazilian Venture Notes”).   The unamortized contract intangible asset balance as of

December 31, 2014

was

$147.0 million

.  Upon the exit of one partner bank, certain terms of the Brazilian Venture were subsequently renegotiated between Banco Bradesco and FIS and were memorialized in an Amended Association Agreement in November


.   Among other things, the payout for the Brazilian Venture Notes was extended over a

ten

-year period.  Additional performance remuneration provisions upon the achievement of targeted account and transaction volumes were renegotiated, for which additional related party payables were recorded as of December 31,


, based on management's expectation that the targets will be met.  The passage of time and the achievement of certain targets triggered payments to Banco Bradesco of

$5.5 million

and

$9.9 million

in


and


, respectively.  The remaining related party payable was

$42.9 million

and

$48.2 million

as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively.  In addition, the board of directors for the Brazilian Venture declared a one-time dividend during the year ended

December 31, 2014

, resulting in a payment of

$34.8 million

to Banco Bradesco and thereby reducing the value of the noncontrolling interest as of

December 31, 2014

to

$121.5 million

.  The remaining Brazilian Venture revenues included

$29.7 million

December 31, 2014

resulting from a stronger U.S. Dollar in


, as compared to


.

The Brazilian Venture currently processes appro

ximately

58 million

cards for clients in Brazil and provides call center, cardholder support and collection services for their card portfolios.

FNF

FIS had shared a number of directors and executives with Fidelity National Financial, Inc. ("FNF"), our former parent, subsequent to becoming an independent company.  As a result, FNF qualified as a related party from an accounting perspective.   As previously reported, William P. Foley II, who serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of FNF, transitioned from Executive Chairman to Chairman of the Board of FIS in February 2011, and then to Vice Chairman in March 2012.   Certain other key executives shared between the two companies ended their employment with FIS during 2012.  As a result, FNF's  level of influence over the management or operating policies of FIS was diminished below the level required to meet the definition of a related party as of September 30, 2012.  All transactions with FNF are, therefore, included in the related party disclosures through that date.

Ceridian

We provide data processing services to Ceridian Corporation (“Ceridian”), and Ceridian provides us with outsourced employee benefits services. FNF holds an approximate

32%

equity interest in Ceridian; therefore, transactions with Ceridian are included as related party activity through September 30, 2012, consistent with the inclusion of FNF as addressed above.

We believe the amounts earned from or charged by us under each of the foregoing arrangements are fair and reasonable. We believe our service arrangements are priced within the range of prices we offer to third parties.

and


that were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, including Clear2Pay NV. ("Clear2Pay"), for

$461.5 million

in October 2014, Reliance Financial Corporation ("Reliance") for

$110.0 million

in July 2014, Credit Management Solutions, Inc. ("CMSI"), for

$29.0 million

in April 2014, mFoundry, Inc. ("mFoundry"), for

$115.0 million

in March 2013, ProNet Solutions, Inc. ("ProNet") for

$22.3 million

in October 2012, Integrated Compliance Solutions LLC ("ICS") for

$20.2 million

in April 2012 and Memento Inc. ("Memento") for

$24.9 million

in April 2012.

The addition of Clear2Pay will expand FIS’ global payments capabilities and enhance our ability to deliver differentiated enterprise payments solutions.  Because the Clear2Pay purchase price was denominated in Euros, we initiated a foreign currency forward contract to purchase Euros and sell U.S. Dollars to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates until the closing.  As this derivative did not qualify for hedge accounting, we recorded a charge of

$16.2 million

in Other income (expense), net during the third quarter of 2014.  This forward contract was settled on October 1, 2014.

Our acquisition of Atlanta-based Reliance enables us to provide a full-service wealth management and retirement offering encompassing technology, full back-office operations outsourcing, and retirement trust and fiduciary services.

The Capco purchase price in 2010 included cash consideration of

$297.8 million

at closing plus future contingent consideration valued at

$113.7 million

based on targeted operating performance in 2013 through 2015.  We recorded an additional charge of

$85.2 million

in December 2013 as a result of amendments to the earn-out provisions based on management's outlook and increased projections of Capco's future results in light of its consistently improving performance.  The amendments established a final agreed amount in total cash contingent consideration and number of shares in equity contingent consideration, subject to reduction and forfeiture provisions if operating performance targets are not met.  The liability had previously been reduced by

$22.3 million

in 2011 and increased by

$43.9 million

in 2013 based on forecasts of achievement of targeted operating performance.  No adjustments were required in 2014 and 2012.  The remaining contingent consideration liability is

$103.3 million

as of

December 31, 2014

.  The remaining payments will be made over the next two years.

In conjunction with the acquisition, Capco and FIS established a New Hires and Promotions Incentive Plan ("NHPP") to attract new employees and to retain and incent existing employees and management.   This plan provided for aggregate payments of up to

$67.8 million

to eligible participants upon achievement of  targeted operating performance in 2013 through 2015. The NHPP was amended and restated in December 2013 to: (1) fix the total amount payable at

$43.4 million

, subject to reduction and forfeiture provisions; (2) establish the named participants and their respective unit allocations; and (3) eliminate any continued service requirements to FIS by the participants after the amendment date.  Based on management's expectation that the operating performance measures will be achieved, the liability for the NHPP was adjusted to the present value of the amended total payout, with the resulting increase of

$18.1 million

recorded in 2013.  Prior to the amendment, the expected liability was being expensed over the performance period, which was deemed to equal the service period.

amount of

$3,000.0 million

maturing on December 18, 2019 (the "Revolving Loan"); and (2) term loans of

$1,300.0 million

maturing on March 30, 2017 (the "Term Loans A-4").   As of

December 31, 2014

, the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan was

$795.0 million

, with

$2,204.2 million

of borrowing capacity remaining thereunder (net of

$0.8 million

in outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Loan).

In June 2014, FIS issued

$1,000.0 million

of new senior notes, including

$300.0 million

of Senior Notes due in 2017 that bear interest at

1.450%

and

$700.0 million

of Senior Notes due in 2024 that bear interest at

3.875%

.  The proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the Term Loans A-4 and to temporarily reduce borrowings under the Revolving Loan until the 2020 Notes were callable.

On July 15, 2014, FIS called the full

$500.0 million

principal amount of 2020 Notes, funded by borrowings under the Company's Revolving Loan and cash on hand.  As a result of the redemption, FIS incurred a pre-tax charge upon extinguishment of approximately

$35.4 million

, consisting of the call premium and the write-off of associated previously capitalized debt issuance costs.

On April 15, 2013, FIS completed the issuance and sale of

$250.0 million

in aggregate principal amount of

2.0%

unsecured senior notes due April 15, 2018 (the "2018 Notes")  and

$1,000.0 million

in aggregate principal amount of

3.5%

unsecured senior notes due April 15, 2023 (the "2023 Notes").  Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions, were

$1,233.1 million

.  The 2018 Notes and 2023 Notes were offered and sold pursuant to the Form S-3 Automatic Shelf Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 5, 2013, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated April 10, 2013.  On April 15, 2013, FIS used a portion of the proceeds from the offering to pay down the outstanding balance of its Revolving Loan. On May 15, 2013, the Company completed a call for redemption of the 2017 Notes for

$801.6 million

, comprised of

$750.0 million

in principal and a call premium of

$51.6 million

.

The obligations of FIS under the FIS Credit Agreement and under all of its outstanding senior notes rank equal in priority and are unsecured.  On December 18, 2014, FIS completed an amendment to the FIS Credit Agreement that, among other provisions, eliminated all existing guarantees from FIS' subsidiaries. The FIS Credit Agreement and the senior notes remain subject to customary covenants, including, among others, limitations on the payment of dividends by FIS, and events of default.

The following table summarizes the mandatory annual principal payments pursuant to the FIS Credit Agreement and the senior notes' indentures as of

December 31, 2014

(in millions).  There are no mandatory principal payments on the Revolving Loan and any balance outstanding on the Revolving Loan will be due and payable at its scheduled maturity date:

Voluntary prepayment of the Term Loans is generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement.  In addition to scheduled principal payments, the Term Loans are (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory prepayment upon the occurrence of certain events.

FIS may redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes on or before May 14, 2020 at a specified premium to par, and thereafter at par as outlined in the indenture agreement.  FIS may also redeem the 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes, 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes at its option in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of

100%

of the principal amount to be redeemed and a make-whole amount calculated as described in the related indenture in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption; provided no make-whole amount will be paid for redemptions of the 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes during the three months prior to their maturity.

We monitor the financial stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis.  The lender commitments under the undrawn portions of the Revolving Loan are comprised of a diversified set of financial institutions, both domestic and international.  The combined commitments of our top


revolving lenders comprise about

67%

of our Revolving Loan.  The failure of any single lender to perform its obligations under the Revolving Loan would not adversely impact our ability to fund operations. If the single largest lender were to default under the terms of the FIS Credit Agreement (impacting the capacity of the Revolving Loan), the maximum loss of available capacity on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Loan, as of

December 31, 2014

, would be approximately

$161.7 million

.

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated to be approximately

$63.8 million

higher than the carrying value as of

December 31, 2014

. This estimate is based on quoted prices of our senior notes and trades of our other debt in close proximity to

December 31, 2014

Therefore, the values presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize or settle currently.

We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and, as such, they are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value included in other comprehensive earnings, net of tax.

A summary of the fair value of the Company’s interest rate derivative instruments is as follows (in millions):

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are Level 2-type measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps. Adjustments are made to these amounts and to accumulated other comprehensive earnings ("AOCE") within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Equity as the factors that impact fair value change, including current and projected interest rates, time to maturity and required cash transfers/settlements with our counterparties. Periodic actual and estimated settlements with counterparties are recorded to interest expense as a yield adjustment to effectively fix the otherwise variable rate interest expense associated with the Term and Revolving Loans for hedge notional amounts.

Our existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there was no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It is our practice to execute such instruments with credit-worthy banks at the time of execution and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. As of

December 31, 2014

as follows (in millions):

Management believes that based on its historical pattern of taxable income, projections of future income, tax planning strategies and other relevant evidence, the Company will produce sufficient income in the future to realize its deferred income tax assets. A valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred income tax asset for which management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the benefits of all or a portion of that deferred income tax asset.  We also receive periodic assessments from taxing authorities challenging our positions that must be taken into consideration in determining our tax accruals.  Resolving these assessments, which may or may not result in additional taxes due, may require an extended period of time.  Adjustments to the valuation allowance will be made if there is a change in management's assessment of the amount of deferred income tax asset that is realizable.

As of

December 31, 2014

The Company participates in the IRS' Compliance Assurance Process (CAP), which is a real-time continuous audit. The IRS has completed its review for years through 2011.   Currently, management believes the ultimate resolution of the IRS examinations will not result in a material adverse effect to the Company's financial position or results of operations. Substantially all material foreign income tax return matters have been concluded through 2007. Substantially all state income tax returns have been concluded through 2011.

The Company provides for United States income taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. For those earnings considered to be permanently reinvested outside the United States, a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable at this time.

Litigation

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various pending and threatened litigation matters related to operations, some of which include claims for punitive or exemplary damages. The Company believes that no actions, other than the matters listed below, depart from customary litigation incidental to its business. As background to the disclosure below, please note the following:



FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

•

These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities.

•

The Company reviews all of its litigation on an on-going basis and follows the authoritative provisions for accounting for contingencies when making accrual and disclosure decisions. A liability must be accrued if (a) it is probable that a liability has been incurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If one of these criteria has not been met, disclosure is required when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may be incurred. When assessing reasonably possible and probable outcomes, the Company bases decisions on the assessment of the ultimate outcome following all appeals. Legal fees associated with defending litigation matters are expensed as incurred.

CheckFree Corporation and CashEdge, Inc. v. Metavante Corporation and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

This is a patent infringement action that was filed by CheckFree Corporation and CashEdge, Inc., subsidiaries of Fiserv, Inc. (collectively, the "Plaintiffs") against Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and our subsidiary, Metavante Corporation (collectively the “Defendants”) in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Jacksonville Division on January 5, 2012. The complaint seeks damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees for the alleged infringement of

three

patents.  Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants infringe the patents at issue by providing customers financial and payment solutions that process payment instructions, provide electronic biller notifications, and/or process account-to-account funds transfer transactions and have requested financial damages and injunctive relief. Defendants filed their Answer and Counterclaims to Plaintiffs' complaint for patent infringement denying the claims of patent infringement and asserting defenses, including non-infringement and invalidity. Additionally, Defendants filed counterclaims asserting patent infringement of three patents and adding Fiserv, Inc. as a Counter Defendant. Defendants seek damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. Plaintiffs and Counter Defendant Fiserv, Inc., filed their Answer to Defendants' counterclaims denying the claims of patent infringement and asserting defenses, including non-infringement and invalidity. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion to Amend its First Amended Complaint to add a fourth patent and Defendants' Motion to Amend its First Amended Answer and Counterclaims. Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking an order invalidating all of the Plaintiffs' asserted patents. Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking to invalidate select patent claims from one of Defendants' asserted patents.   On June 24, 2013, Defendants filed for covered business method (“CBM”) post-grant reviews of the validity of the Plaintiff's asserted patents at the US Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO").  On June 25, 2013, Defendants filed a Motion to Stay the case pending the outcome of the CBM post-grant reviews.  The Court denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment. On December 23, 2013, the US Patent Office instituted Defendants’ CBM Petitions, thereby agreeing to review the validity of Plaintiff's patents. Additionally, on January 17, 2014, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion to Stay the litigation pending the outcome of the CBM review proceedings. On December 22, 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) issued final written decisions on Defendants’ CBM Petition holding that all claims of each of the Plaintiffs' four patents are unpatentable.    On January 6, 2015, the Court issued an Endorsed Order requesting the parties file, on or before March 31, 2015, a joint report advising how the parties intend to proceed in this matter.   Unless appeals are filed and the PTAB’s decisions are reversed, Defendants will have no liability for infringement of the asserted patents.

DataTreasury Corporation v. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. et. al.

This patent infringement lawsuit was filed on May 28, 2013 by DataTreasury Corporation (the “Plaintiff”) against Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (the “Company”) and multiple customer banks in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division.  Plaintiff alleges that the Company infringes the patents at issue by making, using, selling or offering to sell systems and methods for image-based check processing. The Complaint seeks damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees for the alleged infringement of two patents.  On October 25, 2013, the Company filed for CBM post-grant reviews of the validity of the Plaintiff's asserted patents at the USPTO.  The Company filed a Motion to Stay the case pending the outcome of the CBM post-grant reviews. On April 29, 2014, the USPTO instituted the Company's two CBM petitions. On August 14, 2014, the Court granted the Company's Motion to Stay the litigation pending the outcome of the CBM review proceedings. The parties are waiting for the PTAB to issue final written decisions in the CBM post-grant review proceedings.  An estimate of a possible loss or range of possible loss, if any, for this action cannot be made at this time.

Indemnifications and Warranties

The Company generally indemnifies its clients, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, against damages and costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, or trademark infringement associated solely with its clients' use of the Company's software applications or services.  Historically, the Company has not made any material payments under such indemnifications,



FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

but continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and would recognize any such losses when they are estimable. In addition, the Company warrants to clients that its software operates substantially in accordance with the software specifications. Historically, no material costs have been incurred related to software warranties and no accruals for warranty costs have been made.

Leases

The Company leases certain of its property under leases which expire at various dates. Several of these agreements include escalation clauses and provide for purchases and renewal options for periods ranging from

The Company estimates future forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  The Company bases the risk-free interest rate that is used in the stock option valuation model on U.S. Treasury securities issued with maturities similar to the expected term of the options.  The expected stock volatility factor is determined using historical daily price changes of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the expected term of the option and the impact of any expected trends.  The dividend yield assumption is based on the current dividend yield at the grant date or management's forecasted expectations.  The expected life assumption is determined by calculating the average term from the Company's historical stock option activity and considering the impact of expected future trends.

Concentration of Risk

The Company generates a significant amount of revenues from large clients, however, no individual client accounted for

.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.

The Company places its cash equivalents with high credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse clients make up the Company’s client base, thus spreading the trade receivables credit risk. The Company controls credit risk through monitoring procedures.

(19)     Other Equity Programs and Stock Rights

Stock Purchase Rights

WPM, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership affiliated with Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX, L.P. (collectively “Warburg Pincus”) held a stock purchase right for FIS shares that originated from  its initial investment in our subsidiary, Metavante.  During the year ended December 31, 2012,

0.2 million

shares were issued relative to this purchase right.  On March 6, 2013, Warburg Pincus sold

19.3 million

shares of FIS common stock in a secondary public offering, constituting substantially all its remaining ownership position, other than shares it was still entitled to buy under the purchase right agreement.  As of May 23, 2013, in exchange for a cash payment of

$4.9 million

by FIS to Warburg Pincus, the parties terminated the stock purchase right agreement and the Warburg shareholders agreement, thereby eliminating any further rights and obligations with respect thereto.  The cash payment was calculated as the value, on a net settlement exercise basis, of the purchase rights remaining under the agreement on the termination date.  This payment was recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital.
