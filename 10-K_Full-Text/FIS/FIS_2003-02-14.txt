ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Brief History

Certegy Inc. ("Certegy") provides credit and debit card processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the U.S.
and internationally. Last year, we processed over 2.0 billion payment transactions, serviced approximately 38 million card accounts, and authorized over $35 billion of check
transactions worldwide. Our business is comprised of two segments, Card Services and Check Services. Card Services provides card issuer services in the U.S., the U.K., Brazil, Chile, Australia, New
Zealand, Ireland, and the Dominican Republic. Additionally, Card Services provides merchant processing and e-banking services in the U.S. and card issuer software, support and consulting
services in numerous countries. Check Services provides check risk management services and related processing services in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, France, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.

Originally
founded as Telecredit in 1961, our business pioneered the check risk management industry in the U.S. and Canada. Through the development of a centralized electronic database
of consumer check-writing histories, Telecredit delivered real-time check authorization decisions to merchants at the point-of-sale. Through an acquisition in 1977,
the business was expanded to include credit card processing. Subsequently, we have added merchant processing, debit card processing and e-banking services to our Card Services segment, and
check cashing risk management services and check collections to our Check Services segment. In 1990, Equifax Inc. ("Equifax") acquired Telecredit, and continued to operate the card and check
businesses, through separate subsidiaries, as its Payment Services division. While part of Equifax, both Card Services and Check Services expanded outside of North America through a combination of
joint ventures, acquisitions and local start-ups.

Spin-off from Equifax

On March 2, 2001, we were incorporated in the State of Georgia as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax under the name Equifax PS, Inc. On
July 7, 2001, following Equifax's transfer of the assets, liabilities, and stock of its Payment Services division to us, and our adoption of the name Certegy, Equifax "spun off" the Payment
Services division through a tax-free dividend of all of the outstanding shares of Certegy common stock to Equifax's shareholders of record as of June 27, 2001. The Certegy shares
were distributed on the basis of one share of Certegy common stock for every two shares of Equifax common stock held. A total of 68,600,112 shares were distributed. As a result of the
spin-off, we became an independent publicly traded company, with the Certegy shares of common stock registered and trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CEY."

Acquisitions

In May 2001, we acquired the remaining 40.7 percent minority interest in Unnisa Ltda., one of the largest card processing businesses in
Brazil, for $55.5 million in cash. We previously held a 59.3 percent controlling interest in Unnisa, which we acquired in 1998.

In
August 2001, we acquired Accu Chek, Inc., a leading provider of third-party check collection services in the U.S., for $25.0 million in cash.

On
December 31, 2002, we acquired the majority of assets and liabilities of Netzee, Inc. ("Netzee"), a provider of e-banking services to credit unions and
community banks in the U.S., for $10.4 million in cash.


Segment Information

Card Services.

Certegy Card Services provides a full range of card issuer services that enable banks,
credit unions, retailers, and others to issue Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards, private label cards, and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts.
Additionally, we began processing American Express cards in New Zealand in late 2002 and in the Dominican Republic in January 2003. Our debit card services support both off-line
debit cards, which are processed similarly to credit cards, and on-line debit cards, through which cardholders obtain immediate
access to funds in their bank accounts through ATMs or merchant point-of-sale terminals. The majority of our card issuer programs is full service, including essentially
all of the operations and support necessary for an issuer to operate a credit and debit card program. More specifically, we process all the debit and credit card transactions on the credit and debit
cards issued by our customers, including electronically authorizing the transactions, capturing the transaction data, and settling the transactions, and we provide full service back-office
support functions for their programs. These support functions include: embossing and mailing their credit and debit cards to their customers; customer service on behalf of the card issuer to their
customers; card portfolio management and analysis; invoicing their cardholders; receiving and processing cardholder payments; and pursuing delinquent or fraudulent accounts. We do not make credit
decisions for our customers, nor do we fund their card receivables. Our services are menu driven, and offer flexibility for those of our customers that require less than our full service programs.
Such customers include large card issuing institutions that contract with us to provide transaction processing, but who choose to invest the capital and human resources necessary to provide their own
back-office program support.

In
the U.S., we have been highly successful in marketing our card issuer services to credit unions and independent community banks. These two customer segments consist predominantly of
small and mid-sized card issuers that cannot independently achieve the economies of scale that would justify setting up their own credit and debit card operations. We provide our card
issuer services to these customers primarily through our longstanding contractual alliances with the Independent Community Bankers of America, or ICBA, and Card Services for Credit Unions, or CSCU. We
have a standard product offering in place with each of these organizations, which offer these products to their respective members with our company as the services provider. These alliances allow us
to utilize the marketing channels of ICBA and CSCU and eliminate the need for us to negotiate price, terms, and service offerings with individual credit unions or community banks. As a result, we
believe we are the leading provider, in terms of market share, of comprehensive card processing services to credit unions and to independent community bank card issuers in the U.S.

We
provide our card issuer services internationally through our operations in Brazil, Chile, the U.K., and Australia.

Card
Services also provides merchant processing services that enable retailers and other merchants to accept electronic payment cards in payment for goods and services. We provide our
merchant processing services both directly to retailers and other merchants who accept credit and debit cards, and through contracts with financial institutions and others where our solutions enable
them to service the card processing needs of their merchant customers. These services include front-end authorization and data capture services, back-end accounting and
settlement, and dispute resolution services.

In
addition, we provide e-banking services to financial institutions enabling them to offer Internet banking to consumers and businesses. We provide these services either by
licensing our products to our customers for their operation in-house, or as an application services provider, or ASP, where the customers are linked to our central service bureau. Our
retail Internet banking services enable our bank customers to offer a wide array of PC-based banking services to consumers, such as on-line account information access and
electronic bill payment. Our corporate Internet banking services enable our bank customers to offer the business community various electronic commercial banking services,


including transmission of account and other business information between the bank and the business customer, bill payment, funds transfers, loan and account applications, and other electronic
services.

In
2002, revenues from Card Services comprised 66 percent of our total revenues, compared to 67 percent in 2001 and 68 percent in 2000.

Check Services.

Certegy Check Services is a leading provider of check risk management and related
processing products and services to businesses accepting or cashing checks at the point-of-sale. These services utilize our proprietary check authorization systems and risk
assessment decision platforms. We serve national and regional merchants, including national retail chains such as Sears, Best Buy, Circuit City, Walgreens, Federated, Target, and Staples; hotels;
automotive dealers; telecommunications companies; supermarkets; casinos; mail order houses; and other businesses. Our services allow our clients to run their customers' personal and business checks
through a decisioning process that assesses the likelihood that a check will or will not clear.

Our
check risk management services include diverse solutions tailored to the specific needs of the customer. They include Welcome Check® guarantee services, where we accept
the bad check risk associated with checks authorized by our system, and Welcome Check verification services, where our customers retain the risk. We also provide blends of guarantee and verification
services to meet specific customer needs. All of these products utilize our proprietary system, PathWays™. PathWays provides the flexibility, utilizing our risk management data and
proprietary models, to manage check acceptance risk by controlling the risk management parameters on a store by store, or even a cash register by cash register, basis.

In
recent years, we believe we have led our industry in the introduction of new products for existing and new markets. In addition to PathWays, we have introduced: PayCheck
Accept™, which enables supermarkets and gaming establishments to reduce the risk of check losses and fraud in connection with their payroll check cashing services; third-party check
collections for retailers utilizing our verification services; and electronic check risk management solutions enabled for electronic commerce, which enable retailers to safely and securely accept
payments over the Internet. In 2000, in a major initiative with 7-Eleven, Check Services adapted PayCheck Accept to launch a fully automated check cashing service through
7-Eleven's virtual commerce kiosks located at 7-Eleven convenience stores across the country. By the end of 2002, 7-Eleven had 340 kiosks installed in Texas,
Florida, Colorado, Virginia, Utah, and the Washington D.C. area. Additionally, in 2001, the PayCheck Accept platform was modified to facilitate check cashing "in-lane" at grocers and
discounters. The first "in-lane" contract was signed during 2002 with a major discount retailer and rollout began in the third quarter of 2002.

We
provide our check risk management products and services internationally in Canada, the U.K., Ireland, France, Australia, and New Zealand. Our principal product in all those countries
is check guarantee, although mass retailers are beginning to utilize our check verification and collection services.

In
2002, revenues from Check Services comprised 34 percent of our total revenues, compared to 33 percent in 2001 and 32 percent in 2000.

For
additional information relating to our business segments and operations within and outside the U.S., see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
Item 8 of this report.

Our Strategy

We believe that the escalating use of credit, debit, and other electronic payment cards around the globe will continue to present the card processing industry
with significant growth opportunities. Due to escalating check fraud at the point-of-sale, retailers' growing reliance on third-party check risk management services that both
reduce bad check losses

and

maximize sales, through accurate


identification of good check writers, and emerging new markets for check risk management, ongoing strong demand for check risk management services will continue to create growth opportunities.

In
light of the market opportunities, our strategic objective is to strengthen our position as a leading global provider of payment processing and check risk management services. We
intend to concentrate on the following strategies to accomplish our objective.

Card Services.

Utilize our competitive strengths in the U.S. to further increase our share of revenue in the U.S. card, including e-banking,
and merchant processing markets.

Those strengths include:

•

Our
long-term contractual alliances with CSCU and ICBA, through which we maintain proven distribution channels and enjoy strong name recognition,
quality-of-service ratings, and customer satisfaction;

•

Our
"full service" processing capabilities, which enable us to provide among the most comprehensive card processing solutions available; and

•

Our
highly competitive prices.

Grow our customer base and processing volumes substantially outside the U.S.

In international markets, we will continue to
focus our marketing efforts on leading card processing prospects, develop flexible processing services tailored to the diverse credit cultures in Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific,
and utilize our competitive advantages. These advantages include our strength in providing full service processing services, our extensive experience in managing international operations, and our
proprietary card processing systems. Our proprietary systems are highly scalable and portable, and have been customized to process in numerous country-specific environments in over 25 countries around
the world. This customization enables us to enter new geographic markets quickly and less expensively, and positions us to be a preferred vendor for outsourced card processing as this concept starts
to take effect outside the U.S.

Increase our revenues from new and existing products and services.

We intend to aggressively market our expanded debit card
processing products and services and capture a larger share of the rapidly growing debit card markets in the U.S. and abroad. We intend to aggressively market our card marketing services that assist
our customers in growing their cardholder portfolios and e-banking customer bases. We will develop and market Internet service capabilities that will allow cardholders to manage their
credit card accounts and conduct electronic commerce more efficiently and effectively.

Check Services.

Utilize our competitive strengths to increase our market share in our traditional markets, both in the U.S. and
internationally.

Those strengths include what we believe are the industry's most advanced check risk management algorithms and systems, our proven ability to
introduce successful new check risk management products, our position as one of the world's leading transaction risk management services providers, and our company's existing operations and customer
relationships in Europe, South America, and Asia-Pacific.

Continue our development and utilization of increasingly sophisticated risk modeling tools to differentiate our capabilities from the
competition.

These tools include proprietary algorithms and systems that we have developed independently, and others that we have developed with our alliance
partners.

Expand further into new markets such as check cashing, gaming, grocery, government, and Internet commerce by combining our current risk management and identity
authentication services.

This combined


solution provides us with the ability to effectively manage risk in environments where the consumer is not present as well as at the traditional point-of-sale.

Further,
for both Card Services and Check Services, we intend to continue to consider strategic alliances with, investments in, and acquisitions of, domestic and international companies
that would enable us to increase our penetration in our current markets, enter new markets, expand our technology expertise to help us further enhance our processing, risk management, and
e-banking services, or to increase operating efficiencies.

Sales and Marketing

We market our products and services through a direct sales force and indirect sales channels, such as ICBA and CSCU, independent sales organizations, marketing
alliances, and financial institutions. We organize our direct sales force by customer market segment or distribution channel. Additionally, we market directly to our customers and indirectly through
ICBA and CSCU using print advertising and direct mail efforts. We participate in major industry tradeshow and publicity events. Because many of our customers use a single product or service, or a
combination of products or services, our direct sales force targets existing customers to promote cross-selling opportunities. Our strategy is to use the most efficient delivery system available to
successfully acquire customers and build awareness of our products and services.

Seasonality

Our business is somewhat seasonal. The volume of check and card processing is highest during the holiday buying season and during other periods of increased
consumer spending.

Competition

The markets for card transaction processing and check risk management services are highly competitive. Our principal competitors include third-party credit and
debit card processors, including First Data Corporation, Total System Services, Electronic Data Systems Corporation, and Payment Systems for Credit Unions; third-party software providers, which
license their card processing systems to financial institutions and third-party processors; and check authorization, guarantee, and risk management services providers, including First Data's TeleCheck
Services division and eFunds. We also compete against software and transaction processing systems developed and used in-house by our potential customers.

Some
of our competitors are privately held, and the majority of those that are publicly held do not release the information necessary to precisely quantify our relative competitive
position, which varies depending on the segment of our markets. Based on information appearing in a widely-cited industry publication, The Nilson Report, we believe that we are among the largest
third-party payment transaction processors in the world based on annual volumes.

In
general, we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including:

•

The
reliability, security, speed, and capacity of our systems and technical infrastructure;

•

The
comprehensiveness, scalability, ease of use, and service levels of our products and services;

•

Our
strong relationships with CSCU and ICBA, and the related scale advantages achieved through them;

•

Our
ability to interface with vendors of data processing software and services;

•

Our
pricing policies and the pricing policies of our competitors and suppliers;


•

Our
risk assessment and fraud detection expertise;

•

The
timing of introductions of new products and services by us and our competitors; and

•

Our
ability to support unique customer requirements.

Significance of Certain Customer Relationships

Under each of our contractual alliances with ICBA and CSCU, Card Services is the exclusive partner for offering card processing services to those associations'
members. As a result, approximately 40.8 percent of our revenues are derived from their member institutions, although no single institution accounts for a material portion of our revenues. An
early termination of, or significant adverse change in, our relationships with either or both of these associations could harm our ability to retain a substantial portion of our customers and to
attract new customers, and have a material adverse effect on our business. In October 2001, our contract with ICBA was extended through December 2007, and in February 2002, our
contract with CSCU was extended through September 2007.

Research and Development

Our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of our payment processing systems and related software applications
and risk management platforms. We expect to continue our practice of investing significant resources to extend the functionality of our proprietary processing systems, and to develop new and
innovative solutions in response to the needs of our customers. In addition, we intend to offer products and services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels such as the Internet.

Intellectual Property Rights

We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions and trademark, copyright, and trade secret law to establish and protect our trademarks, software, and
know-how. These legal protections and arrangements afford only limited protection of our proprietary rights, and there is no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop
or license products, services, or capabilities that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. We also license certain intellectual property from third-parties. Those include rights under the
Ronald A. Katz Technology Licensing L.P. patents pertaining to various interactive technologies, such as automated forms of customer service, which rights continue through the life of the patents.

Government Regulation

Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal, state, and foreign regulation. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could
result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services, as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.

As
a provider of electronic data processing and back-office services to financial institutions, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal
Financial Institutions Examination Council, an interagency body comprised of the various federal bank and thrift regulators and the National Credit Union Association. In addition, we may be subject to
possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state where we conduct our electronic processing activities.

Because
we maintain a database in the U.S. containing the check-writing histories of consumers, and use that information to provide our check risk management services, our check risk
management business is subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and various similar state laws. Among other things, the Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes requirements on us concerning data
accuracy, and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their check-writing histories, to dispute their accuracy, and to require verification or removal of disputed information.
In furtherance of our


objectives of data accuracy, fair treatment of consumers, and protection of consumers' personal information, in addition to best ensuring we comply with these laws, we maintain a high level of
security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling of
disputes.

Our
check collection services are subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements. The Federal Trade Commission, as
well as state attorneys general and other agencies, has enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.

Because
we conduct business in international markets as well as in the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. that regulate many of the same
activities that are described above, including electronic data processing and back-office services for financial institutions and use of consumer information.

Although
we do not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses, including future consumer protection laws and regulations, will have a material
adverse effect on our company, enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory
compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue.

Employees

As of January 31, 2003, Certegy had approximately 5,861 employees, including 2,902 employees principally employed outside the U.S. None of our U.S. work
force currently is unionized. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with employees to be good.

During
2002, we reorganized certain of our departments around the world and terminated approximately two percent of our workforce. Additional employees will be terminated in 2003 as we
downsize our operations in Brazil, which we anticipate will occur during the first quarter of 2003.

Certain Factors Affecting Forward-Looking Statements

The statements in this report include forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates, and projections about our
business and industry. They are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from what is expressed in those
statements. Many of those risks and uncertainties are beyond Certegy's control. The factors that could, either individually or in the aggregate, affect our performance include matters such as those
described below.

Competition can hurt our business.

Our markets are competitive. Our ability to maintain or improve our competitive positions against current and potential competitors will impact our performance.
While we believe that the quality, breadth, and pricing of our products and services are among the most competitive in our markets, our future results will depend in part on our ability to continue to
compete effectively, which includes devoting sufficient resources vis-à-vis the competition in our various market segments, responding quickly to new or emerging
technologies and changes in customer requirements, and continuing our successful development and marketing of new products and services.

Reduced levels of consumer spending can adversely affect our performance.

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from fees from processing consumer credit card, debit card, and check transactions. Continued sluggishness of the
U.S. economy, including recession or


similar conditions in the international economies where we do business, could negatively impact consumer spending and adversely affect our business.

Reduction in the demand for card processing outsourcing services in international markets could impact our international growth.

We believe demand for card processing outsourcing services in international markets has been increasing. While we expect that demand to continue, a reversal could
negatively impact our card processing revenues and profits.

Reduction in point-of-sale check fraud could adversely impact our Check Services business.

Due to advances in PC printing technologies and other factors, check fraud continues to increase, creating growing demand for our higher value-added check risk
management services. While we expect that trend to continue, a reversal could negatively impact demand for check authorization and guarantee products, and consequently could be detrimental to our
check business.

Weakening of certain market segments could adversely impact the demand for our products and services.

Our Card Services business depends heavily on demand for its products and services from independent community banks and credit unions. Our Check Services business
depends on strong demand from numerous of the major national and regional retailers. Weakening of the financial health of one or more of those segments could impact demand for our products or services
resulting in lower than expected sales and profits.

Loss of strategic relationships or key contracts could reduce revenues and profits.

Although Card Services strategic relationships with the community banks and credit unions remain strong, with long-term contracts with both ICBA and
CSCU through 2007, an unexpected termination of those contractual alliances, which could cause us to lose significant community bank or credit union customers, or any other significant contracts,
could significantly reduce revenues and profits. Our Check Services business has experienced substantial growth over the last few years in the number of major national and regional retailer accounts
under contract. While no one contract is material to the company, unexpected terminations of several of those contracts during a short period of time could significantly reduce revenues and profits.

Our failure to expand our share of the credit and debit card transaction processing market and enter new markets could adversely affect our business.

While we intend to continue our vigorous pursuit of expansion of our Card Services business within the independent community bank and credit union segments of the
U.S. market, the future growth and profitability of our Card Services business will depend significantly on our ability to penetrate other markets, including emerging international markets for
electronic transaction processing and Internet payment systems. As part of our strategy to achieve that penetration, we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities, investments, and alliance
relationships that will facilitate our expansion, and to develop products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands in new markets. If we are unable to do so successfully, the value of
our business could be adversely affected.

Material changes in regulation or industry standards applicable to our businesses or those of our customers could have a detrimental effect on future results.

Various aspects of our businesses and those of our customers are subject to federal, state, and foreign regulation and applicable industry standards. Changes in
or increased regulation of our businesses, or those of our customers, pertaining to credit availability, data usage, debt usage, debt


collection, or other areas could increase our cost of doing business or reduce the value of or the demand for certain of our products and services, which could hinder our performance. Material
changes in industry standards, such as Visa and MasterCard electronic payment standards, similarly could impact our business.

Security breaches or system failures could harm our reputation and adversely affect future profits.

We collect personal consumer data, such as names and addresses, checking account numbers, and payment history records. We process that data, and deliver our
products and services, utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated both by us and by third-party service providers. Although plans and procedures are in place to protect our
sensitive data and to prevent failure of, and to provide back-up for, our systems, we cannot be certain that our measures always will be successful. A security breach or other misuse of
our data, or failures of key operating systems and their back-ups, could harm our reputation and deter customers from using our products and services, increase our operating expenses in
order to correct the breach or failures, or expose us to unanticipated liability.

Risks associated with international operations could impair our business results.

We believe that the international market for our products offers significant growth opportunities and we have committed significant resources to expand our
international activities. As we expand internationally, we will be increasingly subject to several risks associated with international business activities that could increase costs or reduce our
revenues, including political, social, and economic instability, currency exchange rate fluctuations, potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings, and
potential difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables in some foreign legal systems.

A
class action lawsuit entitled Gary and Nancy Ballard, et. al. v. Equifax Check Services, Inc. (now known as Certegy Check Services, Inc.) was filed against us in
August 1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. This lawsuit was based on a claim that, during the period August 1992 through December 31, 1996, we
improperly assessed a service charge on unpaid checks, which allegedly violated provisions of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and California's Unfair Business Practices Act. The action
sought, among other remedies, a refund of all service charges collected from California consumers during this period, prejudgment interest, statutory damages under the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act, and attorneys' fees. These amounts in the aggregate could have exceeded $18 million if the plaintiffs had prevailed in the case. In November 2002, we entered
into a Memorandum of Understanding with the plaintiffs providing for a settlement whereby we will pay $3.975 million, net of amounts covered under a Letter of Agreement with our insurance
carriers, to the plaintiffs in exchange for a full and final release of all claims asserted. The parties are currently proceeding to obtain final approval of the settlement by the Court.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6: Selected Financial Data, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and
Exhibit 99.3: Non-GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, included elsewhere in this report.

Overview

We provide credit and debit card processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the U.S. and internationally through two
segments, Card Services and Check Services. Card Services provides card issuer services in the U.S, the U.K., Brazil, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the Dominican Republic. Additionally,
Card Services provides merchant processing and e-banking services in the U.S. and card issuer software, support and


consulting services in numerous countries. Check Services provides check risk management services and related processing services in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, France, Ireland, Australia, and New
Zealand.

Our
card issuer services enable banks, credit unions, retailers, and others to issue Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards, private label cards, and other electronic payment cards.
Additionally, we began processing American Express cards in New Zealand in late 2002 and in the Dominican Republic in
January 2003. Our merchant processing services enable retailers and other businesses to accept credit, debit, and other electronic payment cards from purchasers of their goods and services,
while our e-banking services enable financial institutions to offer Internet banking to consumers and businesses. Card issuer software, support, and consulting services allow customers to
manage their credit card programs.

Our
check risk management services, which utilize our proprietary check authorization systems and risk assessment decision platforms, enable retailers, hotels, automotive dealers,
telecommunications companies, supermarkets, casinos, mail order houses, and other businesses to minimize losses from dishonored checks, maximize check acceptance, and improve customer service. Our
services include check guarantee, where we accept the risk of bad checks presented to our customers; check verification, where we determine the likelihood that a check will clear and our customer
retains the risk; and certain combinations of check guarantee and verification services. We also provide related service offerings, including risk management consulting and marketing services, which
enable retailers to cross-sell and increase their customer retention, as well as check cashing services and third-party collection services.

Spin-off from Equifax

On July 7, 2001, our spin-off from Equifax Inc. ("Equifax") was completed by consolidating all of the assets and liabilities of the
businesses that comprised Equifax's Payment Services division into Certegy and its subsidiaries and then distributing all of Certegy's outstanding common stock to Equifax shareholders (the
"Distribution"). For periods prior to the Distribution, the consolidated financial statements present our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as derived from Equifax's historical
financial statements. Included in these historical financial statements are certain Equifax corporate expenses that were allocated to us utilizing such factors as revenues, number of employees, and
other relevant factors. We believe these allocations were made on a reasonable basis; however, we believe that, had we been operating on a full year stand-alone basis, we would have incurred
additional expenses of approximately $3.2 million in 2001 and $6.5 million in 2000.

In
conjunction with the Distribution, we incurred $275 million of debt to fund a payment in that amount to Equifax. The historical financial statements do not include any
allocation of Equifax corporate debt or related interest expense, as historically, these amounts were not allocated to the operating divisions by Equifax. We estimate our interest expense would have
increased by $8.4 million in 2001 and $21.7 million in 2000, had Equifax allocated interest expense to us on $275 million of debt in the periods prior to the Distribution. These
amounts of interest are based on annual interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points, which is our cost of borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility.

Components of Income Statement

Card Services generates revenues from charges based on transaction volumes (U.S.), accounts or cards processed (outside the U.S.), and fees for various services
and products (globally), while Check Services
generates revenues from charges based on transaction volumes, face value of checks guaranteed, and fees for various check services and products. Revenues depend upon a number of factors, such as
demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product line, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, and


general economic conditions. Costs of services consist primarily of the costs of transaction processing systems; personnel costs to develop and maintain applications, operate computer networks, and
provide customer support; losses from check guarantee services; interchange (processing fees paid to credit card associations) and other fees related to merchant processing; depreciation and occupancy
costs associated with the facilities where these functions are performed; and reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily
of salaries, wages, and related expenses paid to sales, non-revenue customer support functions, and administrative employees and management, and prior to the Distribution, certain
allocated Equifax corporate costs.

As
part of our card merchant processing business, we contract directly with merchants, as well as with the merchants' financial institutions. When we have a direct relationship with the
merchant, revenues collected for our services are based primarily on a discount rate, which considers the cost of interchange fees. When our relationship is with the merchant's financial institution,
we collect the interchange fees in addition to our transaction fees. In both instances, we are responsible for collecting the interchange fees after settling with the credit card associations.
Interchange fees are recorded as a component of revenues and costs of services.

In
January 2002, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14, "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
"Out-of-Pocket' Expenses Incurred" ("EITF 01-14"), which requires that reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses be classified as
revenues. Historically, such reimbursements have been netted against costs of services in the consolidated statements of income. As a result of this required adoption and certain similar
reclassifications, actual revenues, as previously reported for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 have increased by $84.8 million and $87.3 million, respectively, for
reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses that include postage, delivery, telecommunication, and other costs. Revenues reported for the year ended December 31, 2002 include
$92.7 million of such similar reimbursements. These reclassifications have no impact on operating income or net income.

Highlights of the 2002 Consolidated Financial Results

In addition to the spin-off from Equifax, as discussed above, our financial results for the comparative periods of 2002, 2001, and 2000 were impacted
by our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). Therefore, we have included both our actual
financial results (those prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. or "GAAP") and "non-GAAP" financial results for 2001 and 2000, which include
adjustments for the spin-off and SFAS 142. Exhibit 99.3 to this report provides detailed reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP results for 2001 and 2000. We
believe the non-GAAP results are more useful in analyzing the underlying business by providing a consistent comparison of our historical operating performance.

SFAS 142
modifies accounting for business combinations, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets. As of January 1, 2002, all goodwill amortization ceased. During the
second quarter of 2002, we completed our goodwill impairment testing required by SFAS 142, which resulted in no adjustment to the carrying amount of goodwill. Operating income for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 included $8.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, and $8.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, respectively, of goodwill amortization. For
comparative purposes, the non-GAAP financial results for 2001 and 2000 include adjustments to reflect this accounting change, as if it had been effective on January 1, 2000.

During
2002, we recorded severance and other charges of $12.2 million ($7.7 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share). These charges include: 1) asset
impairment charges of $5.1 million, which consist of a $4.2 million write-off of the remaining intangible asset value assigned to an acquired customer contract in Brazil, due
to the loss of the customer, and a $0.8 million net write-down of our


collateral assignment in life insurance policies held for the benefit of certain employees (the carrying value of our collateral assignment is the lesser of the policies' cash surrender value or our
premiums paid; due to a decline in the market value of the assets underlying these policies during 2002, the carrying value of our collateral assignment was reduced to $6.3 million at
December 31, 2002); 2) a $4.0 million charge for the settlement of a class action lawsuit, net of insurance proceeds (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements);
and 3) severance charges of $3.2 million, due to the reorganization of various departments. Additional severance and related costs will be incurred in 2003 as we downsize our operations
in Brazil, which we anticipate will occur during the first quarter of 2003.

Highlights
of the 2002 financial results, as compared to 2001, are as follows:

•

Revenues
grew 7.7 percent (8.5 percent in local currency) to $1.0 billion.

•

Operating
income of $151.9 million increased 0.4 percent.

•

Interest
expense totaled $7.1 million.

•

Net
income increased by 3.3 percent to $90.0 million.

•

Diluted
earnings per share of $1.30 increased 3.2 percent.

•

Total
debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 was $214.2 million.

•

3.4 million
shares of common stock were repurchased at a cost of $79.6 million.

•

The
acquisition of Netzee's assets was concluded at a cash cost of $10.4 million.

•

Capital
expenditures totaled $49.0 million, excluding $10.4 million for acquisitions.

Consolidated Revenues

Year 2002 compared with Year 2001

Consolidated revenues in 2002 of $1.0 billion increased $72.0 million, or 7.7 percent (8.5 percent in local currency), over 2001. Card
Services revenues grew $29.2 million, or 4.6 percent (6.2 percent in local currency), while Check Services experienced revenue growth of $42.8 million, or
14.1 percent (13.3 percent in local currency).

Overall,
our revenue growth was driven by a 3.3 percent increase in our combined North American and international card issuer businesses, an 8.2 percent growth in card
merchant processing, and a 14.1 percent increase in our global check operations. Currency devaluation reduced total U.S. dollar revenue growth by approximately $7.5 million, or
0.8 percent. The Brazilian real remained volatile throughout the year, which more than offset the strengthening exchange rates of the British pound and Australian dollar.

Year 2001 compared with Year 2000

Consolidated revenues in 2001 of $936.0 million increased $70.1 million, or 8.1 percent (10.8 percent in local currency), over 2000.
Card Services revenues grew $40.7 million, or 6.9 percent (10.4 percent in local currency), while Check Services experienced revenue growth of $29.4 million, or
10.7 percent (11.6 percent in local currency).

Overall,
our revenue growth was driven by a 3.0 percent increase in our combined North American and international card issuer businesses, a 20.7 percent growth in card
merchant processing, and a 12.8 percent increase in our North American check operation. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian real, reduced
U.S. dollar revenue growth by $23.4 million, or 2.7 percent.

Consolidated Operating Expenses

Year 2002 compared with Year 2001

Consolidated operating expenses in 2002 of $856.0 million, which include severance and other charges of $12.2 million, increased
$71.5 million, or 9.1 percent, over 2001. Operating expenses for Card Services
and Check Services increased $19.6 million, or 3.8 percent, and $44.4 million, or 17.0 percent, respectively. Corporate expenses of $19.3 million increased
$7.4 million over 2001.

Excluding
the severance and other charges of $12.2 million in 2002, operating expenses in 2002 of $843.8 million increased $64.5 million, or 8.3 percent,
compared to non-GAAP 2001 operating expenses, which are adjusted for goodwill amortization expense and additional corporate expenses. Excluding the severance and other charges in 2002,
operating expenses for Card Services and Check Services increased $21.2 million, or 4.2 percent, and $40.6 million, or 15.6 percent, respectively, while corporate expenses
of $17.8 million increased $2.7 million compared to non-GAAP 2001 operating expenses.

Costs
of services in 2002 of $730.4 million increased $43.9 million, or 6.4 percent, over 2001. Including adjustments for goodwill amortization expense and
additional corporate expenses in 2001, costs of services in 2002 increased $50.0 million, or 7.4 percent, over non-GAAP 2001. Approximately $13.6 million of this
increase was attributable to growth in card issuer and merchant volumes and other Card Services items, while $36.4 million was driven by higher check volumes, as well as start-up
costs related to our check cashing initiatives and other Check Services items. Card merchant costs of services included $162.6 million and $146.1 million of interchange fees in 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses in 2002 of $113.4 million increased $15.4 million, or 15.7 percent, over 2001. Including an adjustment for additional
corporate expenses in 2001, selling,


general, and administrative expenses in 2002 increased $14.5 million, or 14.7 percent, over non-GAAP 2001. This increase is largely attributable to the growth in our
international card issuer and North American check businesses, as well as incremental costs we incurred as a stand-alone company after the spin-off.

Year 2001 compared with Year 2000

Consolidated operating expenses in 2001 of $784.6 million increased $65.8 million, or 9.2 percent, over 2000. Operating expenses for Card
Services and Check Services increased $31.7 million, or 6.6 percent, and $30.1 million, or 13.0 percent, respectively. Corporate expenses of $11.9 million increased
$4.1 million over 2000.

Including
adjustments for goodwill amortization expense and additional corporate expenses in 2001 and 2000, non-GAAP operating expenses in 2001 of $779.2 million
increased $62.0 million, or 8.6 percent, compared to non-GAAP 2000 operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses for Card Services and Check Services increased
$31.1 million, or 6.6 percent, and $30.1 million, or 13.1 percent, respectively. Corporate expenses of $15.1 million increased $0.8 million compared to
non-GAAP 2000 expenses.

Costs
of services in 2001 of $686.6 million increased $63.5 million, or 10.2 percent, over 2000. Including adjustments for goodwill amortization expense and
additional corporate expenses in 2001 and 2000, non-GAAP costs of services in 2001 increased $60.6 million, or 9.8 percent, over non-GAAP 2000. Approximately
$32.3 million of this increase was attributable to growth in card issuer and merchant volumes, while $31.2 million was driven by higher check volumes. Card merchant costs of services
included $146.1 million and $124.5 million of interchange fees in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses in 2001 of $98.0 million increased $2.3 million, or 2.4 percent, over 2000. Including an adjustment for additional
corporate expenses in 2001 and 2000, non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2001 increased $1.4 million, or 1.4 percent, over non-GAAP 2000.
This increase is largely attributable to incremental costs we incurred as a stand-alone company after the spin-off.

Consolidated Operating Income

Year 2002 compared with Year 2001

Consolidated operating income in 2002 increased $0.5 million, or 0.4 percent, over 2001. Card Services operating income grew $9.6 million, or
8.0 percent (9.4 percent in local currency), while Check Services operating income decreased $1.6 million, or 3.7 percent (5.4 percent in local currency). Combined
operating margins were 15.1 percent in 2002 and 16.2 percent in 2001.

Excluding
the severance and other charges of $12.2 million in 2002, operating income in 2002 increased $7.5 million, or 4.8 percent, compared to non-GAAP
2001 operating income, which is adjusted for goodwill amortization expense and additional corporate expenses. Excluding the severance and other charges in 2002, Card Services operating income grew
$8.1 million, or 6.3 percent (7.6 percent in local currency), while Check Services operating income increased $2.1 million, or 4.8 percent (3.2 percent in
local currency) over non-GAAP 2001 operating income. Excluding the severance and other charges in 2002, combined operating margins were 16.3 percent in 2002 and 16.7 percent
in 2001 (non-GAAP). The decline in our overall margin in 2002 compared to non-GAAP 2001 is attributable to additional general and administrative expenses we incurred as a
stand-alone public company, reduced operating income in our South American card operations due to unfavorable currency rates and volatile economic conditions, and costs associated with our continued
investment in check cashing initiatives.


Year 2001 compared with Year 2000

Consolidated operating income in 2001 increased $4.3 million, or 2.9 percent, over 2000. Card Services operating income grew $9.0 million, or
8.1 percent (9.6 percent in local currency), while Check Services operating income decreased $0.7 million, or 1.6 percent (0.8 percent in local currency). Combined
operating margins were 16.2 percent in 2001 and 17.0 percent in 2000.

Including
adjustments for goodwill amortization expense and additional corporate expenses in 2001 and 2000, non-GAAP operating income in 2001 increased $8.0 million,
or 5.4 percent, compared to non-GAAP 2000 operating income. Card Services non-GAAP operating income grew $9.6 million, or 8.1 percent (9.5 percent
in local currency), while Check Services non-GAAP operating income decreased $0.7 million, or 1.6 percent (0.8 percent in local currency). Combined
non-GAAP operating margins were 16.7 percent in 2001 and 17.2 percent in 2000. The decline in our overall margin is attributable to additional general and administrative
expenses we incurred as a stand-alone public company, higher guarantee loss rates in Check Services, and a 20.7 percent increase in lower-margin card merchant processing revenues. Merchant
revenues have lower margins than the overall business as a result of interchange fees being a component of both revenues and costs of services.

Consolidated Other Income, Net

Other income, net consists of interest income, gains and losses on foreign currency, and gain and losses on the sale or divestiture of businesses. In 2002 and
2001, other income, net consists primarily of net foreign exchange gains related to intercompany balances between our U.S. and international operations. In 2000, other income includes a
$2.2 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in a card processing operation in India.

Consolidated Interest Expense

Interest expense in 2002 of $7.1 million decreased $0.1 million compared to 2001. Including an adjustment in 2001 to reflect additional interest
expense had the spin-off from Equifax occurred as of January 1, 2001, interest expense in 2002 decreased $8.5 million. This reduction in interest expense is driven by lower
interest rates and lower average debt balances in 2002. Our outstanding debt balance at December 31, 2002 was $214.2 million compared to $230.0 million at December 31,
2001. Total borrowings, which were as low as $166.7 million at September 30, 2002, increased in the fourth quarter of 2002 due to stock repurchases and the Netzee acquisition.

Interest
expense for the periods prior to the Distribution principally consists of interest paid on a line of credit held by Unnisa, our card processing business in Brazil, and interest
charged by Equifax on overnight funds borrowed on our behalf. We were not allocated any Equifax corporate debt or related interest expense, as historically, these amounts were not allocated to the
operating divisions by Equifax.
We estimate our interest expense would have increased by $8.4 million and $21.7 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, had Equifax allocated interest expense to us on
$275 million of debt in the periods prior to the Distribution. These amounts of interest are based on annual interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points, which is our cost of borrowing
under our existing revolving credit facility.

Effective Tax Rate

Our effective tax rates were 38.3 percent, 39.0 percent, and 39.1 percent in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. On a non-GAAP
basis, which includes adjustments in 2001 and 2000 as previously described, our effective tax rates were 37.6 percent and 37.7 percent in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The differences
between the GAAP and non-GAAP rates are the result of the change in accounting for goodwill under SFAS 142, effective January 1, 2002.


Prior
to the Distribution, we were included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Equifax. Federal and certain state tax provisions were settled through the intercompany
accounts, and Equifax made income tax payments on our behalf. The provision for income taxes for these historical periods reflects federal, state, and foreign taxes calculated using the separate
return basis.

Consolidated Net Income

Year 2002 compared with Year 2001

Net income in 2002 of $90.0 million increased $2.9 million, or 3.3 percent, compared to 2001. Excluding the severance and other charges of
$12.2 million in 2002, net income in 2002 increased $10.5 million, or 12.0 percent, compared to non-GAAP 2001 net income, which is adjusted for goodwill amortization
expense and additional corporate expenses. Our growth in net income in 2002 compared to non-GAAP 2001 is attributable to increased income from operations, an $8.5 million reduction
in interest expense, and a $1.0 million increase in other income.

In
2001, minority interests in earnings related to minority ownership of Unnisa, our Brazilian card processing operation. We acquired full ownership of Unnisa in May 2001, and, as
a result, there were no minority interests in earnings in 2002.

Year 2001 compared with Year 2000

Net income in 2001 of $87.1 million decreased $1.4 million, or 1.6 percent, compared to 2000. Including adjustments for goodwill amortization
expense and additional corporate expenses in 2001 and 2000, non-GAAP net income in 2001 increased $9.2 million, or 11.8 percent, compared to non-GAAP 2000 net
income. Our growth in non-GAAP net income is attributable to increased income from operations and a $7.4 million reduction in interest expense.

In
2001 and 2000, minority interests in earnings related to minority ownership of Unnisa, our Brazilian card processing operation, and our U.K card processing operation. We acquired full
ownership of our U.K. card processing operation in September 2000, and Unnisa in May 2001.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Prior to the
commencement of public trading on July 9, 2001, weighted average shares outstanding were computed by applying the distribution ratio of 0.5 shares of Certegy common stock to the historical
Equifax weighted average shares outstanding for the same periods presented.

Diluted
EPS reflects the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding
during the period. As there were no historical market share prices for Certegy common stock prior to July 9, 2001, the effect of dilutive stock options for periods prior to the Distribution
were estimated based on the dilutive amounts for the third quarter of 2001. Restricted stock was not issued until after the spin-off.

Non-GAAP
basic and diluted EPS is calculated based on non-GAAP net income. We believe the supplemental presentation of non-GAAP EPS for 2001 and 2000
provides a more meaningful comparative analysis.

Card Services

Over the past five years, our Card Services business has pursued growth in international markets. In September 1998, Card Services expanded its operations
into South America by acquiring a 59.3 percent interest in Unnisa, a card processing business in Brazil, while in May 2001, we acquired the remaining 40.7 percent ownership
interest in Unnisa. In June 1999, we started a card processing operation in the U.K., owning a 51 percent interest, and acquired full ownership in September 2000. In
January 2000, we acquired Procard, a card processing operation in Chile. Also in 2000, we entered into a five-year agreement with a multi-national Australian-based bank to process
cards issued in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., and Ireland, with operations commencing in the second quarter of 2001. This


bank is serviced from our card processing operation in Australia, as well as from our card processing operation in the U.K. Card Services plans to pursue further card processing opportunities in the
Asian and Pacific Rim markets, utilizing our Australian operation as the processing center.

Year 2002 compared with Year 2001

Card Services revenues of $660.9 million in 2002 increased $29.2 million, or 4.6 percent (6.2 percent in local currency), over 2001.
Excluding $6.3 million of revenue related to a one-time license sale in our North American card issuer e-banking operations during 2001, Card Services revenue increased
by 5.7 percent (7.2 percent in local currency). Our revenue growth is attributable to existing and new card growth in both our domestic and international card operations, as well as
increased revenues in our merchant processing business. At December 31, 2002, we were processing 46.7 million cards, which is an increase of 5.0 million cards, or
11.9 percent, over the prior year-end.

North
American Card revenues of $532.3 million in 2002 increased $22.5 million, or 4.4 percent, over the prior year. Excluding the license sale in 2001, Card
Services domestic revenues increased 5.7 percent, driven by an 8.2 percent increase in merchant processing revenues and a 4.2 percent increase in card issuer revenues. Late in the
third quarter of 2002, a large merchant processing customer was acquired and moved its account to its new owner's processor. Additionally, in the second half of 2002, we severed relationships with
other merchant processing customers whose risk profiles no longer met our requirements. Both of these factors reduced our merchant processing revenue growth during 2002 and will also temper growth in
2003. Card issuer revenue growth is the result of increasing card usage, new card growth, and increased pricing on certain contracts that was fully in place by the fourth quarter of 2002. North
American Card transactions increased 8.5 percent over the prior year, with credit card transaction growth of 2.5 percent and debit card transaction growth of 18.7 percent. We
added approximately 1.0 million domestic cards during 2002, increasing our domestic card base to 22.5 million at December 31, 2002.

International
card issuer revenues of $119.1 million in 2002 increased $7.0 million, or 6.3 percent, over the prior year. On a local currency basis, international
card issuer revenues increased by 15.1 percent, driven by card growth in our international regions, with the exception of full service new account
issuance by certain of our customers in Brazil. Excluding South America, international card issuer revenues increased by 44.6 percent (38.0 percent in local currency). International card
growth totaled 4.0 million cards in 2002, increasing our international card base to 24.2 million at December 31, 2002, which represents a 19.8 percent increase over 2001.
The start-up of our Australian card operation and conversion of a multi-national Australian-based bank portfolio in the third quarter of 2001 contributed an additional 1.0 million
cards in 2002, a 38.2 percent increase over its card base at December 31, 2001.

Card
issuer software and support revenue of $9.5 million decreased by $0.3 million over the prior year due to our strategic focus away from software sales.

Card
Services operating income of $129.3 million in 2002 increased $9.6 million, or 8.0 percent (9.4 percent in local currency), while our operating margins
were 19.6 percent in 2002 versus 19.0 percent in 2001.

Excluding
the severance and other charges of $6.1 million in 2002, operating income in 2002 increased $8.1 million, or 6.3 percent (7.6 percent in local
currency), compared to non-GAAP 2001 operating income, which is adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization expense. Excluding the severance and other charges in 2002, combined operating
margins were 20.5 percent in 2002 and 20.2 percent in 2001 (non-GAAP). The increase in operating margin in 2002 compared to non-GAAP 2001 is attributable to the
growth in our North American card issuer revenue, combined with cost improvement initiatives that include renegotiation of certain vendor contracts during 2002 resulting in lower data processing
costs, new technology advances, reductions in the workforce, and other process efficiencies that have been placed in service throughout the year. These initiatives helped to offset the


reduced operating income in our South American operations due to unfavorable currency rates and volatile economic conditions brought on by factors that included the October 2002 Brazilian
presidential election.

Year 2001 compared with Year 2000

Card Services revenues of $631.7 million in 2001 increased $40.7 million, or 6.9 percent (10.4 percent in local currency), over 2000.
Excluding $6.3 million of revenue related to a one-time license sale in our North American card issuer e-banking operations during 2001, Card Services revenue increased
by 5.8 percent (9.4 percent in local currency). Our revenue growth is attributable primarily to a 20.7 percent increase in merchant processing revenues and a 24.6 percent
increase in our international card issuer business, excluding South America. At December 31, 2001, we were processing 41.7 million cards, which is an increase of 6.6 million
cards, or 18.8 percent, over the prior year-end.

North
American Card revenues of $509.9 million in 2001 increased $41.3 million, or 8.8 percent, over the prior year. Excluding the license sale in 2001, Card
Services domestic revenues increased 7.5 percent,
driven primarily by a 20.7 percent increase in merchant processing revenues. Merchant volumes increased from $6.8 billion in 2000 to $8.2 billion in 2001.

International
card issuer revenues of $112.0 million in 2001 increased $3.5 million, or 3.2 percent, over the prior year. On a local currency basis, international
card issuer revenues increased by 22.5 percent, driven by growth in our account base in Brazil and the U.K. and the start-up of our Australian operation. Excluding South America,
international card issuer revenues increased by 24.6 percent (30.2 percent in local currency). International card growth totaled 6.9 million cards in 2001, increasing our
international card base to 20.2 million at December 31, 2001, which represents a 51.9 percent increase over 2000.

Card
issuer software and support revenue of $9.8 million decreased by $4.1 million over the prior year due to our strategic focus away from software sales.

Card
Services operating income of $119.8 million in 2001 increased $9.0 million, or 8.1 percent (9.6 percent in local currency), while our operating margins
were 19.0 percent in 2001 versus 18.7 percent in 2000.

Excluding
goodwill amortization expense in 2001 and 2000, non-GAAP operating income in 2001 increased $9.6 million, or 8.1 percent (9.5 percent in local
currency), compared to non-GAAP 2000 operating income. Combined non-GAAP operating margins were 20.2 percent in 2001 and 19.9 percent in 2000. The increase in
non-GAAP operating margin is attributable to the growth in our North American and international card issuer revenues, offset by a higher level of lower-margin merchant processing revenues,
exchange rate fluctuations, and a reduction in card issuer software and support revenues.

Check Services

We believe check writing has begun to decline as a total percentage of point-of-sale payments due, in part, to the growing use of debit
and credit cards. At the same time, however, demand for our services is strong due to factors that include increasing sophistication of check fraud and higher concentration of bad checks written at
the point-of-sale due to a trend of higher credit quality consumers paying more with credit and debit cards and writing fewer checks. These factors are contributing to a
growing reliance of retailers and other businesses on outside vendors, such as us, to provide check risk management services.

Year 2002 compared with Year 2001

Check Services revenues of $347.1 million in 2002 increased $42.8 million, or 14.1 percent (13.3 percent in local currency), over
2001. Our revenue growth is driven by market share gains in both


our domestic and international check operations. The face amount of checks authorized totaled $35.2 billion in 2002 as compared to $32.1 billion in 2001. Guarantee volumes grew from
$23.3 billion in 2001 to $26.8 billion in 2002, a 15.0 percent increase over the prior year.

North
American Check revenues of $294.6 million increased $36.5 million, or 14.1 percent, over 2001, driven by increased volumes largely resulting from the addition
of new customers.    The face amount of checks authorized in the U.S. totaled $31.7 billion in 2002 as compared to $29.0 billion in 2001.

International
check revenues of $52.5 million in 2002 increased $6.3 million, or 13.6 percent, over 2001, as the face amount of checks authorized increased to
$3.5 billion in 2002 as compared to $3.1 billion in 2001. On a local currency basis, international check revenues increased by approximately 8.6 percent, as the British pound
strengthened against the U.S. dollar.

Check
Services operating income of $41.9 million in 2002 decreased $1.6 million, or 3.7 percent (5.4 percent in local currency), while our operating margins
were 12.1 percent in 2002 and 14.3 percent in 2001.

Excluding
the severance and other charges of $4.6 million in 2002, operating income in 2002 increased $2.1 million, or 4.8 percent (3.2 percent in local
currency), compared to non-GAAP 2001 operating income, which is adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization expense. Excluding the severance and other charges in 2002, combined operating
margins were 13.4 percent in 2002 and 14.6 percent in 2001 (non-GAAP). The decline in operating margin in 2002 compared to non-GAAP 2001 is a result of costs
associated with the continued investment in our check cashing initiatives, as well as the impact of a higher percentage of business shifting toward lower-priced national accounts, partially offset by
the revenue growth in the core check business. Check guarantee net losses have remained relatively stable, even during a difficult economic period for retailers. Improvements in collection
methodologies have enhanced recovery rates, helping us to maintain relatively stable net losses. Operating losses of approximately $1.0 million are anticipated through the first half of 2003
for check cashing, as we roll out the service to additional locations. We expect check cashing to become profitable in the second half of 2003.

Year 2001 compared with Year 2000

Check Services revenues of $304.3 million in 2001 increased $29.4 million, or 10.7 percent (11.6 percent in local currency), over
2000. Our revenue growth is largely attributable to the addition of new customers. The face amount of checks authorized totaled $32.1 billion in 2001 as compared to $28.9 billion in
2000. Guarantee volumes grew from $21.2 billion in 2000 to $23.3 billion in 2001, a 9.9 percent increase over the prior year.

North
American Check revenues of $258.2 million increased $29.3 million, or 12.8 percent, over 2000, driven by increased volumes largely resulting from the addition
of new customers.    The face amount of checks authorized in the U.S. totaled $29.0 billion in 2001 as compared to $25.6 billion in 2000.

International
check revenues of $46.1 million in 2001 increased $0.1 million, or 0.1 percent, over 2000. Currency reduced total U.S. dollar revenue growth by
approximately $2.3 million, or 5.0 percent. On a local currency basis, international check revenues increased by 5.1 percent,

Check
Services operating income of $43.5 million in 2001 decreased $0.7 million, or 1.6 percent (0.8 percent in local currency), while our operating margins
were 14.3 percent in 2001 and 16.1 percent in 2000.

Excluding
goodwill amortization expense in 2001 and 2000, non-GAAP operating income in 2001 decreased $0.7 million, or 1.6 percent (0.8 percent in local
currency), compared to non-GAAP 2000 operating income. Combined non-GAAP operating margins were 14.6 percent in 2001 and 16.4 percent


in 2000. The decline in non-GAAP operating margin is attributable to overall higher check guarantee net loss rates in 2001; however, Check Services profitability and margins progressively
improved each quarter throughout 2001 due to the seasonality of revenues, the addition of new customers, and improvement in guarantee loss rates.

General Corporate

Year 2002 compared to Year 2001

General corporate expense of $19.3 million in 2002 increased $7.4 million over 2001. The corporate office was established during the third quarter
of 2001 and thus, corporate expenses were lower in that initial year.

Excluding
the severance and other charges of $1.5 million in 2002, general corporate expense increased $2.7 million, or 18.2 percent, over non-GAAP 2001,
due to additional corporate costs we have incurred as a stand-alone public company, one-time costs driven by the conversion of administrative functions which were previously outsourced to
a third-party, and recruiting and relocation expenses for new hires.

Year 2001 compared to Year 2000

General corporate expense of $11.9 million in 2001 increased $4.1 million over 2000.

Including
additional corporate expenses in 2001 and 2000 as if the spin-off from Equifax had occurred as of January 1, 2000, non-GAAP 2001 general
corporate expense increased $0.8 million, or 5.6 percent, over non-GAAP 2000 general corporate expense, due to additional corporate costs we have incurred as a stand-alone
public company since the initiation of the corporate office in July 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Year 2002 compared with Year 2001

Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $126.7 million in 2002 as compared with $102.9 million in 2001. The 2001 amount was reduced by
$29.0 million, which is related to the timing of settlements in the card and merchant processing clearing system. Prior to the spin-off, Equifax held the cash deposits associated
with this settlement process, which were included in our intercompany receivable from Equifax, a component of equity. Operating activities provided cash of $131.9 million in 2001 before the
effect of this settlement activity. We used operating cash flow primarily to reinvest in existing businesses and to contribute to the financing of acquisitions, repurchase of common stock, and
repayment of long-term debt.

Net
cash used in investing activities amounted to $59.4 million in 2002 and $128.4 million in 2001. Capital expenditures, exclusive of acquisitions, amounted to
$49.0 million in 2002 and $49.3 million in 2001. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to approximate $40 million to $45 million in 2003. Cash used for acquisitions,
net of cash acquired, totaled $10.4 million and $79.0 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Net
cash used in financing activities amounted to $79.8 million in 2002. Net repayments on long-term debt amounted to $15.8 million, while proceeds from the
exercise of employee stock options totaled $15.9 million. We repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $79.6 million in 2002. Net cash provided by
financing activities in 2001 amounted to $24.9 million. Net borrowings on our revolving credit facility of $230.0 million were used to fund the $275 million payment to Equifax in
July 2001, and the acquisition of Accu Chek in August 2001. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options totaled $4.0 million, and we repurchased 81,400 shares of common
stock at a total cost of $2.4 million in 2001. Net repayments to Equifax were $206.6 million in 2001, which includes the $275 million payment at the time of the Distribution.


Year 2001 compared with Year 2000

Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $102.9 million in 2001 as compared with $103.8 million in 2000. These amounts were reduced by
$29.0 million and $21.4 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, which are related to the timing of settlements in the card and merchant processing clearing system. Prior to the
Distribution, Equifax held the cash deposits associated with this settlement process, which were included in the intercompany receivable from Equifax, a component of the Equifax equity investment.
Operating activities provided cash of $131.9 million in 2001 and $125.1 million in 2000 before the effect of this settlement activity. Operating cash flow has been sufficient to fund
capital expenditures, acquisitions, treasury stock purchases, and long-term debt repayments in 2001 and capital expenditures in 2000.

Net
cash used in investing activities amounted to $128.4 million in 2001 and $78.2 million in 2000. Capital expenditures, exclusive of acquisitions, amounted to
$49.3 million in 2001 and $38.8 million in 2000. Cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled $79.0 million and $46.3 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Cash proceeds from the sale of businesses and other assets amounted to $6.9 million in 2000.

Net
cash provided by (used in) financing activities amounted to $24.9 million in 2001 and $(26.8) million in 2000. In July 2001, we borrowed $275 million on our
revolving credit facilities to fund a cash payment to Equifax in conjunction with the Distribution. Net additions to long-term debt in 2001, including this $275 million and amounts
temporarily borrowed for our acquisition of Accu Chek in August 2001, were $230.0 million. Net borrowings from (repayments to) Equifax, other than the $275 million payment,
amounted to $68.4 million in 2001 and $(26.4) million in 2000. Treasury stock purchases in 2001
amounted to $2.4 million, while other activity, primarily proceeds from the exercise of stock options, provided cash of $3.9 million in 2001.

Note: Guaranteed residual values aggregating $26.2 million related to our synthetic operating leases are not included in the above table.

Other
than facility leasing arrangements, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities. We entered into synthetic operating leases in order to provide us with
favorable financing arrangements with regard to the facilities subject to the leases. The first synthetic lease of $10.1 million was entered into in 1997 and the second synthetic lease of
$23.2 million was entered into in 1999, both of which expire in 2009. Under these synthetic lease arrangements, we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased properties to the lessors. In
the event the properties are sold by the lessors at the end of the lease terms, we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds under $26.2 million, which approximates
79 percent of the value of the properties at the beginning of the lease terms. We believe the fair market values of these properties exceed the amount of the guarantees.


As
described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we have an interest rate swap arrangement in effect that fixes the interest rate for one of our variable
rate synthetic lease obligations. This derivative has been designated as a cash flow hedge, was documented as fully effective, and at December 31, 2002, was valued as a liability totaling
$1.8 million. Additionally, we entered into several interest rate swap arrangements in 2002 that fix the interest rate on $100 million of our variable rate revolver borrowings from
January 2003 to July 2003 at 2.865 percent, an additional $50 million from April 2003 to July 2003 at 2.940 percent, and $100 million from
July 2003 to January 2004 at 3.350 percent. These derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges, were documented as fully effective, and at December 31, 2002, were
valued as a liability totaling $0.8 million.

Other
than our transactions with Equifax, which are described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, we do not have any material related party transactions.

In
July 2001, we obtained a three-year $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility and a 364-day $100 million revolving credit facility,
a portion of which was used to fund a cash payment to Equifax of $275 million in conjunction with the spin-off. Given that our current level of cash and cash equivalents,
$14.2 million as of December 31, 2002, future cash flows from operations, and the amounts available under our three-year revolving credit facility, which totaled
$85.8 million as of December 31, 2002, will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing businesses, we did not renew the 364-day facility upon its expiration in
July 2002. The $300 million unsecured facility bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points. Amortization of deferred financing costs for the $300 million
revolving credit facility averages approximately $0.7 million per year.

We
regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, development activities, and acquisitions. We may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes, either through
further bank financing or the public capital markets, as appropriate. Based on our recent financial results and current financial position, we believe that additional funding will be available if
required to meet our capital requirements.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting
policies involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description:

Reserve for Card Merchant Processing and Check Guarantee Losses.

In our direct card merchant processing business, in the
event that we are not able to collect amounts from our merchant customers that have been properly "charged back" by the cardholders due to insolvency or bankruptcy of the merchant, or for another
reason, we must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the cardholder transaction. We require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to minimize any such risk. In
addition, we utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk and believe that the diversification of our merchant portfolio among industries and geographic regions minimizes our
risk of loss. We recognize a reserve for estimated merchant credit losses based on historical experience and other relevant factors. This reserve amount is subject to risk that actual losses may be
greater than our estimates.

In
our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer's bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the check's face
value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. We recognize a reserve for estimated check returns, net of anticipated recoveries, based on historical experience and other
relevant factors. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates.

Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets.

We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have
occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other long-lived


assets (primarily property and equipment, other intangible assets, and systems development and other deferred costs) may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that such
assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we perform an impairment test in accordance with SFAS 142 for goodwill and SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets" for other long-lived assets. In the opinion of management, goodwill and other long-lived assets are appropriately valued at December 31,
2002 and 2001.

Income Taxes.

We record income taxes in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes"
using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that
exist between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. No provision
is made for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.

Foreign currency translation.

Approximately 17.3 percent of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002
and 35.9 percent of our assets at December 31, 2002 are associated with operations outside of the U.S. The U.S. dollar balance sheets and statements of income for these businesses are
subject to currency fluctuations. We are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the Brazilian real and the British pound against the U.S. dollar. The cumulative translation adjustment, largely related to
our investment in Unnisa, our Brazilian card processing operation, was a $113.4 million and $67.6 million reduction of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Seasonality, Inflation, and Economic Downturns

We are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations such as peak activity during the holiday buying season. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect
on our operating results; however, inflation could adversely affect our financial results were it to result in a substantial weakening in economic conditions that adversely affects the level of
consumer spending. Starting late in the third quarter of 2002, we observed a slowing in consumer spending that mainly impacted the growth within our core check business. This factor contributed to
Check Services revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2002 being lower than was experienced in the first nine months of 2002.

Our
businesses are subject to the impact of general economic conditions; however, historically this has been somewhat mitigated by the continued demand for payment transaction
processing. During the second half of 2002, we noted that ongoing political and economic uncertainty in Brazil has weakened its currency, and has begun to unfavorably impact new card issuance rates by
certain of our customers. We believe that the long-term prospects offered by the Brazilian market are attractive. The Brazilian card market is projected to produce double-digit growth over
the long term. This growth is expected to be driven by a general expansion of credit led by the large market leaders, deeper card issuance into the growing Brazilian consumer base and migration of
payment media from paper-based solutions to card products. Also, the trend towards outsourcing is expected to accelerate as issuers strive to reduce costs. Despite these positive trends, the Brazilian
market is also characterized by political and economic uncertainty that causes volatility in currency values, and historically has resulted in severe inflationary pressures. Significant changes in
bank ownership, as large private banks acquire smaller regional banks and foreign global banks acquire Brazilian banks, can generate both risk of losing customers as well as opportunities for gaining
customers. Our Brazilian strategy is consistent with our global strategy to offer card issuers a broad range of services and card products at competitive prices. The conversion of accounts to our
BASE2000 platform and a continued focus on attaining other cost efficiencies should
provide us with a cost structure that can withstand short-term declines in business driven by the uncertain market and the loss of our largest card issuer customer in Brazil (see
Note 3 to the


consolidated financial statements). Our Brazilian operations had net assets of approximately $204.0 million, which is net of $116.3 million of cumulative translation equity reduction,
at December 31, 2002. These assets are subject to regular evaluations to assess their recoverability. In the opinion of management, these assets are appropriately valued at December 31,
2002; however, future events and circumstances may have an impact on this assessment.

SEC Filings

We provide access to our SEC reports (i.e., Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K) and related amendments free of charge on or through our website as soon as
practible after the report is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Our website address is

www.certegy.com

. We will voluntarily provide
electronic or paper copies of our SEC filings free of charge upon request.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Based on analysis completed and described below, we do not believe that we are exposed to material market risk from changes in interest rates or foreign currency
exchange rates.

Interest rates.

We have an unsecured revolving credit facility that has variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus 100 basis
points; therefore, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations. This risk is somewhat mitigated by our ability to fix the base LIBOR rate for periods of up to six months and by using
interest rate swap arrangements. At January 31, 2003, we have approximately $20 million fixed at a rate of 2.38 percent, $8 million fixed at a rate of 2.74 percent,
$50 million fixed at a rate of 2.68 percent, $12 million fixed at a rate of 2.45 percent, $27 million fixed at a rate of 2.41 percent, and $100 million
fixed at a rate of 2.865 percent for periods ranging from February 10, 2003 to July 8, 2003. We have performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis assuming a 100 basis point
increase in LIBOR for the periods subsequent to these dates and no additional reduction of debt levels. Based on this interest rate increase, interest expense would increase by approximately
$0.7 million per year.

Foreign currency exchange rates.

Approximately 17.3 percent of our revenues for the year ended December 31,
2002 and 35.9 percent of our assets at December 31, 2002 are associated with operations outside of the U.S. The U.S. dollar balance sheets and statements of income for these businesses
are subject to currency fluctuations. We are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the Brazilian real and the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Historically, we have not entered into derivative
financial instruments to mitigate this risk, as it has not been cost-effective. The impact of currency fluctuations on profitability has not been significant since both revenues and costs
of these businesses are denominated in local currency. If the U.S. dollar had a 10 percent higher appreciation against our non-U.S. dollar
denominated businesses in 2002, revenues and operating income would have been reduced by $16.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively. We may use derivative financial instruments in the
future if we deem it useful in mitigating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The cumulative translation adjustment, largely related to our investment in Unnisa, our Brazilian card
processing operation, was a $113.4 million and $67.6 million reduction of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements



REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Certegy Inc. as of December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated statement of
income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of Certegy Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were audited by other auditors who have
ceased operations and whose report dated February 8, 2002 expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements before the reclassification adjustments described in Note 2 and the
transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (Statement) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," described in Note 2.

As
discussed above, the financial statements of Certegy Inc. as of December 31, 2001 and for the two years then ended were audited by other auditors who have ceased
operations. As described in Note 2, the Company reclassified claims recoverable amounts from current liabilities to current assets. As described in Note 2, the Company reclassified
reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses from operating expenses to revenues as required by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14, "Income
Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for "Out-of-Pocket' Expenses Incurred." We audited the adjustments that were applied to reclassify the balances reflected
in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements. Our procedures included (a) agreeing the reclassification amounts to the Company's underlying accounting records, and (b) testing the
mathematical accuracy of the reclassification adjustments. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. As described in Note 2, these financial statements
have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (Statement) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by
the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note 2 included (a) agreeing the previously reported net income to the previously issued
financial statements and the adjustments to reported net income representing amortization expense (including any related tax effects) recognized in those periods related to goodwill that is no longer
being amortized to the Company's underlying records obtained from management, and (b) testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income to reported net income, and
the related earnings-per-share amounts. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in Note 2 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or
apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such adjustments and disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other
form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Certegy Inc. as of December 31,
2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the Company ceased amortization of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1—Spin-Off and Basis of Presentation

In October 2000, the Board of Directors of Equifax Inc. ("Equifax") announced its intent to spin off its Payment Services division, subject to
certain conditions, into a separate publicly traded company with its own management and Board of Directors (the "Distribution"). This Distribution occurred on July 7, 2001 (the "Distribution
Date") and was accomplished by consolidating all of the assets and liabilities of the businesses that comprised the Payment Services division into Certegy Inc. ("Certegy" or the "Company") and
then distributing all of the outstanding shares of Certegy common stock to Equifax shareholders. (The term "Company" is also used to refer to the Equifax Payment Services division prior to the
Distribution.) The Equifax shareholders received one share of Certegy common stock for every two shares of Equifax common stock held as of the Distribution Date. In conjunction with the Distribution,
Certegy made a cash payment to Equifax in the amount of $275 million to reflect Certegy's share of Equifax's pre-distribution debt used to establish the Company's initial
capitalization. This was funded through $400 million of unsecured revolving credit facilities obtained by Certegy in July 2001. Certegy was incorporated on March 2, 2001, under
the name Equifax PS, Inc., as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax. Certegy did not have any operations, assets, or liabilities until the contribution by Equifax to Certegy of the Payment
Services division prior to the Distribution.

The
Company provides credit and debit card processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the U.S. and internationally through two segments,
Card Services and Check Services (see Note 13 for segment information). Card Services provides card issuer services in the U.S., the U.K., Brazil, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and
the Dominican Republic. Additionally, Card Services provides merchant processing and e-banking services in the U.S. and card issuer software, support, and consulting services in numerous
countries. Check Services provides check risk management services and related processing services in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, France, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Prior to the Distribution Date, the financial statements
included the accounts of the Equifax businesses that comprised its Payment Services division. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), and present the
Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Through the Distribution Date, these amounts were derived from Equifax's historical financial statements. As further described in
Note 6, certain Equifax corporate expenses were allocated to the Company through the Distribution Date. These allocations were based on an estimate of the proportion of corporate expenses
allocable to the Company, utilizing such factors as revenues, number of employees, and other relevant factors. In the opinion of management, these allocations were made on a reasonable basis; however,
the costs of these services charged to the Company may not reflect the actual costs the Company would have incurred for similar services had it been operating as a stand-alone company. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any allocation of Equifax corporate debt or related interest expense, as historically, these amounts were not allocated to the operating divisions by
Equifax.

Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well
as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates.


Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenues from its credit and debit card processing and related services based on
a specified amount per account, per card, or per transaction when processed or as services are rendered.

Within
the card merchant processing business, the Company provides a range of processing services, including authorizing card transactions at the point-of-sale,
capturing and transmitting data affecting settlement of payments, and assisting merchants in resolving billing disputes with their customers. Revenues for card merchant processing services are
recognized in the period the transactions are processed or when the services are performed, based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. The Company contracts directly with merchants, as well as
with the merchants' financial institutions. When the Company has a direct relationship with the merchant, revenues collected for services are based primarily on a discount rate, which considers the
cost of interchange fees, which are processing fees paid to credit card associations. When the Company's relationship is with the merchant's financial institution, it collects the interchange fees in
addition to transaction fees. In both instances, the Company is responsible for collecting the interchange fees after settling with the credit card
associations. Interchange fees, which are recorded as a component of revenues and costs of services, were $162.6 million, $146.1 million, and $124.5 million in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Check
guarantee is the process of electronically authorizing a check being presented to the Company's merchant customer, through an extensive database, and guaranteeing the face value of
the check to the merchant customer. Revenues for check guarantee services are based on a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check and are recognized when the obligations to the merchant
customer are fulfilled. Check verification services are similar to check guarantee services, except the Company does not guarantee the verified checks, and the risk of loss is retained by the merchant
customer. Revenues for check verification services are based on a fixed amount per check and are recognized when the checks are verified.

The
Company licenses card issuer software products that allow customers to manage their credit card programs. These products include a complete suite of UNIX and mainframe credit card
issuing and acquiring software. Software license revenues are recognized in accordance with Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." In certain software arrangements,
the Company provides consulting services, which include implementation and upgrades to the existing base software. For license sales that do not include consulting services, and where the license fee
is fixed and determinable, collectibility is probable, and evidence of an arrangement exists, revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred. For professional services related to card issuer
software and for licenses that include consulting or processing services, revenue is recognized over the period the services are performed. Card issuer software maintenance and support revenues are
recognized over the term of the contract or as services are performed.

In
January 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14, "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
"Out-of-Pocket' Expenses Incurred" ("EITF 01-14"), which requires that reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses be classified as
revenues. Historically, such reimbursements have been netted against costs of services in the consolidated statements of income. As a result of this required adoption and certain similar
reclassifications, actual revenues, as previously reported for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 have increased by $84.8 million and $87.3 million, respectively, for
reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses that include postage, delivery, telecommunication, and other costs. Revenues reported for the year ended December 31, 2002 include
$92.7 million for such similar reimbursements.

Reserve for Card Merchant Processing and Check Guarantee Losses.

In the Company's direct card merchant processing business,
in the event that the Company is not able to collect amounts from its merchant customers that have been properly "charged back" by the cardholders due to insolvency or bankruptcy of the merchant, or
for another reason, the Company must bear the credit risk for the full


amount of the cardholder transaction. The Company requires cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to minimize any such risk. In addition, the Company utilizes a number of
systems and procedures to manage merchant risk and believes that the diversification of its merchant portfolio among industries and geographic regions minimizes its risk of loss. The Company
recognizes a reserve for estimated merchant credit losses based on historical experience and other
relevant factors. This reserve amount is subject to risk that actual losses may be greater than the Company's estimates. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had aggregate card merchant
processing loss reserves of $1.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively, which are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the reserves
from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to the write-off of a merchant settlement that had been previously reserved.

In
the Company's check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer's bank, the Company reimburses its merchant customer
for the check's face value and pursues collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. The Company's merchant customers have approximately 60 days from the check date to present
claims for dishonored checks to the Company. The Company has a maximum potential liability equal to the value of all checks presented to its merchant customers; however, through historical experience
and thorough analysis, the Company is able to estimate, with reasonable certainty, its liability for check returns. The Company recognizes a reserve for estimated check returns (claims payable), net
of anticipated recoveries (claims recoverable), based on historical experience and other relevant factors. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts
returned and recovered may be different than the Company's estimates.

Historically,
the Company has netted the claims payable and claims recoverable amounts within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. However, in 2002, the Company
reclassified the claims recoverable as a current asset and the claims payable as a current liability. The 2001 amounts have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. Balances as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows:



(In thousands)

$

38,658

The
Company settles its claim obligations with merchants on average within 14 days. Recoverability of claims from the check writers extends beyond this timeframe, but generally
occurs within a one-year timeframe.

Expenses
of $146.1 million, $128.7 million, and $106.8 million, respectively, were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, for card
merchant processing losses and check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries. Amounts written-off, or in the case of check guarantee losses, the amounts paid to the Company's
merchant customers, net of amounts recovered from check writers, were $153.0 million, $130.7 million, and $107.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001, and 2000.

Stock Based Compensation.

As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), the Company continues to account for stock based employee compensation plans under APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" ("APB 25").

Earnings Per Share.

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Prior to the commencement of public trading on July 9, 2001, weighted average shares outstanding were computed


by applying the distribution ratio of 0.5 shares of Certegy common stock to the historical Equifax weighted average shares outstanding for the same periods presented.

Diluted
EPS reflects the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted EPS in 2002 excludes 1,358 weighted average stock options since these options were antidilutive. As there were no historical market share prices for Certegy's common stock
prior to July 9, 2001, the effect of dilutive stock options for periods prior to the Distribution Date were estimated based on the dilutive amounts for the third quarter of 2001. Restricted
stock was not issued until after the Distribution Date.

A
reconciliation of the average outstanding shares used in the basic and diluted EPS calculations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 is as follows:

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all liquid investments with an initial maturity
of three months or less when purchased.

Settlement Deposits, Receivables, and Payables.

Settlement receivables and payables result from timing differences in the
Company's settlement process with merchants, financial institutions, and credit card associations related to merchant and card transaction processing and third-party check collections. Cash held by
the Company associated with this settlement process is classified as settlement deposits in the consolidated balance sheets. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2001 and 2000 was reduced by
$29.0 million and $21.4 million related to the timing of such settlements, as prior to the Distribution, settlement deposits were held by Equifax and included in the intercompany
receivable from Equifax, a component of the Equifax equity investment.

The
Company has an unsecured revolving credit facility that provides advances up to $130 million to finance its customers' shortfalls in the daily funding requirements associated
with the Company's credit and debit card settlement operations. Amounts borrowed are typically repaid within one to two business days, as customers fund the shortfalls. This facility has a variable
interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points and contains certain financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. This facility has a term of 364 days
and was renewed upon its expiration date in June 2002. Amounts may be repaid at any time within this term. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002.
Approximately $10.5 million was outstanding at December 31,
2001, which is included in settlement payables in the consolidated balance sheet. This amount was repaid on January 2, 2002.

Trade Accounts Receivable.

The Company's provisions for losses on trade accounts receivable were $1.7 million,
$1.3 million, and $1.3 million, respectively, and write-offs, net of recoveries, were $1.6 million, $0.9 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000.

Property and Equipment.

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated
useful lives as follows: leasehold improvements—not to exceed lease terms; data


processing equipment—3 to 5 years; and furniture and fixtures—3 to 8 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

Property
and equipment at December 31, 2002 and 2001 consist of the following:

Depreciation
and amortization expense for property and equipment was $15.3 million in 2002, $13.8 million in 2001, and $13.9 million in 2000.

Goodwill.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," ("SFAS 142") effective
January 1, 2002 for acquisitions that occurred prior to June 30, 2001. Accordingly, the amortization of goodwill ceased on January 1, 2002. During the second quarter of 2002, the
Company completed its first fair value-based impairment test, which resulted in no impairment losses being recorded. The Company will continue to evaluate goodwill for impairment, at least annually,
in accordance with SFAS 142. Goodwill by segment, net of accumulated amortization at December 31, 2002 and 2001 recorded prior to the adoption of SFAS 142, is as follows:

Check Services

The
change in the carrying amount of goodwill from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 was primarily the result of currency translation adjustments.

Adoption
of the non-amortization provisions of SFAS 142 as of January 1, 2000 would have increased net income for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively, by $7.3 million and $6.8 million, which is net of $1.3 million and $1.2 million in income taxes, or $0.10 per diluted share in each period.

Other Intangible Assets.

The Company's acquired intangible assets subject to amortization at December 31, 2002 and

The
Company's other intangible assets consist of data files, customer lists, technology, and other acquired customer contracts, which are amortized on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5 to 15 years. Amortization expense associated with the Company's acquired intangible assets totaled $3.0 million.
$2.4 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2002, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $4.2 million
associated with an acquired contract due to the loss of the customer in Card Services Brazilian operation (Note 3). Estimated amortization expense for the Company's acquired intangible assets
for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows: 2003–$4.2 million; 2004–$4.2 million; 2005–$4.1 million;
2006–$4.1 million; and 2007–$4.1 million.

The
Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Systems Development and Other Deferred Costs and Other Assets.

The costs of internally developed systems costs used to
provide services to customers or for internal administrative services and other deferred costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over five to eight years, as
determined by their estimated useful lives. Other assets principally consist of prepaid pension cost, purchased software, and deferred income taxes (see Note 8). The costs of purchased software
used to provide services to customers or for internal administrative services are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over five to eight years, as determined by their
estimated useful lives. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

Other
assets, net at December 31, 2002 and 2001 consist of the following:

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, accumulated amortization was $84.6 million and $71.6 million, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

Long-lived assets include property and equipment, other intangible
assets, systems development and other deferred costs, and other assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"
("SFAS 144"), the Company regularly evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying
amount of long-lived assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the
Company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related business over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the carrying amount of the related asset is
recoverable. To the extent these projections indicate that future undiscounted net cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the related assets, the underlying assets are
written down by charges to expense so that the carrying amount is equal to fair value, primarily determined based on future discounted cash flows. In the opinion of management, the
long-lived assets are appropriately valued at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries represent the minority shareholders' share of
the after-tax net income or loss of various consolidated subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2002, there were no minority interests in any of the Company's subsidiaries.


Foreign Currency Translation.

The Company has foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency. Gains
and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are included in determining net income for the period in which exchange rates change. The assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including long-term intercompany balances, are translated at the year-end rate of exchange, and income statement items are translated at
the average rates prevailing during the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of shareholders' equity. The effects of foreign currency gains and losses arising from
these translations of assets and liabilities are included as a component of other comprehensive income.

Supplemental Cash Flow Information.

Supplemental cash flow disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001,
and 2000 are as follows:

$

Prior
to the Distribution, cash paid for income taxes represented only payments for foreign and certain state income taxes. Payments for federal and unitary state income taxes were
reflected as a component of net transactions with Equifax in the consolidated financial statements.

Financial Instruments.

The Company considers the carrying amounts of its financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities to approximate their fair market values due to their short maturity. The carrying amount of the Company's long-term debt
approximates its fair market value given the debt arrangements have variable interest rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt.

Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 requires
that a company recognize derivatives as assets or liabilities on its balance sheet, and also requires that the gain or loss related to the effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The Company has an interest rate swap arrangement that, in effect, fixes the interest rate for a related variable rate lease obligation
(Note 11). This derivative has been designated as a cash flow hedge, was documented as fully effective, and at December 31, 2002, was valued as a liability totaling $1.8 million.
The notional amount of the debt underlying the swap arrangement at the date of the transaction was $10.1 million.

Additionally,
the Company entered into several interest rate swap arrangements in 2002 that fix the interest rate on $100 million of variable rate revolver borrowings from
January 2003 to July 2003 at 2.865 percent, an additional $50 million from April 2003 to July 2003 at 2.940 percent, and $100 million from
July 2003 to January 2004 at 3.350 percent. These derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges, were documented as fully effective, and at December 31, 2002, were
valued as a liability totaling $0.8 million.

The
values of these swap arrangements are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and the related losses are recorded, net of income tax, as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

In June 2002, the FASB approved SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," ("SFAS 146"). SFAS 146 addresses accounting for costs to terminate contracts that are not capital leases, costs to consolidate facilities or
relocate employees, and termination benefits. SFAS 146 requires that the fair value of a liability for penalties for early contract termination be recognized when the entity effectively
terminates the contract. The fair value of a liability for other contract termination costs should be recognized when an


entity ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract. The liability for one-time termination benefits should be accrued ratably over the future service period based on when the
employees are entitled to receive the benefits and a minimum retention period. SFAS 146 is effective for disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement, but does not expect a material impact from the adoption of SFAS 146 on the consolidated financial statements.

In
November 2002, the FASB approved FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others," ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees and clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must
recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. FIN 45 is
effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. However, the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for the Company's financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2002 and are included in Note 2 under the heading "Reserve for Card Merchant Processing and Check Guarantee Losses" for the Company's check guarantee
business and Note 11 for the Company's guarantees of the residual values of leased properties. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the application of this interpretation, but does
not believe it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as the Company is already employing similar accounting policies.

Note 3—Severance and Other Charges

During 2002, the Company recorded severance and other charges of $12.2 million ($7.7 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share). These charges
include: 1) asset impairment charges of $5.1 million, which consist of a $4.2 million write-off of the remaining intangible asset value assigned to an acquired
customer contract in Brazil, due to the loss of the customer, and a $0.8 million net write-down of the Company's collateral assignment in life insurance policies held for the
benefit of certain employees (the carrying value of our collateral assignment is the lesser of the policies' cash surrender value or the premiums paid; due to a decline in the market value of the
assets underlying these policies during 2002, the carrying value of the collateral assignment was reduced to $6.3 million at December 31, 2002);
2) a $4.0 million charge for the settlement of a class action lawsuit, net of insurance proceeds (see Note 11); and 3) severance charges of $3.2 million, due to the
reorganization of various departments. Additional severance and related costs will be incurred in 2003 as the Company downsizes its operations in Brazil, which it anticipates will occur during the
first quarter of 2003.

On
December 31, 2002, the Company completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Netzee, Inc., a provider of Internet banking products and
e-commerce solutions to community banks and credit unions, for $10.4 million in cash. Approximately $2.6 million of the purchase price was allocated to acquired net assets,
while $7.8 million was allocated to acquired technology and customer contracts. These intangible assets will be amortized over an average of five years. Pro forma results of operations have not
been presented for this acquisition because the effect of the transaction was not material to the consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2001, the Company increased its ownership in Unnisa Ltda. ("Unnisa"), a card processing business in Brazil, from 59.3 percent to 100 percent. In
August 2001, the Company acquired Accu Chek, Inc. ("Accu Chek"), a leading provider of third-party check collection services. These acquisitions had an aggregate cash purchase price of
$79.0 million, net of cash acquired, with $58.1 million allocated to goodwill, $12.1 million allocated to other intangibles, including data files and customer lists,
$4.0 million allocated to other current and long-term assets, $1.0 million of assumed liabilities, and $5.8 million for the elimination of the minority interests. If
these 2001 acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of 2000, the unaudited pro forma revenues, net income, and diluted EPS of the Company would have been $941.0 million,
$87.3 million, and $1.26, respectively, in 2001 and $873.5 million, $88.3 million, and $1.30, respectively in 2000.

In
2000, the Company increased its ownership in Equifax Card Solutions Ltd., a U.K. card processing business, from 51 percent to 100 percent, and acquired
Check-A-Cheque Ltd. and Rexora to compliment its check business in Europe and Procard S.A., a card processing business in Chile. The Company also acquired a portfolio of
credit card merchant processing accounts from Heartland Payment Systems. These acquisitions had an aggregate cash purchase price of $46.3 million, net of cash acquired, with
$24.7 million allocated to goodwill, $22.0 million allocated to merchant contracts, $1.8 million allocated to assets, and $2.2 million of assumed liabilities. If these 2000
acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of 1999, the unaudited pro forma revenues, net income, and diluted EPS of the Company would have been $917.4 million, $87.5 million, and
$1.29, respectively, in 2000.

The
above acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and their results of operations have been included in the consolidated statements of income from the dates of acquisition. The pro
forma information included in this note is based on historical results of the separate companies and may not necessarily be indicative of the results that would have been achieved or of results that
may occur in the future.

Note 5—Divestitures

In September 2000, the Company sold its 50 percent interest in its card processing operation in India for $6.9 million, which resulted in a
pre-tax gain of $2.2 million, which was recorded in other income.

Note 6—Transactions with Equifax

There were no material intercompany purchase or sale transactions between Equifax and the Company through the Distribution Date. Prior to the Distribution, the
Company advanced excess cash to Equifax under Equifax's centralized cash management system.

The
Company was charged with incremental corporate costs through the Distribution Date in the amount of $6.3 million in 2001 and $11.1 million in 2000. Approximately
$1.9 million and $3.3 million of these amounts were allocated to the Company's two operating segments in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Equifax allocations were based on an estimate of
the proportion of corporate expenses related to the Company, utilizing such factors as revenues, number of employees, and other relevant factors. Management believes that, had the Company been
operating on a full year stand-alone basis, it would have incurred additional expenses of approximately $3.2 million in 2001 and


approximately $6.5 million in 2000 which specifically relate to incremental pension expense, insurance costs, corporate headquarters rent, and stand-alone public company costs for audit,
director, and stock exchange fees. Management believes that all other costs allocated to the Company are a reasonable representation of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had
performed these functions as a stand-alone company.

In
conjunction with the Distribution, the Company and Equifax entered into various agreements that address the allocation of assets and liabilities between them and that define their
relationship after the Distribution, including the distribution agreement, the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, the employee benefits agreement, the intercompany data purchase agreement, the
intellectual property agreement, and the transition support agreement.

Note 7—Long-Term Debt

In July 2001, the Company entered into a $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks. This facility bears
interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points. This facility also contains certain financial covenants related to interest coverage and funded debt to cash flow, and borrowings under this
facility are guaranteed by the Company's subsidiaries. Borrowings were made on this facility to fund a $275 million payment to Equifax in conjunction with the Distribution. It is also available
to meet working capital and acquisition needs, if necessary. Outstanding amounts are due upon the expiration date of the facility in July 2004; therefore, the Company classifies the outstanding
balance as long-term debt. The Company had $214.2 million and $230.0 million outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The
Company entered into several interest rate swap arrangements in 2002 that fix the interest rate on $100 million of variable rate revolver borrowings from January 2003
to July 2003 at 2.865 percent, an additional $50 million from April 2003 to July 2003 at 2.940 percent, and $100 million from July 2003 to
January 2004 at 3.350 percent. These derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges, were documented as fully effective, and at December 31, 2002, were valued as a liability
totaling $0.8 million.

Also
in July 2001, the Company entered into a 364-day $100 million unsecured revolving credit facility with the same group of commercial banks. This facility
provided interest rates tied to LIBOR and contained certain financial covenants related to interest coverage and funded debt to cash flow, and borrowings under this facility were guaranteed by the
Company's subsidiaries. This facility was not renewed upon its expiration in July 2002. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2001.

The
Company also has an unsecured revolving credit facility that provides advances up to $130 million to finance its customers' shortfalls in the daily funding requirements
associated with the Company's credit and debit card settlement operations (Note 2). Outstanding borrowings on this credit facility are classified as part of the Company's settlement payables in
the consolidated balance sheets. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. Approximately $10.5 million was outstanding at December 31, 2001,
which was repaid on January 2, 2002.

Note 8—Income Taxes

Prior to the Distribution Date, the Company was included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Equifax. Tax provisions were settled through the
intercompany accounts and Equifax made income tax payments on behalf of the Company. The Company's provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income reflects federal, state, and
foreign income taxes for periods through June 30, 2001 calculated using the separate return basis. All income tax amounts related to periods prior to the Distribution Date have been settled
with Equifax. Future adjustments, if any, to such periods will be settled in accordance with the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement.


During
2002, the Company determined that its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries are permanently invested and will not be repatriated to the U.S. in the foreseeable future.
Future U.S. tax consequences on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries are no longer considered in the tax provision calculation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 23. At December 31,
2002, there are approximately $4.9 million of undistributed net earnings for which no additional U.S. tax is provided.

The
Company records deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recorded based on the differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.

A
valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company established a valuation allowance in
the amount of $2.5 million during 2002 for foreign tax credit carryforwards generated in 2002. The level of foreign tax credits in 2002 was higher than normal due to a one time intercompany
transaction with Brazil. The Company is reviewing several planning options related to this carryforward, but comparisons of future expected foreign tax credit generation and utilization tend to
indicate that the Company may not recover all of the current year foreign tax credit carryforwards. Approximately $0.5 million of the Company's foreign tax credit carryforwards expire in 2006,
while the remaining $2.5 million of carryforwards expire in 2007. The net operating loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date.

Note 9—Shareholders' Equity

Equifax Equity Investment.

Equifax's equity investment included the original investments in the Company, accumulated income
of the Company through the Distribution Date, and the dividend to Equifax arising from the forgiveness of the net intercompany receivable due from Equifax reflecting transactions described in
Note 6.

Treasury Stock.

In September 2001, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $100 million in common stock
repurchases primarily to offset share issuances associated with employee stock-based compensation. During 2002 and 2001, the Company repurchased 3.4 million and 81,400, respectively, of its own
common shares through open market transactions at an aggregate investment of $79.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively. At December 31, 2002, approximately $18.0 million
remained available


for future purchases. During 2002 and 2001, the Company reissued 295,900 and 81,400 shares in connection with employee stock option exercises and restricted stock awards.

Rights Plan.

In June 2001, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (the "Rights Plan"). The
Rights Plan contains provisions to protect the Company's shareholders in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire the Company, including offers that do not treat all shareholders equally, the
acquisition in the open market of shares constituting control without offering fair value to all shareholders, and other coercive, unfair or inadequate takeover bids and practices that could impair
the ability of the Board of Directors to represent shareholders' interests fully. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one Share Purchase Right (a "Right") for
each outstanding share of the Company's common stock, with distribution to be made to shareholders of record as of July 6, 2001. The Rights, which will expire on July 6, 2011, initially
will be represented by, and traded together with, the Company's common stock. The Rights are not currently exercisable and do not become exercisable unless certain triggering events occur. Among the
triggering events is the acquisition of 20 percent or more of the Company's common stock by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons. Unless previously redeemed, upon the
occurrence of one of the specified triggering events, each Right that is not held by the 20 percent or more shareholder will entitle its holder to purchase one share of common stock or, under
certain circumstances, additional shares of common stock at a discounted price.

Stock Options.

Historically, the Company participated in Equifax's stock option plans, which provided qualified and
nonqualified stock options to officers and employees at exercise prices not less than market value on the date of grant. In connection with the Distribution, stock options under these plans held by
employees of the Company that were not exercised prior to the Distribution Date were replaced with options of Certegy. In accordance with the provisions of FIN 44, "Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation" ("FIN 44"), Equifax stock options were replaced with Certegy stock options in amounts and at exercise prices intended to preserve the economic benefit of the
Equifax stock options at such time. Accordingly, no compensation expense resulted from the replacement of the options. The exercise price of the replacement options ranges from
$5.79–$31.52.

In
June 2001, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the Certegy Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the "Employee Stock Plan"), pursuant to which 6.6 million shares of
authorized but unissued common stock have been reserved. Under the provisions of the Employee Stock Plan, the number of shares available for grant is increased each January through 2008 based on the
number of common shares issued and outstanding. The Employee Stock Plan provides that qualified and nonqualified stock options may be granted to officers and employees at exercise prices not less than
market value on the date of grant. Generally, options vest over a three-year period and are exercisable for ten years from the date of grant. The Employee Stock Plan also provides for
awards of restricted shares of the Company's common stock. Additionally, the Company adopted the Certegy Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan
(the "Director Stock Plan"), pursuant to which 200,000 shares of stock are available for grant to non-employee directors in the form of stock options. At December 31, 2002, there
were approximately 2.0 million and 174,000 shares available for future option grants and


restricted stock awards under the Employee Stock Plan and the Director Stock Plan, respectively. The following is a summary of the stock option activity during 2002 and 2001:

Pro Forma Information.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
("SFAS 123"), the Company has elected to apply APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize
compensation cost in connection with its stock option plans. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost for these plans based on the fair value at the replacement date and grant dates
as prescribed by SFAS 123, net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts:

Pro
forma net income for 2000 noted above is based on the fair value of Equifax options held by the Company's employees. Because the SFAS 123 fair value disclosure requirements
apply only to options granted after December 31, 1994, the resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to be expected in future years.

Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The Company's Board of Directors adopted the Certegy Inc. Key Management
Long-Term Incentive Plan for certain key officers that provides for cash awards at the end of various length measurement periods based on the growth in earnings per share and/or various
other criteria over the measurement period. For certain awards, the employee may elect to receive some or all of their distribution as an equity interest in the Company. Expense for this plan can vary
between years due to revisions of estimates of future distributions under the plan, which are based on the likelihood that the performance criteria will be met. The total expense under this plan was
$0.9 million and $0.8 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Deferred Compensation.

In 2002, the Company granted 287,000 shares of performance-accelerated restricted stock to officers
and other key employees under the Employee Stock Plan. The shares become fully vested at the end of a 36-month vesting period if certain performance criteria are met. Otherwise, the shares
vest at the end of a 72-month period. In August 2001, the Company granted approximately 133,000 shares of restricted stock to officers and other key employees, which become fully
vested at the end of a 30-month vesting period. These restricted stock grants were recorded as deferred compensation, a reduction of shareholders' equity, based on the quoted fair market
value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense associated with these awards can fluctuate each year based on the likelihood that the performance criteria will be met. During
2002, approximately 22,800 restricted shares were cancelled. Compensation expense for restricted stock was $3.6 million in 2002 and $0.7 million in 2001.

Note 10—Employee Benefits

Prior to the Distribution, the Company participated in the Equifax employee benefit plans and was allocated a portion of the plans' costs based on an estimate of
the proportion of expense related to the Company. In the opinion of management, the expenses were allocated on a reasonable basis. Effective


on the Distribution Date, the Company established its own plans, which provide benefits similar to those benefits provided under Equifax's plans.

Retirement Plan.

The Equifax noncontributory qualified retirement plan covered most U.S. salaried employees. Benefits were
primarily a function of salary and years of service. The Equifax plan provisions and funding met the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Total pension
income allocated to the Company and included in the consolidated statements of income was $2.1 million for the period from January 1, 2001 through the Distribution Date and
$3.3 million in 2000. The components of pension income other than service costs, which were allocated directly, were allocated to the Company in proportion to total payroll costs. Effective on
the Distribution Date, the Company established the Certegy noncontributory qualified retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan") and Equifax transferred to this plan a proportionate share of assets

Employee Retirement Savings Plan.

The Equifax retirement savings plan provided for annual contributions, within specified
ranges, determined at the discretion of the Equifax Board of Directors, for the benefit of eligible employees in the form of cash or shares of Equifax's common stock. Effective on the Distribution
Date, the Company established its own employee retirement savings plan, with substantially the same terms as the Equifax plan and annual contributions made in the form of Certegy's common stock. The
Company's expense for these plans was $1.4 million in 2002, $1.1 million in 2001, and $1.1 million in 2000.

The
Company also maintains various defined contribution plans for certain employees in its international locations. Expenses for these plans were not material.


Postretirement Benefit Plans.

The Equifax unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans covered eligible retired
employees. Substantially all U.S. employees became eligible for these benefits if they reached normal retirement age while working for Equifax and satisfied certain years of service requirements.
Equifax accrued the cost of providing these benefits over the active service period of the employee. Expenses of $0.4 million for the period from January 1, 2001 through the Distribution
Date and $0.5 million in 2000 were allocated to the Company in proportion to total payroll costs. Effective on
the Distribution Date, the Company established its own postretirement benefit plans with substantially the same terms as the Equifax plans, and Equifax transferred to this plan a proportionate share
of the accrued liability for the Company's participants under the Equifax plans. Expenses for these plans were $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, and $0.1 million
for the period from the Distribution Date through December 31, 2001. The accrued liability for these plans at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $3.0 million and $2.7 million,
respectively, which is included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The assumed discount rate used in accounting for the plan was 7.0 percent in 2002
and 7.5 percent in 2001.

Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies

Leases.

The Company's operating leases involve principally office space and office equipment. Rental expense relating to
these leases was $9.4 million in 2002, $9.1 million in 2001, and $12.6 million in 2000.

Future
minimum payment obligations for noncancelable operating leases exceeding one year are as follows as of December 31, 2002:

The
Company has two operating leases, under which it has guaranteed the residual value of the leased properties to the lessors. In the event the properties are sold by the lessors at the
end of the lease terms, the Company would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds under $26.2 million, which approximates 79 percent of the value of the properties at the
beginning of the lease terms. Management believes the fair market values of these properties exceed the amount of the guarantees. The Company has entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to fix
the variable interest rate on one of these lease obligations (Note 2).

Data Processing Services Agreements.

The Company has separate agreements with EDS, IBM, and Proceda, which expire between
2006 and 2012, for portions of its computer data processing operations and related functions. The estimated aggregate contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is approximately
$206.5 million as of December 31, 2002. However, this amount could be more or less depending on various factors such as the inflation rate, the introduction of significant new
technologies, or changes in the Company's data processing needs as a result of acquisitions or divestitures. Under certain circumstances, such as a change in control of the Company or for the
Company's convenience, the Company may terminate these agreements. However, the agreements provide that the Company must pay a termination charge in the event of such a termination.


Change in Control Agreements.

The Company has agreements with certain of its officers, which provide certain severance pay
and benefits in the event of a termination of the officer's employment under certain circumstances following a "change in control" of the Company. "Change in control" is defined as the accumulation by
any person, entity, or group of 20 percent or more of the combined voting power of the Company's voting stock or the occurrence of certain other specified events. In the event of a "change in
control," vesting periods and payouts under the Stock Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan are accelerated.

Litigation.

A number of lawsuits seeking damages are brought against the Company each year in the ordinary course of business. In the
opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial position, liquidity, or results
of operations. The Company provides for estimated legal fees and settlements relating to pending lawsuits.

A
class action lawsuit entitled Gary and Nancy Ballard, et. al. v. Equifax Check Services, Inc. (now known as Certegy Check Services, Inc.) was filed against the Company in
August 1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. This lawsuit was based on a claim that, during the period August 1992 through December 31, 1996, the
Company improperly assessed a service charge on unpaid checks, which allegedly violated provisions of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and California's Unfair Business Practices Act. The
action sought, among other remedies, a refund of all service charges collected from California consumers during this period, prejudgment interest, statutory damages under the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, and attorneys' fees. These amounts in the aggregate could have exceeded $18 million if the plaintiffs had prevailed in the case. In November 2002, the Company entered into
a Memorandum of Understanding with the plaintiffs
providing for a settlement whereby the Company will pay $3.975 million (or $0.035 per diluted share), net of amounts covered under a Letter of Agreement with its insurance carriers, to the
plaintiffs in exchange for a full and final release of all claims asserted. The parties are currently proceeding to obtain approval of the settlement by the Court. Once the Court grants preliminary
approval of the settlement, the Company is required to remit the funds to a trust within 30 days, which will then be distributed to the plaintiffs once final approval is granted. The Company
accrued the settlement amount, which is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002.
