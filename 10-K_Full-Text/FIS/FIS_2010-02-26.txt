PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Narrative
    Description of the Business

FIS is a leading global provider of banking and payments
    technology solutions, processing services and information-based
    services. We offer financial institution core processing, card
    issuer and transaction processing services, including the NYCE
    Network, a leading national electronic funds transfer (EFT)
    network. FIS is a member of the Standard and Poor’s
    (S&P)

®

Index and consistently holds a leading ranking in the annual
    FinTech 100 rankings.

As of December 31, 2009, FIS has more than 300 solutions
    serving over 14,000 financial institutions and business
    customers in over 100 countries spanning most segments of the
    financial services industry. These customers include 40 of the
    top 50 global banks, including nine of the top 10, as ranked by
    Bankersalmanac.com as of November 2009, as well as mid-tier and
    community banks, credit unions, commercial lenders, automotive
    financial institutions, healthcare providers and governments.
    Additionally, we provide services to numerous retailers via our
    check processing and guarantee services. No individual customer
    represents more than 5% of our revenues.

On October 1, 2009, FIS completed the acquisition of
    Metavante. The resulting combination of solution suites is
    expected to strengthen our competitive position globally,
    generates substantial economies of scale and provides
    significant cross-sell opportunities. Metavante expands the
    scale of FIS core processing and payment capabilities, adds
    comprehensive trust and wealth management services and includes
    the NYCE Network, which joins the Company’s existing EFT
    offerings. In addition, Metavante adds significant scale to our
    treasury and cash management offerings and provides an entry
    into the emerging markets of healthcare and government payments.
    These enhanced capabilities enable FIS to provide a selection of
    solutions to financial institutions across all asset sizes, and
    to a variety of non-financial organizations, both domestically
    and internationally. FIS is now well positioned in both the
    large and mid-tier bank segments, where the majority of IT
    spending occurs.

General
    Development of the Business

Our business operations and organizational structure result from
    the February 1, 2006, business combination of FIS and
    Certegy (the “Certegy Merger”), pursuant to which FIS
    was merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Certegy.
    Immediately after the Certegy Merger, the stockholders of FIS
    owned approximately 67.4% of the Company’s outstanding
    common stock. Accordingly, for accounting and financial
    reporting purposes, the Certegy Merger was treated as a reverse
    acquisition of Certegy by FIS using the purchase method of
    accounting. Under this accounting treatment, although Certegy
    was the legal entity that survived the merger, FIS was viewed as
    the acquirer for accounting purposes, and our financial
    statements and other disclosures for periods prior to the
    Certegy Merger treat FIS as our predecessor company. Also, as a
    result of the Certegy Merger, the registrant’s name changed
    from “Certegy Inc.” to “Fidelity National
    Information Services, Inc.” and our New York Stock Exchange
    trading symbol from “CEY” to “FIS”. We are
    incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia, where
    Certegy was initially incorporated on March 2, 2001.



On November 9, 2006, Old FNF, then the majority stockholder
    of FIS (after other transactions in which it distributed all of
    its assets other than its ownership in FIS), merged with and
    into FIS (the “FNF Merger”). Upon completion of the
    FNF Merger, FIS became an independent publicly traded company,
    and Old FNF ceased to exist as an independent publicly traded
    company. The assets distributed by Old FNF prior to the FNF
    Merger included its ownership in FNT, which following the FNF
    Merger renamed itself Fidelity National Financial, Inc.

Our growth has been driven internally and by these additional
    acquisitions which also contributed important applications and
    services to the offerings of FIS:

•

eFunds, a provider of risk management services, EFT services,
    prepaid/gift card processing, and global outsourcing solutions
    to financial services companies in the U.S. and
    internationally;

•

Certegy, a provider of card issuer services to financial
    institutions and check risk management services in the
    U.S. and internationally;

•

InterCept, Inc., a provider of outsourced and in-house core
    banking solutions, as well as item processing and check imaging
    services;

•

Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc., a provider of software and
    outsourcing solutions to banks and other financial institutions;

•

Kordoba, a provider of information technology solutions for the
    financial services industry with a focus on services and
    solutions for the German banking market;

•

Aurum Technology, a provider of software and outsourcing
    solutions to community banks and credit unions; and

•

The financial services division of ALLTEL Information Services,
    Inc., a provider of core banking services.

Financial
    Information About Operating Segments and Geographic
    Areas

On July 2, 2008, we completed the spin-off of our former
    lender processing services segment into a separate publicly
    traded company, Lender Processing Services, Inc., referred to as
    LPS. The results of operations of the lender processing services
    segment are reflected as discontinued operations in the
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented.
    Subsequent to the LPS spin-off, we began reporting the results
    of our operations in four new reporting segments:
    1) Financial Solutions Group (“FSG”);
    2) Payment Solutions Group (“PSG”);
    3) International Solutions Group (“ISG”); and
    4) Corporate and Other. All periods presented have been
    conformed to reflect the segment changes.

Competitive
    Strengths

We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:

•

Leading Proprietary Technology —

FIS has a
    significant number of high quality software applications and
    services that have been developed over many years with
    substantial input from our customers.

•

Comprehensive, Integrated Business Solutions

—
    FIS has the ability to use a wide range of applications and
    services to provide comprehensive business solutions for our
    customers. In addition, FIS is able to use the modular nature of
    our software applications and our ability to integrate many of
    our services with the services of others to provide customized
    solutions that respond to individualized customer needs. FIS
    also offers a wider range of flexible service arrangements than
    are typically offered by our competitors for the deployment and
    support of our software, from traditional license and
    maintenance fee approaches to managed processing arrangements,
    either at the customer’s site or at an FIS location.

•

Excellent Relationship with Customers

— A
    significant percentage of FIS’ business with our customers
    relates to core processing applications and services, and the
    nature of this relationship allows us to develop close
    partnerships with these customers. As the breadth of FIS’
    service offerings expands, we have found that our access to key
    customer personnel is increasing, presenting greater
    opportunities for cross-selling.

•

Strong Value Proposition for Customers

— We
    understand the needs of our customers and have developed
    innovative services that can reduce their operating costs.



Strategy

Our mission is to achieve profitable growth through providing
    superior solutions to our customers. Our strategy to achieve
    this has been and will continue to be built on the following
    pillars:

•

Solution Integration and Innovation

— Continue
    to invest in internally developed applications and platforms.
    Enhancing and extending the functionality of our proprietary
    systems and developing new and innovative applications in
    response to market needs are essential elements to achieving our
    growth objectives.

•

Superior Execution

— Deliver value using
    industry best practices more economically than customers can
    perform the same services internally.

•

Enterprise Sales

— Leverage opportunities for
    cross-selling and up-selling to existing customers. FIS has
    built a centralized team of experienced sales personnel that
    capitalizes on these opportunities.

•

Global Diversification

— Continue to deploy
    resources in emerging global markets with higher revenue growth
    potential.

•

Strategic Acquisitions

— Focus on acquisitions
    that can bring new applications to existing markets we serve or
    provide entry into new markets. This strategy has allowed us to
    build a very broad solutions suite and will contribute to
    maintaining our competitive position going forward.

•

Expense Management

— Continue to drive
    operating efficiencies, thereby freeing resources for strategic
    innovation and global diversification efforts.

    Solutions Group

The focus of FSG is to provide the most comprehensive software
    and services for the core processing, customer channel,
    treasury, cash management and wealth management operations of
    our financial institution customers in North America. We service
    the core and related ancillary processing needs of North
    American banks, credit unions, automotive financial companies,
    commercial lenders, and independent community and savings
    institutions. FIS offers a broad selection of in-house and
    outsourced solutions to banking customers that span the range of
    asset sizes. FSG customers are typically committed under
    multi-year contracts that provide a stable, recurring revenue
    base and opportunities for cross-selling additional financial
    and payments offerings.

We employ several business models to provide our solutions to
    our customers. We typically deliver the highest value to our
    customers when we combine our software applications and deliver
    them in one of several types of outsourcing arrangements, such
    as an application service provider, facilities management
    processing or an application management arrangement. We are also
    able to deliver individual applications through a software
    licensing arrangement. Based upon the expertise gained through
    the foregoing arrangements, some clients also use us to manage
    their IT operations without providing any of our proprietary
    software.

Our solutions in this segment include:

•

Core Processing and Ancillary
    Applications.

Our core processing software
    applications are designed to run critical banking processes for
    our financial institution clients, including deposit and lending
    systems,



customer management, and other central management systems. Our
    diverse selection of market-focused core systems enables FIS to
    effectively compete in a wide range of markets. We also offer a
    number of services that are ancillary to the primary
    applications listed above, including branch automation, back
    office support systems and compliance support. In addition, our
    wealth management services offer a set of Internet-enabled
    services to financial services providers that address the
    specific needs of the rapidly growing wealthy, affluent and
    emerging affluent markets, as well as commercial clients. These
    solutions address asset and liability aggregation, trust and
    investment account management, client and regulatory reporting,
    and employee retirement benefit services. We also offer an
    application suite that assists automotive finance institutions
    in evaluating loan applications and credit risk, and allows
    automotive finance institutions to manage their loan and lease
    portfolios.

•

Channel Solutions.

Our comprehensive suite of
    retail delivery applications enables financial institutions to
    integrate and streamline customer-facing operations and
    back-office processes, thereby improving customer interaction
    across all channels (e.g., branch offices, Internet, ATM, call
    centers). The FIS focus on consumer access has driven
    significant market innovation in this area, with multi-channel
    and multi-host solutions and a strategy that provides tight
    integration of services and a seamless customer experience. Our
    electronic banking services are utilized by more than 2,100
    financial institutions to offer Internet banking services to
    their customers. Our Consumer Electronic Banking and Business
    Internet Banking both provide an extensive set of cash
    management capabilities, enabling customers to manage banking
    and payments through the Internet, mobile devices, accounting
    software and telephone. Corporate Electronic Banking solutions
    provide commercial treasury capabilities including cash
    management services and multi-bank and collection and
    disbursement services that address the specialized needs of
    corporate customers. FIS systems provide full accounting and
    reconciliation for such transactions, serving as the system of
    record and providing full regulatory compliance, risk assessment
    and fraud management tools.

•

Decision and Risk Management Solutions.

Our
    decision solutions offer a full spectrum of options that cover
    the account lifecycle from helping to identify qualified account
    applicants to managing mature customer accounts and fraud. Our
    applications include know-your-customer, new account
    decisioning, new account opening, account and transaction
    management, fraud management and collections. Our risk
    management services utilize our proprietary risk management
    models and data sources to assist in detecting fraud and
    assessing the risk of opening a new account or accepting a check
    at either the

point-of-sale,

a physical branch location, or through the Internet. Our systems
    utilize a combination of advanced authentication procedures,
    predictive analytics, artificial intelligence modeling and
    proprietary and shared databases to assess and detect fraud risk
    for deposit transactions for financial institutions.

•

Syndicated Loan Applications.

Our syndicated
    loan applications are designed to support wholesale and
    commercial banking requirements necessary for all aspects of
    syndicated commercial loan origination and management.

•

Global Commercial Services.

Our global
    commercial services include solutions, both onshore and
    offshore, designed to meet the technology challenges facing
    principally U.S. based clients, large or small. Our
    technology solutions range in scope from consulting engagements
    to application development projects and from operations support
    for a single application to full management of information
    technology infrastructures. We also provide outsourcing teams to
    manage costs, improve operational efficiency, transform
    processes and deliver world-class customer service. There is an
    increased trend toward outsourcing in our customer base, thus
    expansion of these services represents one of FIS’ growth
    drivers.

    the EFT, card processing, item processing, bill payment, and
    government and healthcare payments processing needs of our

    headquartered banks and credit unions, commercial lenders, and
    independent community and savings institutions. With the

    revenues based on underlying payment transaction volumes.

Our electronic
    funds transfer and debit card processing business offers
    settlement and card management solutions for financial
    institution card issuers. We provide traditional ATM- and

    financial institutions, retailers and independent ATM operators

    security of electronic real-time payments, real-time

    These include costs related to human resources, finance, legal,

    expertise in particular services or the needs of particular
    types of customers, e.g., financial institutions, other
    nonbanking customers, and international institutions. This
    organizational structure enables us to effectively bring
    additional solutions to the attention of our existing customers,
    leveraging opportunities to cross-sell and up-sell. We target
    the majority of our potential customers via direct

and/or

indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound
    telemarketing efforts.

Our global marketing strategy is to develop and lead the
    execution of the various business units’ strategic
    marketing plans in support of their revenue and profitability
    goals. Key components include thought leadership, consistent
    message development, internal and external communications,
    client conference content management, Web content creation and
    management, trade shows, demand generation campaign involvement
    and collateral development and management. We strive to use the
    most efficient delivery system available to successfully acquire
    clients and build awareness of our solutions.



Beginning October 1, 2009, we entered into a comprehensive
    rebranding campaign to bring all of our software and services
    under one comprehensive set of trademarks, including FIS and
    NYCE, in support of our marketing strategy.

Patents,
    Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal
    security practices, and applicable law to establish and protect
    our software, technology and expertise worldwide. We rely on
    trademark law to protect our rights in those brands. While we
    intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our
    intellectual property rights, these legal protections and
    arrangements afford only limited protection, and there is no
    assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or
    license products, services, or capabilities that are
    substantially equivalent or superior to ours. In general, we own
    the proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our
    business, although we do license certain items from third
    parties under arms-length agreements for varying terms.

Competition

Our primary competitors include internal technology departments
    within financial institutions and retailers, data processing or
    software development departments of large companies or large
    computer manufacturers, third-party payment processors,
    independent computer services firms, companies that develop and
    deploy software applications, companies that provide customized
    development, implementation and support services and companies
    that market software for the financial services industry. Some
    of these competitors possess substantially greater financial,
    sales and marketing resources than we do. Competitive factors
    impacting the success of our services include the quality of the
    technology-based application or service, application features
    and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the
    provider to maintain, enhance, and support the applications or
    services, and price. We believe that we compete favorably in
    each of these categories. In addition, we believe that our
    financial institution industry expertise, combined with our
    ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated
    solutions to individual customers, enhances our competitiveness
    against companies with more limited offerings. Specific
    competitors for both financial and payment solutions include
    Fiserv, Inc. and Jack Henry and Associates, Inc. In the core
    processing market, we also compete with Open Solutions, Inc.,
    International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Accenture
    Ltd., Alliance Data Systems Corporation, DST Systems, Harland
    Financial Solutions, Inc., SEI Investments Company,
    S1Corporation, SunGard Data Systems, Inc. and in certain

non-U.S. markets,

Alnova Technologies Corporation, I-Flex Solutions Limited n/k/a
    Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, Misys plc, Infosys
    Technologies Limited and Temenos Group AG. Our competitors in
    the card services market include MasterCard Incorporated, Visa
    Inc., and third-party credit and debit card processors, such as
    First Data Corporation, Total System Services, Inc., HP
    Enterprise Services and Payment Systems for Credit Unions
    (PSCU). Competitors in the check risk management services market
    include First Data Corporation’s TeleCheck Services
    division, Heartland Payments Systems, Inc., Total Systems
    Services, Inc. and Global Payments, Inc.

Research
    and Development

Our research and development activities have related primarily
    to the design and development of processing systems and related
    software applications and risk management platforms. We expect
    to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of
    resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of
    our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to
    develop new and innovative software applications and systems in
    response to the needs of our customers, and to enhance the
    capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure. In
    addition, we intend to offer services that are compatible with
    new and emerging delivery channels.

As part of our research and development process, we evaluate
    current and emerging technology for compatibility with our
    existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage
    with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of
    various infrastructure components. Where appropriate, we use
    third-party technology components in the development of our
    software applications and service offerings. Third-party
    software may be used for highly specialized business functions,
    which we may not be able to develop internally within time and
    budget constraints. Additionally, third-party software may be
    used for commodity type functions within a technology platform
    environment. In the case of nearly all of our third-party
    software, enterprise license agreements



exist for the third-party component and either alternative
    suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the
    continuity of supply. As a result, we are not materially
    dependent upon any third-party technology components. We work
    with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and
    approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to
    our applications and services. In the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately 2% to 3% of
    revenues were invested in research and development efforts
    (excluding amounts capitalized).

Government
    Regulation

Our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal,
    state, and foreign regulation, including federal

truth-in-lending

and

truth-in-savings

rules, Regulation AA (Unfair or Deceptive Acts or
    Practices), privacy laws, usury laws, the Equal Credit
    Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair
    Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,
    the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Internal Revenue
    Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health
    Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Community
    Reinvestment Act. The compliance of our services with these and
    other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of
    factors, including the manner in which our clients use them. Our
    clients are contractually responsible for determining what is
    required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that
    we can assist them in their compliance efforts. The failure of
    our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations
    could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them, as
    well as the imposition of civil fines

and/or

criminal penalties. The four principal areas of regulation
    impacting our business are:

•

Privacy.

Our financial institution clients are
    required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These regulations place restrictions on
    the use of non-public personal information. All financial
    institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their
    customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial
    institution not to share information with third parties. The
    regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share
    information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for
    the financial institutions. As a provider of services to
    financial institutions, we are required to comply with the
    privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on
    disclosure of the information received from our customers as
    apply to the financial institutions themselves.

•

Consumer Reporting.

Our retail check
    authorization services (Certegy Check Services) and account
    opening services (ChexSystems) maintain databases of consumer
    information and, as a consequence, are subject to the Federal
    Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state laws. Among other
    things, the Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes requirements on us
    concerning data accuracy, and provides that consumers have the
    right to know the contents of their files, to dispute their
    accuracy, and to require verification or removal of disputed
    information. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy,
    fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers’
    personal information, and compliance with these laws, we
    maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in
    which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations
    call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer
    requests for information and handling disputes.

•

Debt Collection.

Our collection services are
    subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and
    various state collection laws and licensing requirements. The
    Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and
    other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the
    collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.

•

Money Transfer.

Elements of our cash access
    and money transmission businesses are registered as a Money
    Services Business and are subject to the USA Patriot Act and
    reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and
    U.S. Treasury Regulations. This business is also subject to
    various state, local and tribal licensing requirements. The
    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general,
    and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws
    relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and
    licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that
    require entities engaged in money transmission and the sale of
    stored value cards to register as a money transmitter with that
    jurisdiction’s banking department.

As a provider of electronic data processing and back-office
    services to financial institutions we are also subject to
    regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial
    Institutions Examination Council, an interagency body of the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift
    Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller



of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
    System, the National Credit Union Administration and various
    state regulatory authorities. In addition, independent auditors
    annually review several of our operations to provide reports on
    internal controls for our customers’ auditors and
    regulators. We are also subject to review under state and
    foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities
    that are described above, including electronic data processing
    and back-office services for financial institutions and use of
    consumer information.

The foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company
    is subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework
    governing our operations changes continuously. Although we do
    not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations
    related to our businesses will have a material adverse effect on
    our company, enactment of new laws and regulations may
    increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly and
    indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory
    compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity,

and/or

loss
    of revenue.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    31,000 employees, including approximately
    16,000 employees principally employed outside of the
    U.S. None of our U.S. workforce currently is
    unionized. Approximately 10,000 of our employees, primarily in
    Brazil and Germany, are represented by labor unions. We consider
    our relations with employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to
    significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed
    below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Risks
    Related to Our Markets and Industry

Consolidations
    and failures in the banking and financial services industry
    could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our
    existing and potential customers and making us more dependent on
    a more limited number of customers.

There has been and continues to be substantial consolidation
    activity in the banking and financial services industry. In
    addition, many financial institutions that experienced negative
    operating results, including some of our customers, have failed.

The consolidations and failures reduce the number of our
    customers and potential customers, which could adversely affect
    our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate
    activities of the consolidated entities. Further, if our
    customers fail

and/or

merge
    with or are acquired by other entities that are not our
    customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may
    discontinue or reduce use of our services. It is also possible
    that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations
    would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide
    to perform in-house some or all of the services which we
    currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.



If we
    fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the
    marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology
    are not successful, we could lose customers and have difficulty
    attracting new customers for our services.

The markets for our services are characterized by constant
    technological changes, frequent introductions of new services
    and evolving industry standards. Our future success will be
    significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current
    services, and develop and introduce new services that address
    the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their
    clients. These initiatives carry the risks associated with any
    new service development effort, including cost overruns, delays
    in delivery, and performance issues. There can be no assurance
    that we will be successful in developing, marketing and selling
    new services that meet these changing demands, that we will not
    experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the
    successful development, introduction, and marketing of these
    services, or that our new services and their enhancements will
    adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve
    market acceptance. Any of these developments could have an
    adverse impact on our future revenues

and/or

business prospects.

We
    operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are
    unable to compete effectively our results of operations and
    financial condition may be adversely affected.

The market for our services is intensely competitive. Our
    competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the
    services they offer. Some of our competitors have substantial
    resources. We face direct competition from third parties, and
    since many of our larger potential customers have historically
    developed their key applications in-house and therefore view
    their system requirements from a make-versus-buy perspective, we
    often compete against our potential customers’ in-house
    capacities. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we
    compete will continue to attract new competitors and new
    technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    compete successfully against current or future competitors or
    that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which
    we operate will not materially adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

Potential
    customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor, which may
    adversely affect our growth, both in the U.S. and
    internationally.

For banks and other potential customers of our financial
    information software and services, switching from one vendor of
    bank core processing or related software and services (or from
    an internally-developed system) to a new vendor is a significant
    undertaking. Many potential customers perceive potential
    disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality,
    increased costs (including conversion costs) and business
    disruption. As a result, potential customers, both in the
    U.S. and internationally, may resist change. We seek to
    overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such
    as a defined conversion process, system integration and making
    ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our
    software. However, there can be no assurance that our strategies
    for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change
    vendors will be successful, and this resistance may adversely
    affect our growth, both in the U.S. and internationally.

Demand
    for many of our services is sensitive to the level of consumer
    transactions generated by our customers, and accordingly, our
    revenues could be impacted negatively by business cycles,
    consumer confidence or any other event causing a material
    slowing of consumer spending.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction
    processing fees. Any changes in economic factors or consumer
    confidence, such as the current recession, that adversely affect
    consumer spending and related consumer debt, or a reduction in
    check writing or credit and debit card usage, could reduce the
    volume of transactions that we process, and have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.



We
    have a long sales cycle for many of our applications and if we
    fail to close sales after expending significant time and
    resources to do so, our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

The implementation of many of our applications often involves
    significant capital commitments by our customers, particularly
    those with smaller operational scale. Potential customers
    generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of
    available software and require us to expend substantial time,
    effort, and money educating them as to the value of our software
    and services. Our sales cycle may be extended due to our
    customers’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons. We
    may expend significant funds and management resources during the
    sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale. If we are
    unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds
    and management resources or we experience delays, it could have
    a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    and results of operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Business and Operations

Losses,
    consolidations and failures in the financial services industry
    may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our
    lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate
    swap agreements.

Many financial institutions are currently experiencing negative
    operating results. In some cases, these negative operating
    results have led to financial institution failures

and/or

consolidations, including, in one instance, a lender that is
    party to our Credit Agreement and interest rate swap agreements.
    As a result, lenders may become insolvent or further tighten
    lending standards, which could in turn make it more difficult or
    impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our
    interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our
    Credit Agreement, obtain financing on favorable terms, or obtain
    financing or interest rate swap agreements at all. Our financial
    condition and results of operations could be adversely affected
    if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations
    under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw
    funds under our Credit Agreement or obtain other cost-effective
    financing.

Our
    existing levels of leverage and debt service requirements may
    adversely affect our financial and operational
    flexibility.

As of December 31, 2009, we had total debt of approximately
    $3.3 billion. This level of debt could have adverse
    consequences for our business, financial condition, operating
    results and operational flexibility, including the following:
    (i) the debt level may cause us to have difficulty
    borrowing money in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; (ii) limiting
    operational flexibility and our ability to pursue other business
    opportunities and implement certain business strategies;
    (iii) we use a large portion of our operating cash flow to
    pay principal and interest on our senior credit facilities,
    which reduces the amount of money available to finance
    operations, acquisitions and other business activities, repay
    other indebtedness, purchase our outstanding stock and pay
    shareholder dividends; (iv) some of our debt has a variable
    rate of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increased
    interest rates; and (v) we have a higher level of debt than
    some of our competitors or potential competitors, which may
    cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in
    responding to changing business and economic conditions,
    including increased competition.

In addition, the terms of our senior credit facilities may
    restrict us from taking actions, such as making significant
    acquisitions or dispositions or entering into certain
    agreements, which we might believe to be advantageous to us.

We may
    experience defects, development delays, installation
    difficulties, system failure, or other service disruptions with
    respect to our technology solutions, which would harm our
    business and reputation and expose us to potential
    liability.

Many of our services are based on sophisticated software and
    computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing
    new technology solutions and services. Further, the technology
    solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained
    and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when
    first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition,
    we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our
    technologies on platforms used by our customers. Finally, our
    systems and operations could be exposed to



damage or interruption from fire, natural disaster, power loss,
    telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry and computer
    viruses. Defects in our technology solutions, errors or delays
    in the processing of electronic transactions, or other
    difficulties could result in: (i) interruption of business
    operations; (ii) delay in market acceptance;
    (iii) additional development and remediation costs;
    (iv) diversion of technical and other resources;
    (v) loss of customers; (vi) negative publicity; or
    (vii) exposure to liability claims.

Any one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability
    through disclaimers and

limitation-of-liability

provisions in our license and customer agreements, we cannot be
    certain that these measures will always be successful in
    limiting our liability.

Our
    revenues from the sale of services to members of VISA,
    MasterCard, American Express, Discover and other similar
    organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and
    sponsorship, and the loss or suspension of certification or
    sponsorship could adversely affect our business.

In order to provide our card processing services, we must be
    certified (including applicable sponsorship) by Visa,
    MasterCard, American Express, Discover and other similar
    organizations. These certifications are dependent upon our
    continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and
    sponsoring member banks. The member financial institutions, some
    of which are our competitors, set the standards with which we
    must comply. If we fail to comply with these standards we could
    be fined, our certifications could be suspended, or our
    registration could be terminated. The suspension or termination
    of our certifications, or any changes in the rules and
    regulations governing VISA, MasterCard, American Express,
    Discover, or other similar organizations could prevent our
    registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide services,
    which could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs
    of operation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect
    on our business.

Many
    of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to
    industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the
    number of transactions in which our customers engage and
    therefore reduces our revenues.

Our customers are subject to a number of government regulations
    and industry standards with which our services must comply. Our
    customers must ensure that our services and related products
    work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry
    requirements applicable to them. Federal, state, foreign or
    industry authorities could adopt laws, rules or regulations
    affecting our customers’ businesses which could lead to
    increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and
    functionality of our products and services possibly resulting in
    reduced market acceptance. In addition, action by regulatory
    authorities relating to credit availability, data usage,
    privacy, or other related regulatory developments could have an
    adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    and results of operations.

Security
    breaches or our own failure to comply with privacy regulations
    and industry security requirements imposed on providers of
    services to financial institutions and card processing services
    could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services
    and damaging our reputation.

As part of our business, we electronically receive, process,
    store and transmit sensitive business information of our
    customers. In addition, we collect personal consumer data, such
    as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver’s
    license numbers, cardholder data and payment history records.
    Unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could
    result in the theft or publication of confidential information,
    the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause
    interruptions in our operations. These risks are increased when
    we transmit information over the Internet.

Additionally, as a provider of services to financial
    institutions and card processing services, we are bound by the
    same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive
    from our customers as apply to the customers themselves. If we
    fail to comply with these regulations and industry security
    requirements, we could be exposed to suits for breach of
    contract, governmental proceedings, or prohibitions on card
    processing services. In addition, if more restrictive privacy
    laws, rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the
    future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry
    body, that could have an adverse impact on us through increased
    costs or restrictions



on business processes. Any inability to prevent security or
    privacy breaches could cause our existing customers to lose
    confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with
    us, and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers

and/or

adversely impact our relationship with administrative agencies.

Misappropriation
    of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair
    our competitive position.

Our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and
    technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
    rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our
    services or to obtain and use information that we regard as
    proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights
    is difficult. We cannot make any assurances that the steps we
    have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that
    the agreements entered into for that purpose will be
    enforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, and
    trade secret protection may not be available in every country in
    which our applications and services are made available online.
    Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential
    litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

If our
    applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary
    rights of others, we may be required to change our business
    practices and may also become subject to significant costs and
    monetary penalties.

As our information technology applications and services develop,
    we are increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any claims,
    whether with or without merit, could: (i) be expensive and
    time-consuming to defend; (ii) cause us to cease making,
    licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged
    intellectual property; (iii) require us to redesign our
    applications, if feasible; (iv) divert management’s
    attention and resources; and (v) require us to enter into
    royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to
    use necessary technologies.

We
    face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have
    guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s
    bank.

If a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check
    writer’s bank, we must reimburse our merchant customer for
    the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount
    from the check writer. In some cases, we recognize a liability
    to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a
    receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the
    check writers, based on historical experience and other relevant
    factors. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are
    subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our
    estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our
    estimates.

Lack
    of system integrity, fraudulent payments or credit quality
    related to funds settlement could result in a financial
    loss.

We settle funds on behalf of financial institutions, other
    businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients, card
    issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a
    variety of transaction types. Transactions facilitated by us
    include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment
    transactions, ACH payments and check clearing that supports
    consumers, financial institutions and other businesses. These
    payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that
    facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties,
    the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or
    prevention of fraudulent payments. If the continuity of
    operations, integrity of processing, or ability to detect or
    prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result
    in a financial loss to us. In addition, we may issue credit to
    consumers, financial institutions or other businesses as part of
    the funds settlement. A default on this credit by a counterparty
    could result in a financial loss to us.

Our
    business is subject to the risks of international operations,
    including movements in foreign currency exchange
    rates.

Our international operations represent 21% of total 2009
    revenues, with approximately 16% or our total revenues conducted
    in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. As a result, our
    financial condition and operating results could be significantly
    affected by risks associated with international activities,
    including economic and labor conditions, political instability,
    tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries),
    and changes in the value of



the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies. In addition, we
    are less well-known internationally than in the United States,
    have less experience with local business conditions and will
    face challenges in successfully managing small operations
    located far from our headquarters, because of the greater
    difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance.

As we expand our international operations, more of our customers
    may pay us in foreign currencies. Conducting business in
    currencies other than U.S. Dollars subjects us to
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to
    movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to foreign
    currencies in Brazil, Europe, Australia and parts of Asia. The
    U.S. Dollar value of our net investments in foreign
    operations, the periodic conversion of foreign-denominated
    earnings to the U.S. Dollar (our reporting currency), our
    results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, could be
    adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign
    currency exchange rates. During the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2009, approximately 16% of our revenues were
    denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar,
    including the Brazilian Real, British Pound and Euro. These
    risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial position and results of operations.

If we
    are unable to successfully consummate and integrate
    acquisitions, our results of operations may be adversely
    affected.

We have made numerous acquisitions in recent years as a part of
    our growth strategy. We anticipate that we will continue to seek
    to acquire complementary businesses and services. This strategy
    will depend on the ability to find suitable acquisitions and
    finance them on acceptable terms. We may require additional debt
    or equity financing for future acquisitions, and doing so may be
    made more difficult by our existing debt. If we are unable to
    acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience
    slower growth. Further, after successfully completing
    acquisitions, we face challenges in integrating acquired
    businesses. These challenges include eliminating redundant
    operations, facilities and systems, coordinating management and
    personnel, retaining key employees, managing different corporate
    cultures, and achieving cost reductions and cross-selling
    opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully
    or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them
    together, and the process of integrating these acquisitions may
    disrupt our business and divert our resources.

Failure
    to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior
    management personnel could harm our ability to
    grow.

Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and
    retain highly-skilled technical personnel. Because the
    development of our products and services requires knowledge of
    computer hardware, operating system software, system management
    software and application software, our technical personnel must
    be proficient in a number of disciplines. Competition for such
    technical personnel is intense, and our failure to hire and
    retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Our future growth will also require sales and marketing,
    financial and administrative personnel to develop and support
    new products and services, to enhance and support current
    products and services and to expand operational and financial
    systems. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our
    growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could
    adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a
    timely fashion.

Our senior management team has significant experience in the
    financial services industry, either at FIS or with clients or
    competitors, and the loss of this leadership could have an
    adverse effect on our business operating results and financial
    condition.

Risks
    Related to Business Combinations

We may
    fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other financial
    benefits of the Metavante merger on the anticipated schedule, if
    at all.

To achieve planned financial benefits of the Metavante merger,
    FIS will need to successfully integrate Metavante’s
    operations into its own in a timely and efficient manner and
    will need to execute transitional matters



successfully, including integrating new members of management
    and the retention of key personnel. There can be no assurance
    that FIS will be able to accomplish this integration process
    smoothly or successfully. In addition, the integration of
    certain operations following the merger will require the
    dedication of significant management resources, which will
    compete for management’s attention with its efforts to
    manage the

day-to-day

business of the combined company. Any inability to realize the
    full extent of, or any of, the anticipated cost savings and
    financial benefits of the merger, as well as any delays
    encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse
    effect on the business and results of operations of the combined
    company.

If any
    part of the LPS spin-off is determined to be a taxable
    transaction, then additional taxes could be imposed on us and
    our shareholders.

On June 20, 2008, we received a favorable private letter
    ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    regarding a series of transactions including the distribution of
    LPS common stock to our shareholders which we refer to as the
    spin-off.

Notwithstanding the favorable IRS ruling that the spin-off
    qualified for tax-free treatment, it would become taxable to us,
    pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code, if 50% or more of
    the shares of either our common stock or LPS common stock were
    acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of
    related transactions that included the spin-off. If the IRS were
    to determine that acquisitions of our common stock or of LPS
    common stock, either before or after the spin-off, were part of
    a plan or series of related transactions that included the
    spin-off, this determination could result in the recognition of
    substantial gain by us under Section 355(e).

Although the taxes resulting from the spin-off not qualifying
    for tax-free treatment pursuant to section 355(e) for
    United States Federal income tax purposes would be imposed on
    us, under the tax disaffiliation agreement entered into by us
    and LPS in connection with the spin-off, LPS would be required
    to indemnify us and our affiliates against all tax related
    liabilities caused by the failure of the spin-off to qualify for
    tax-free treatment for United States Federal income tax purposes
    as a result of Section 355(e) of the Code to the extent
    these liabilities arise as a result of any action taken by LPS
    or any of LPS’ affiliates following the spin-off or
    otherwise result from any breach of any representation, covenant
    or obligation of LPS or any of LPS’ affiliates under the
    tax disaffiliation agreement.

There is no guaranty that LPS will have financial resources to
    satisfy any such indemnification obligation described above.

The
    executive chairman of our board of directors and other officers
    and directors have interests and positions that could present
    potential conflicts.

We and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a variety of
    related party agreements and relationships with FNF and LPS.
    William P. Foley, II, who is our Executive Chairman, is
    currently the Executive Chairman of the board of directors of
    FNF. Lee A. Kennedy, who served as President and Chief Executive
    Officer of our company through September 30, 2009 and who
    currently serves as Executive Vice Chairman, is also the
    Executive Chairman of the board of directors of LPS. In
    addition, he serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Ceridian
    Corporation, a company in which FNF holds an approximate 33%
    equity interest. Brent B. Bickett and Michael L. Gravelle, who
    are executive officers of FIS, are also executive officers of
    FNF. William P. Foley, II, Brent B. Bickett and Michael L.
    Gravelle also own or hold substantial amounts of FNF stock and
    stock options. Thomas M. Hagerty and Richard N. Massey, who are
    both directors of FIS, are also directors of FNF. David K. Hunt,
    a director of FIS, is also a director of LPS. As a result of the
    foregoing, there may be circumstances where certain of our
    executive officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of
    interest with respect to, among other things: (i) our
    ongoing relationships with FNF and LPS, including related party
    agreements and other arrangements with respect to the
    administration of tax matters, employee benefits and
    indemnification; (ii) the quality, pricing and other terms
    associated with services that we provide to FNF and LPS, or that
    they provide to us, under related party agreements;
    (iii) business opportunities arising for either us, FNF or
    LPS, that could be pursued by either us, or by FNF or LPS; and
    (iv) conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially
    or actually involving or affecting FIS.

We seek to manage these potential conflicts through abstention,
    oversight by independent members of our board of directors and
    provisions in our agreements with FNF and LPS. However, there
    can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that
    we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts with FNF and
    LPS, or that the



resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us
    than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party.

We
    have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other
    intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions, and a
    severe or extended economic downturn could cause these
    investments to become impaired, requiring write-downs that would
    reduce our operating income.

As of December 31, 2009, goodwill aggregated to
    $8,232.9 million, 58.8% of total assets, and other
    indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to
    $49.1 million, 0.4% of total assets. Current accounting
    rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible
    assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or
    whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment.
    Factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include
    significant underperformance relative to historical or projected
    future operating results, a significant decline in our stock
    price and market capitalization, and negative industry or
    economic trends. The results of our fiscal year 2009 annual
    assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the
    fair values of the Company’s reporting units were in excess
    of the carrying values of those reporting units, and thus no
    goodwill impairment existed as of December 31, 2009.
    Additionally, other than impairment charges of
    $124.0 million relating to trademarks associated primarily
    with the rebranding of FIS, the fair value of indefinite lived
    intangible assets was in excess of the carrying value of those
    assets. However, if worldwide or United States economic
    conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank
    spending and consumer behavior, the carrying amount of our
    goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no
    longer be recoverable, and we may be required to record an
    impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our
    results of operations and financial condition. We will continue
    to monitor the fair value of our other indefinite lived
    intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the
    impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if
    there is an impairment in future periods.

Statement
    Regarding Forward-Looking Information

The statements contained in this

Form 10-K

or in our other documents or in oral presentations or other
    statements made by our management that are not purely historical
    are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    including statements regarding our expectations, hopes,
    intentions, or strategies regarding the future. These statements
    relate to, among other things, our future financial and
    operating results. In many cases, you can identify
    forward-looking statements by terminology such as
    “may,” “will,” “should,”
    “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,”
    “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative
    of these terms and other comparable terminology. Actual results
    could differ materially from those anticipated in these
    statements as a result of a number of factors, including, but
    not limited to:

•

general political, economic, and business conditions, including
    the possibility of intensified international hostilities, acts
    of terrorism, and general volatility in the capital markets;

•

failures to adapt our services to changes in technology or in
    the marketplace;

•

consolidation or failures in the banking industry;

•

consolidation or failures in the retail industry;

•

security breaches of our systems and computer viruses affecting
    our software;

•

the impact of competitive services and pricing;

•

the failure to achieve some or all of the benefits that we
    expect from the acquisition of Metavante, including the
    possibility that our acquisition of Metavante may not be
    accretive to our earnings due to undisclosed liabilities,
    management or integration issues, loss of customers, the
    inability to achieve targeted cost savings, or other factors;

•

the ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates and the
    ability to finance such acquisitions, which depends upon the
    availability of adequate cash reserves from operations or of
    acceptable financing terms and the variability of our stock
    price;



•

our ability to integrate any acquired business’ operations,
    services, clients, and personnel;

•

the effect of our substantial leverage, which may limit the
    funds available to make acquisitions and invest in our business;

•

changes in, or the failure to comply with, government
    regulations, including privacy regulations; and

•

other risks detailed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and
    in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We are not under any obligation (and expressly disclaim any such
    obligation) to update or alter our forward-looking statements,
    whether as a result of new information, future events or
    otherwise. You should carefully consider the possibility that
    actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking
    statements.

Properties.

FIS’ corporate headquarters is located at 601 Riverside
    Avenue, Jacksonville, Florida in a facility leased from LPS. In
    addition, FIS owns or leases support centers, data processing
    facilities and other facilities at over 210 locations. We
    believe our facilities and equipment are generally well
    maintained and are in good operating condition. We believe that
    the computer equipment that we own and our various facilities
    are adequate for our present and foreseeable business needs. We
    maintain our own, and contract with multiple service providers
    to provide, processing

back-up

in

PART II

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the
    ticker symbol “FIS.” The table set forth below
    provides the high and low sales prices of the common stock and
    the cash dividends declared per share of common stock for each
    quarter of 2009 and 2008.

On October 1, 2009, FIS completed the acquisition of
    Metavante. As a result of the merger, each outstanding share of
    Metavante common stock was converted into 1.35 shares (the
    “Exchange Ratio”) or approximately 163.6 million
    shares of FIS common stock. In addition, outstanding Metavante
    stock options and other stock-based awards (other than
    performance shares) converted into stock options and other
    stock-based awards with respect to shares of FIS common stock,
    with adjustments in the number of shares and exercise price (in
    the case of stock options) to reflect the Exchange Ratio. Each
    outstanding Metavante performance share was assumed by FIS and
    converted into the right to receive restricted shares of FIS
    common stock (with adjustments to reflect the Exchange Ratio)
    and an amount in cash.

On July 2, 2008 (the “spin-off date”), all of the
    shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of LPS,
    previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIS, were distributed to
    FIS shareholders through a stock dividend (the
    “spin-off”). In the spin-off, FIS contributed to LPS
    all of FIS’ interest in the assets, liabilities, businesses
    and employees related to FIS’ Lender Processing Services
    segment in exchange for shares of LPS common stock and



$1,585.0 million aggregate principal amount of LPS debt
    obligations, which we exchanged with the holders of our $1,585.0
    Term Loan B and retired the latter debt. Upon the distribution,
    FIS shareholders received one-half share of LPS common stock for
    every share of FIS common stock held as of the close of business
    on June 24, 2008. FIS’ shareholders collectively
    received 100% of the LPS common stock and LPS became a separate
    public company trading under the symbol “LPS” on the
    New York Stock Exchange.

(a)

The sales prices of our common stock for the third and fourth
    quarter of 2008 reflect the LPS spin-off. As of January 31,
    2010, there were approximately 19,968 shareholders of
    record of our common stock.

We currently pay a $0.05 dividend on a quarterly basis, and
    expect to continue to do so in the future. The declaration and
    payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of
    Directors, and depends on, among other things, our investment
    policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial
    condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other
    factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of
    Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions.
    Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by
    covenants in our debt agreements. A regular quarterly dividend
    of $0.05 per common share is payable March 30, 2010 to
    shareholders of record as of the close of business on
    March 16, 2010.

Item 12 of Part III contains information concerning
    securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation
    plans.

On October 25, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a plan
    authorizing repurchases of up to $200.0 million worth of
    our common stock (the “Old Plan”). On April 17,
    2008, our Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing
    repurchases of up to an additional $250.0 million worth of
    our common stock (the “New Plan”). Under the New Plan
    we repurchased 5.8 million shares of our common stock for
    $226.2 million, at an average price of $38.97, during the
    year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we also repurchased an additional
    0.2 million shares of our common stock for
    $10.0 million at an average price of $40.56 under the Old
    Plan. Total shares repurchased during the year ended
    December 31, 2008 were 6.0 million shares for
    $236.2 million at an average price of $39.04. There were no
    share repurchases under these plans during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 prior to the plan expiration.

On February 4, 2010 our Board of Directors approved a plan
    authorizing repurchases of up to 15.0 million shares of our
    common stock in the open market, at prevailing market prices or
    in privately negotiated transactions through January 31,
    2013.



Item 6.

Selected
    Financial Data.

The selected financial data set forth below constitutes
    historical financial data of FIS and should be read in
    conjunction with Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and
    Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,
    included elsewhere in this report.

On October 1, 2009, we completed the acquisition of
    Metavante. The results of operations and financial position of
    Metavante are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
    since the date of acquisition.

On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS spin-off. For
    accounting purposes the results of LPS are presented as
    discontinued operations. Accordingly all prior periods have been
    restated to present the results of FIS on a stand alone basis
    and include the results of LPS up to July 1, 2008 as
    discontinued operations.

On September 12, 2007, we completed the acquisition of
    eFunds (the “eFunds Acquisition”). The results of
    operations and financial position of eFunds are included in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition.

On February 1, 2006, we completed the Certegy Merger. For
    accounting and financial reporting purposes, the merger was
    treated as a reverse acquisition of Certegy by FIS under the
    purchase method of accounting pursuant to generally accepted
    accounting principles. Accordingly, our historical financial
    information for periods prior to the Certegy Merger is the
    historical financial information of FIS.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following section discusses management’s view of the
    financial condition and results of operations of FIS and its
    consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008
    and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

This section should be read in conjunction with the audited
    Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes of FIS
    included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations contains forward-looking statements. See
    “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk
    Factors” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and
    assumptions associated with these forward-looking statements
    that could cause future results to differ materially from those
    reflected in this section.

Overview

FIS is a leading global provider of banking and payments
    technology solutions, processing services and information-based
    services. We offer financial institution core processing, card
    issuer and transaction processing services, including the NYCE
    Network. FIS is a member of Standard and Poor’s (S&P)

®

Index and consistently holds a leading ranking in the annual
    FinTech 100 rankings. As of December 31, 2009, FIS has more
    than 300 solutions serving over 14,000 financial institutions
    and business customers in over 100 countries spanning all
    segments of the financial services industry. We have four
    reporting segments: FSG, PSG, ISG and Corporate and



Other. A description of these segments is included above in
    Item 1. Revenues by segment and the results of operations
    of our segments are discussed below in Segment Results of
    Operations.

Business
    Trends and Conditions

Approximately 85% of our revenue is derived from multiyear
    agreements and is considered recurring, which provides relative
    stability to our revenue stream. However, the condition of the
    overall economy can affect our revenue growth in a number of
    areas. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from
    transaction processing fees. As a result, lower deposit and card
    transactions associated with reduced consumer and commercial
    activity will adversely impact revenue. In addition, sales of
    software licenses and professional services, which represent
    approximately 15% of our revenue, can be regarded as
    discretionary spending by our customers and may contract when
    their capital budgets tighten. In light of the challenging
    revenue environment, we are seeking to manage our costs and
    capital expenditures prudently. Before consideration of the
    Metavante acquisition, we reduced both domestic headcount and
    capital expenditures in 2009 from 2008 levels.

We completed the Metavante merger on October 1, 2009. The
    combined Company is positioned to provide a comprehensive range
    of integrated solutions to its customers, and has greater
    geographic reach than any other provider in the industry, which
    will enhance service to the combined company’s customers.
    Management expects to realize cost and revenue synergies over
    the next twenty-four months.

As the payment market continues to evolve from paper-based to
    electronic, we continue to add new services responsive to this
    trend. Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of
    total

point-of-sale

payments, which fuels continuing demand for card-related
    services. In recent years, we have added a variety of
    stored-value card types, Internet banking, and electronic bill
    presentment/payment services, as well as a number of card
    enhancement and loyalty/reward programs. The common goal of
    these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the
    consumer coupled with value to the financial institution. The
    evolution to electronic transactions also intensifies the
    vulnerability to fraud, increasing the demand for our risk
    management solutions. At the same time, the use of checks
    continues to decline as a percentage of total

point-of-sale

payments, which negatively impacts our check warranty and
    item-processing businesses.

We compete for both licensing and outsourcing business, and thus
    are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to
    utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to
    process in-house under a software license and maintenance
    agreement. As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit
    from multi-year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate
    the effects of year to year economic changes on our results of
    operations. One of the current trends we expect to benefit from
    in the financial services industry is the migration to an
    outsourced model to improve profitability.

Consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or
    detrimental to our businesses. When consolidations occur, merger
    partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing
    service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a
    determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a
    single platform. When a financial institution processing client
    is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the
    use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the
    consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely,
    we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a
    consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the
    consolidation and support the newly combined entity. We seek to
    mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other
    competitive services, to take advantage of specific
    opportunities at the surviving company.

We believe that we are in the midst of one of the most difficult
    times that has ever existed for financial institutions,
    retailers and other businesses in the United States and
    internationally. We expect a continuation of bank failures in
    the next few years, which may be offset to a degree by somewhat
    decreased bank acquisition activity, which traditionally occurs
    in the banking sector. To date bank failures and forced
    government actions that have occurred have not been significant
    to our revenues, however, continuing or escalating bank failures
    and forced government actions could negatively impact our
    business. This exposure may be mitigated by incremental revenues
    we may generate from license fees or services associated with
    assisting surviving institutions with integrating acquired
    assets resulting from financial failures.



While we believe that we are well positioned to withstand the
    current financial crisis, there are factors outside our control
    that might impact our operating results that we may not be able
    to fully anticipate as to timing and severity, including but not
    limited to adverse effects if banks are nationalized, or if
    global economic conditions worsen, causing further slowdowns in
    consumer spending and lending. Further, there could be an impact
    on our ability to access capital should any of our lenders fail.

For an update on our Brazil card processing venture, see
    Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The accounting policies described below are those we consider
    critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.
    These policies require management to make estimates, judgments
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent
    liabilities and assets at the date of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from
    those estimates. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a more detailed description of the
    significant accounting policies that have been followed in
    preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank
    processing, credit and debit card processing services, other
    payment processing services, professional services, software
    licensing and software related services and products. Revenues
    are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
    has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable and collection is
    considered probable. We are frequently a party to multiple
    concurrent contracts with the same customer. These situations
    require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts
    should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of
    revenue recognition. In making this determination, we consider
    the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether
    the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and
    whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are
    interrelated. Due to the large number, broad nature and average
    size of individual contracts we are party to, the impact of
    judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue
    for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect
    on our consolidated operations or financial position. However
    the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across
    similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly
    influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our
    historical and future results of operations or financial
    position. Additional information about our revenue recognition
    policies is included in Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The Company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering
    historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current
    economic trends, changes in customer payment terms and
    collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used may
    result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being
    recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The
    allowance for doubtful accounts was $41.8 million and
    $40.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Reserves
    for Check Guarantee Losses

In our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented
    to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s
    bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s
    face value and pursue collection of the amount from the
    delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and anticipated
    recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical
    analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and
    considering other factors that could affect that experience in
    the future. Such factors include the general economy, the
    overall industry mix of our customer volumes, statistical
    analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and
    the quality of returned checks. Once these factors are
    considered, we establish a rate for check losses that is
    calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar
    volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is
    calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total
    amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied
    against the dollar volume processed and check losses,
    respectively, each month and charged to costs of revenues. The
    estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk
    that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than
    our estimates.



Historically, such estimation processes have proven to be
    materially accurate; however, our projections of probable check
    guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently
    uncertain, and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the
    amount of such items. Changes in economic conditions, the risk
    characteristics and composition of our customers, and other
    factors could impact our actual and projected amounts. We
    recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries
    excluding service fees, of $83.3 million and
    $115.2 million, respectively, for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. A ten percent difference in our
    estimated check guarantee loss reserve net of estimated
    recoveries as of December 31, 2009 could impact
    2009 net earnings by less than $2.0 million after-tax.

Computer
    Software

Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired
    in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized
    software development costs. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, computer software, net of accumulated amortization, was
    $932.7 million and $617.0 million, respectively.
    Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the
    straight line method over its estimated useful life and software
    acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value
    and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over
    its estimated useful life, ranging from 3 to 10 years. In
    determining useful lives, management considers historical
    results and technological trends which may influence the
    estimate. Amortization expense for computer software was
    $149.8 million, $149.9 million and $164.3 million
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in discontinued
    operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was
    amortization expense on computer software of $14.8 million
    and $32.5 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also
    assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on
    a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated
    future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software
    asset. There are inherent uncertainties in determining the
    expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer
    software. While we have not historically experienced significant
    changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes
    in the future.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired
    businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
    transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used
    to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as
    intangible assets, are complex and require a significant amount
    of management judgment. We generally engage independent
    valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value
    determinations. We are also required to estimate the useful
    lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of
    acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to
    record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated
    useful lives assigned to our definite-lived intangible assets to
    determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be
    appropriate. Additionally we review our indefinite lived
    intangible assets to determine if there is any change in
    circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is
    no longer indefinite.

We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. The authoritative guidance requires us to perform a
    two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair
    value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine
    the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value
    of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting
    unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets,
    goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If
    the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets
    exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second
    step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value
    of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge.
    Additionally, we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible
    assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the
    underlying carrying value.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired
    intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and
    the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include
    assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating
    margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows,
    risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market
    conditions and other assumptions.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, our analysis of
    indefinite lived intangible assets did indicate an impairment of
    certain trademarks which are being discontinued as a result of
    the Company’s rebranding campaign



initiated on October 1, 2009 following the acquisition of
    Metavante. Accordingly we recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $124.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. During the
    year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a pre-tax
    impairment charge of $52.0 million to reduce the carrying
    value of a trademark related to our retail check business to its
    estimated fair value and included approximately
    $26.0 million of this charge in discontinued operations.
    Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset
    balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an
    impairment charge, which could be material to our financial
    statements.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of
    the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves
    estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing
    temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of
    items for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences
    result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are
    included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then
    assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be
    recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we
    believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation
    allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or
    increase this allowance in a period, we must reflect this
    increase as an expense within income tax expense in the
    Statement of Earnings. Determination of the income tax expense
    requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may
    require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the
    geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual
    pre-tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate
    to vary from period to period. We believe that our tax positions
    comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide
    for any known tax contingencies. We believe the estimates and
    assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit
    realization are reasonable. However, final determination of
    prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax
    authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be
    materially different than estimates reflected in assets and
    liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of
    these final determinations could have a material effect on our
    income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period
    that determination is made.

Related
    Party Transactions

We are a party to certain historical related party agreements
    with FNF, LPS and other related parties (see Note 5 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    Part II of this Report).

Factors
    Affecting Comparability

Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report
    that present our financial condition and operating results
    reflect the following significant transactions:

•

On October 1, 2009, we acquired Metavante in a tax-free
    reorganization. Each outstanding share of Metavante common stock
    was converted into 1.35 shares, or approximately
    163.6 million total shares, of FIS common stock.
    Outstanding Metavante stock options and other stock-based awards
    were converted into FIS stock options and stock-based awards
    using the same exchange ratio. The results of operations and
    financial position of Metavante are included in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements from and after the date of acquisition.

•

On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS
    spin-off.  The results of operations of the Lender
    Processing Services segment through the July 2, 2008
    spin-off date are reflected as discontinued operations in the
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented.

•

On September 12, 2007, we acquired
    eFunds.  eFunds provided risk management, EFT
    services, prepaid/gift card processing, and global outsourcing
    solutions to financial services companies in the U.S. and
    internationally. In connection with this acquisition, we
    borrowed an additional $1.6 billion under our bank credit
    facilities. The results of operations and financial position of
    eFunds are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
    from and after the date of acquisition.

•

On August 31, 2007, we completed the sale of one of our
    subsidiaries, Property Insight, to FNF, for $95.0 million
    in cash, realizing a pre-tax gain of $66.9 million
    ($42.1 million after-tax) which is reported as a



discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of
    earnings. Property Insight was a leading provider of title plant
    services to FNF, as well as to various national and regional
    title insurance underwriters. Property Insight primarily
    managed, maintained, and updated the title insurance plants that
    are owned by FNF.

•

On July 3, 2007, we sold our 29% interest in Covansys to
    Computer Sciences Corporation (“CSC”) by exchanging
    our remaining 6.9 million shares of stock and
    4.0 million warrants in Covansys for cash. We realized a
    pre-tax gain on sales of Covansys securities of
    $274.5 million in 2007.

As a result of the above transactions, the results of operations
    in the periods covered by the Consolidated Financial Statements
    may not be directly comparable.

Processing
    and Services Revenues

Processing and services revenues totaled $3,769.5 million,
    $3,427.7 million and $2,892.9 million in 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. The increase in revenue during 2009 of
    $341.8 million, or 10.0% as compared to 2008 is primarily
    attributable to the impact of the Metavante acquisition, which
    contributed fourth quarter revenues of $404.1 million,
    partially offset by $53.7 million in unfavorable foreign
    currency impact resulting from a strengthening of the
    U.S. Dollar and other items referred to in the segment
    discussion below. The increase in revenue during 2008 of
    $534.8 million, or 18.5% as compared to 2007 is primarily
    attributable to the impact of the eFunds acquisition, which
    contributed year over year incremental revenues of
    $396.3 million. Additionally our Brazilian card processing
    venture, the (“Brazilian Venture”) had a year over
    year increase in revenue of $87.7 million for 2008.

Cost
    of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of revenues totaled $2,800.6 million,
    $2,689.3 million and $2,315.3 million in 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, resulting in gross profit of
    $968.9 million, $738.4 million and $577.6 million
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Gross profit as a
    percentage of revenues (“gross margin”) was 25.7%,
    21.5% and 20.0% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    increase in cost of revenues of $111.3 million in the 2009
    period as compared to the 2008 period is directly attributable
    to the revenue variances addressed above. The increase in gross
    margin of 420 basis points for 2009 over 2008 was driven by
    the Company’s continued effort to reduce costs and improve
    operating efficiency, coupled with the initial results from the
    synergy initiatives associated with the Metavante merger. The
    increase in cost of revenues of $374.0 million in the 2008
    period as compared to the 2007 period is directly attributable
    to revenue growth across our three operating segments. The
    increase in gross margin of 150 basis points for 2008 over
    2007 was driven by the growth of higher margin sales and gained
    efficiencies relating to the integration of eFunds.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled
    $554.1 million, $388.6 million and $302.5 million
    for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase of
    $165.5 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily
    due to: (a) restructuring, integration and merger related
    charges, including professional and advisory fees, severance,
    incentive bonuses and lease adjustments contributing
    $108.5 million of the

year-over-year

increase and (b) incremental costs associated with the
    Metavante acquisition. Stock-based compensation increased from
    $51.6 million in 2008 to $71.0 million in 2009.
    Stock-based compensation in the 2009 period included vesting
    acceleration charges of $29.2 million due to change in
    control provisions triggered by the Metavante acquisition and
    $4.5 million for new merger related grants. By comparison,
    the 2008 period included charges of $14.1 million for the
    accelerated vesting of all stock awards held by eFunds employees
    assumed in the eFunds acquisition and $2.6 million relating
    to the acceleration, upon termination, of certain unvested
    executive stock awards. The increase of $86.1 million in
    2008 as



compared to 2007 primarily relates to the incremental costs from
    the eFunds acquisition, as well as increased stock compensation
    costs, additional restructuring and integration charges, and
    charges associated with the LPS spin-off. Stock-based
    compensation increased from $24.9 million in 2007 to
    $51.6 million in 2008. The $26.7 million increase in
    stock-based compensation is mainly attributable to the 2008
    acceleration charges noted above. The remaining increase is
    attributable to $21.0 million of additional restructuring
    and integration charges and $9.3 million in charges
    associated with the spin-off of LPS as compared to
    $6.0 million and $0.5 million of such charges,
    respectively in 2007.

Impairment
    Charges

Impairment charges totaled $136.9 million,
    $26.0 million and $13.5 million for 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The 2009 charges relate primarily to the
    introduction of a new brand identity in conjunction with the
    Metavante merger, giving rise to the impairment of a number of
    previously acquired trademarks. The 2009 period also included
    charges related to impairment of certain capitalized software
    assets totaling approximately $12.9 million. The 2008
    period included charges of $26.0 million to reduce the
    carrying value of a trademark related to our retail check
    business to its estimated fair value. The 2007 period included
    impairment charges of $13.5 million to write-off impaired
    software assets.

Operating
    Income

Operating income totaled $277.9 million,
    $323.8 million and $261.6 million for 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue
    (“operating margin”) was 7.4%, 9.4% and 9.0% for 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in operating margin
    for 2009 as compared to the 2008 and 2007 periods is primarily
    attributable to the impairment charges noted above and increased
    restructuring, integration and merger related charges relating
    to the Metavante acquisition.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense totaled $134.0 million,
    $163.5 million and $190.2 million for 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The decrease of $29.5 million in
    interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 results from:
    (a) lower interest rates on our debt; (b) a
    $9.3 million make-whole premium in 2008 on the redemption
    of the eFunds Notes; and (c) the $12.4 million
    write-off of debt issuance costs in 2008 associated with the
    Term Loan B retired in conjunction with the LPS spin-off. The
    decrease of $26.7 million in interest expense in 2008 as
    compared to 2007 is the result of a reduction of
    $1.6 billion in debt associated with the LPS spin-off on
    July 2, 2008 and the inclusion of $27.2 million in
    write-offs of capitalized debt issuance costs relating to our
    prior credit facility during 2007, partially offset by the 2008
    write-off of debt issuance costs noted in (c) above.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

Income tax expense from continuing operations totaled
    $52.1 million, $53.3 million and $128.4 million
    for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This resulted in an
    effective tax rate on continuing operations of 33.4%, 31.7% and
    35.3% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The net change in
    the 2009 period overall effective tax rate is primarily related
    to the impact of the LPS spin-off in the 2008 period. The
    decrease in tax expense for the 2008 period as compared to the
    2007 period is attributable to the 2007 gain on sale of Covansys
    common stock and warrants, partially offset by increased
    operating income in the 2008 period. The decrease in the 2008
    overall effective tax rate is primarily related to state tax
    benefits and benefits related to research and development
    credits. Additionally, our overall effective tax rate is lower
    than the effective statutory rates driven in part by the impact
    of our international operations.

Net
    Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to FIS Common
    Stockholders

Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to FIS
    common stockholders totaled $101.3 million,
    $110.5 million and $237.2 million for 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively, or $0.42, $0.57 and $1.21 per diluted share,
    respectively, due to the factors described above.

Revenues for FSG totaled $1,260.0 million,
    $1,135.8 million and $979.6 million for 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The overall segment increase of
    $124.2 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 resulted
    primarily from incremental fourth quarter Metavante revenues of
    $154.2 million, partially offset by lower software license
    and professional services revenue. The overall segment increase
    of $156.2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 resulted
    primarily from the impact of the eFunds acquisition that
    occurred on September 12, 2007 and organic growth within
    our existing business. Incremental revenue from the eFunds
    acquisition contributed a year over year increase of
    $143.3 million.

Operating income for FSG totaled $417.7 million,
    $352.2 million and $182.1 million for 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 33.2%,
    31.0% and 18.6% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily resulted from the
    fourth quarter impact of the Metavante acquisition and increased
    operating margins due to current year targeted cost reductions.
    The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily resulted from
    increased operating margins due to targeted cost reductions
    coupled with the relatively higher margin on the additional
    revenues from the eFunds acquisition.

    and 2007, respectively. The overall segment increase of
    $215.6 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 resulted
    primarily from incremental fourth quarter Metavante revenues of
    $258.1 million, partially offset by reduced termination
    fees and lower item processing, prepaid card and retail check
    activity. The overall segment increase of $223.1 million in
    2008 as compared to 2007 resulted primarily from the impact of
    the eFunds acquisition, which contributed year over year
    incremental revenue of $210.5 million.

Revenues for ISG totaled $782.7 million,
    $768.1 million and $613.7 million for 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The overall segment increase of
    $14.6 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily
    resulted from an increase in core processing revenue driven by
    strong services revenue and volumes in the Asia Pacific and EMEA
    regions and payments revenue driven by organic growth across all
    regions and nominal incremental revenues from Metavante,
    partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of
    $53.7 million. The overall segment increase of
    $154.4 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily
    resulted from increased revenue in our Brazilian Venture and
    incremental revenues due to the eFunds acquisition, partially
    offset by unfavorable currency effects of $28.2 million.
    The Brazilian Venture had a 2008 year over year increase in
    revenues of $87.7 million and the eFunds acquisition
    contributed year over year incremental revenue of
    $41.5 million.

Operating income for ISG totaled $114.2 million,
    $68.7 million and $57.3 million for 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Operating margin was 14.6%, 8.9% and 9.3%
    for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in operating
    income and margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily results
    from improved scale and efficiencies within operations.

Corporate
    and Other

The Corporate and Other segment results consist of selling,
    general and administrative expenses and depreciation and
    intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the
    reportable segments. Corporate and Other expenses were
    $729.6 million, $450.9 million and $269.6 million
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The overall Corporate and
    Other increase of $278.7 million for 2009 as compared to
    2008 is primarily due to the restructuring, integration and
    merger related charges, impairment charges to trademarks and
    certain capitalized software assets and incremental costs
    associated with the Metavante acquisition as addressed above
    under total Company

Selling, General and Administrative

. The overall

    integration charges and costs associated with the LPS spin-off.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash
    Requirements

Our cash requirements include cost of revenues, selling, general
    and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service
    payments, capital expenditures, systems development
    expenditures, stockholder dividends, and business acquisitions.
    Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations
    and borrowings.

At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of
    $430.9 million and debt of $3,253.3 million, including
    the current portion. Of the $430.9 million cash and cash
    equivalents, approximately $195.4 million is held by our
    operations in foreign jurisdictions. We expect that cash flows
    from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient
    to fund our operating cash requirements and pay principal and
    interest on our outstanding debt.

We currently pay a $0.05 per common share dividend on a
    quarterly basis, and expect to continue to do so in the future.
    The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the
    discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other
    things, our investment policy and opportunities, results of
    operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future
    prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by
    our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual
    restrictions. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be
    limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular
    quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share is payable
    March 30, 2010 to shareholders of record as of the close of
    business on March 16, 2010.

Cash
    Flows from Operations

Cash flows from operations were $714.1 million,
    $596.4 million and $463.5 million in 2009, 2008 and
    2007 respectively. Cash flows from operations in 2008 include
    cash flows from LPS of $136.7 million. Excluding the 2008
    impact of LPS, cash flows from operations increased by
    $254.4 million due to higher earnings before



consideration of the impairment charges, better working capital
    management during the 2009 period and the collection of
    $73.5 million of receivables retained after the sale of
    Certegy Australia Ltd. Cash flows from operations for 2007 were
    reduced by tax liability payments of $106.6 million
    relating to the gain on sale of our investment in Covansys and a
    $47.5 million reduction in taxes payable due to stock
    option exercises.

Capital
    Expenditures

Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software
    (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property
    and equipment. We spent approximately $212.5 million,
    $255.4 million and $343.3 million on capital
    expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007 respectively, including approximately
    $25.4 million during the 2008 period related to
    discontinued operations including LPS prior to the spin-off. We
    expect to spend approximately 5%-6% of 2010 revenue on capital
    expenditures.

Financing

On January 18, 2007, we entered into a five-year syndicated
    unsecured credit agreement (the “FIS Credit
    Agreement”). The FIS Credit Agreement provides total
    committed capital of $3,000.0 million comprised of
    $2,100.0 million of term notes (the “Term Loan
    A”) and $900.0 million of revolving capacity (the
    “Revolving Loan”). The Revolving Loan is bifurcated
    into two tranches; a $165.0 million tranche that allows
    borrowings in U.S. Dollars only and a $735.0 million
    multicurrency tranche that allows borrowings in
    U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling, and
    Australian Dollars. The multicurrency tranche of the Revolving
    Loan includes a sublimit of $250.0 million for swing line
    loans and a $250.0 million sublimit for the issuance of
    letters of credit. In addition, the FIS Credit Agreement
    originally provided for an uncommitted incremental loan facility
    in the maximum principal amount of $600.0 million.

To facilitate our acquisition of eFunds, on July 30, 2007,
    we executed an amendment to the FIS Credit Agreement to increase
    the permitted maximum principal of uncommitted incremental loans
    from $600.0 million to $2,100.0 million and converted
    the facility from unsecured to secured. On September 12,
    2007, the amendment became effective, and we entered into a
    joinder agreement to obtain $1,600.0 million of term loans
    (the “Term Loan B”). On July 2, 2008, in
    conjunction with the spin-off of Lender Processing Services,
    Inc., $1,585.0 million, the then outstanding principal
    balance of Term Loan B was retired.

On November 1, 2007, Metavante entered into a credit
    agreement (the “MV Credit Agreement”) for an aggregate
    principal amount of $2,000.0 million comprised of
    $1,750.0 million of seven-year term loans (the “MV
    Term Loan”) and a six-year revolving capacity of
    $250.0 million (the “MV Revolving Loan”).
    Immediately preceding the merger of FIS and Metavante, the
    outstanding balances of the MV Term Loan and MV Revolving Loan
    were $1,723.8 million and $0, respectively.

On October 1, 2009, contemporaneous with the closing of the
    Metavante merger, FIS obtained $500.0 million of term loans
    (the “Term Loan C”), utilizing the $500.0 million
    of remaining uncommitted incremental loans under the
    September 12, 2007 amendment of the FIS Credit Agreement.
    FIS exchanged the $500.0 million of Term Loan C for
    $500.0 million of the MV Term Loan (which portion was
    subsequently cancelled). In addition, on October 1, 2009,
    FIS purchased $423.8 million of the remaining MV Term Loan,
    which loans were deemed to be contemporaneously cancelled. After
    giving effect to the exchange, purchase and cancellation, the
    aggregate principal amount of the MV Term Loan outstanding as of
    October 1, 2009 was $800.0 million.

Also on October 1, 2009, FIS entered into an agreement to
    sell certain of its accounts receivable (the “AR
    Facility”) to a

wholly-owned

special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the
    “SPV”), which is exclusively engaged in purchasing
    receivables from FIS. The SPV funds its purchases, in part, by
    selling interests in the accounts receivables to a syndicate of
    financial institution purchasers in exchange for up to
    $145.0 million in capital funding (provided, however, that
    if FIS obtains additional commitments from new or existing
    purchasers, the aggregate amount may be increased by up to an
    additional $55.0 million, to an overall aggregate capital
    amount of $200.0 million). The sales to the purchasers do
    not qualify for sale treatment as we maintain effective control
    over the receivables that are sold. Thus, the SPV is included in
    our consolidated financial statements. At December 31,
    2009, there was no outstanding capital under the accounts
    receivable facility.



We may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the Revolving
    Loan from time to time until the maturity of the Revolving Loan.
    We must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A
    of $52.5 million per quarter from March 31, 2010
    through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance of
    $1.522.5 million payable on January 18, 2012. As of
    December 31, 2009, there are no longer any mandatory
    quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan C as these
    requirements have been fulfilled in full due to principal
    prepayments made during the quarter ended December 31,
    2009. The remaining principal balance of the Term Loan C is
    payable on January 18, 2012. We must make quarterly
    principal payments on the MV Term Loan in the amount of
    $2.0 million on the first business day of each February,
    May, August, and November with the balance of
    $759.4 million payable on November 1, 2014.

    payments on the FIS Credit Agreement and MV Credit Agreement as

The FIS Credit Agreement, MV Credit Agreement, and AR Facility
    are subject to customary affirmative, negative and financial
    covenants, including, among other things, limits on the creation
    of liens, limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions
    on investments and dispositions, limitations on dividends and
    other restricted payments, a minimum interest coverage ratio and
    a maximum leverage ratio. We were in compliance with all
    covenants related to the credit facilities at December 31,
    2009.

As of December 31, 2009, one financial institution that was
    a lender under one of our credit facilities had failed, thereby
    reducing the amount of revolving capacity available to us under
    our Revolving Loan by an immaterial amount. No other financial
    institutions that are lenders under any of our credit facilities
    have failed to date. We continue to monitor the financial
    stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. The lender
    commitments under the undrawn portions of the Revolving Loan and
    AR Facility are comprised of a diversified set of financial
    institutions both domestic and international. The combined
    commitments of our top 10 lenders comprise about 67% of our
    Revolving Loan and AR Facility. The failure of any single lender
    to perform their obligations under the Revolving Loan

and/or

the
    AR Facility would not adversely impact our ability to fund
    operations. If the single largest lender were to simultaneously
    default under the terms of both the FIS Credit Agreement
    (impacting the capacity of the Revolving Loan) and the AR
    Facility, the maximum loss of available capacity on the undrawn
    portion of these agreements would be about $117.6 million.
    As of December 31, 2009, the combined undrawn capacity of
    the Revolving Loan and the AR Facility was $703.4 million.

As of December 31, 2009, we have entered into interest rate
    swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate
    exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed
    (see Item 7A).

Private
    Placement Investment

On October 1, 2009, pursuant to an investment agreement
    with Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (“THL”) and FNF
    dated as of March 31, 2009, FIS issued and sold (a) to
    THL in a private placement 12.9 million shares of FIS
    common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
    $200.0 million and (b) to FNF in a private placement
    3.2 million shares of FIS common stock for an aggregate
    purchase price of approximately $50.0 million. FIS paid
    each of THL and FNF a transaction fee equal to 3% of their
    respective investments. The investment agreement provides that
    neither THL nor FNF may transfer the shares purchased in the
    investments, subject to limited exceptions, for 180 days
    after the closing.



Contractual
    Obligations

FIS’ long-term contractual obligations generally include
    its long-term debt and operating lease payments on certain of
    its property and equipment. The following table summarizes

FIS believes that its existing cash balances, cash flows from
    operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources
    of liquidity and capital resources to meet FIS’ expected
    short-term liquidity needs and its long-term needs for the
    operations of its business, expected capital spending for the
    next 12 months and the foreseeable future and the
    satisfaction of these obligations and commitments.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

FIS does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued new guidance requiring an acquirer in a business
    combination to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities
    assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at
    their fair values at the acquisition date, with limited
    exceptions. The costs of the acquisition and any related
    restructuring costs are to be recognized separately. When the
    fair value of assets acquired exceeds the fair value of
    consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in
    the acquiree, the excess will be recognized as a gain. All
    business combinations will be accounted for prospectively by
    applying the acquisition method, including combinations among
    mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. In April
    2009, the FASB amended and clarified the initial recognition and
    measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and related
    disclosures arising from contingencies in a business
    combination. Assets and liabilities arising from contingencies
    in a business combination are to be recognized at their fair
    value on the acquisition date if fair value can be determined
    during the measurement period. If fair value cannot be
    determined, the existing guidance for contingencies and other
    authoritative literature should be followed. This new guidance
    is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15,
    2008, and applies to business combinations occurring after the
    effective date. The Company has applied the provisions to the
    Metavante combination, and will apply the provisions
    prospectively for any future business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance relative to
    noncontrolling interests (sometimes called minority interests),
    requiring: (1) that noncontrolling interests be presented
    as a component of equity on the balance sheet; (2) that the
    amount of net earnings attributable to the parent and to the
    noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented on
    the face of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings; and
    (3) expanded disclosures that identify and distinguish
    between the interests of the parent’s owners and the
    interests of the non-controlling owners of subsidiaries. The
    Company adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements as
    of January 1, 2009, with retrospective application for all
    periods presented.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance for transfers and
    servicing of financial assets. The primary changes include:
    (1) the elimination of the “qualified special purpose
    entity” concept, and the exception that allowed many
    transferors to deconsolidate such entities; (2) a new
    “participating interest” definition that must be met
    for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for
    sale accounting; (3) clarification and amendments



to the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for
    as a sale; (4) a change to the amount of recognized
    gain/loss on a transfer accounted for as a sale when beneficial
    interests are received by the transferor; and (5) enhanced
    disclosure requirements. This new guidance will be applied
    prospectively to new transfers of financial assets occurring in
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new consolidation guidance for
    variable interest entities (VIE’s). It requires an
    enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the
    primary beneficiary (or consolidator) of a VIE based on whether
    the entity (1) has the power to direct matters that most
    significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and (2) has
    the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
    of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The
    new guidance changes the consideration of kick-out rights in
    determining if an entity is a VIE which may cause certain
    additional entities to be considered VIE’s. It also
    requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary,
    and amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an
    entity is a VIE. The new guidance is effective January 1,
    2010 for calendar year-end companies. There is no grandfathering
    of previous consolidation conclusions. As a result, any existing
    VIE’s at date of adoption must be re-evaluated. The Company
    currently has no unconsolidated VIE’s; thus, this new
    guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations.

In August 2009, the FASB issued guidance to amend Accounting
    Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820,

Fair Value
    Measurements.

The update addresses practice difficulties
    caused by the tension between fair-value measurements based on
    the price that would be paid to transfer a liability to a new
    obligor and contractual or legal requirements that prevent such
    transfers from taking place. The guidance prescribes using the
    quoted price in an active market for an identical liability when
    traded as an asset to assign a fair value to debt. The new
    guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning
    after August 27, 2009, and applies to all required
    fair-value measurements of liabilities. No new fair-value
    measurements are required by the standard. The Company’s
    methodology for assessing and reporting the fair value of
    outstanding debt is consistent with that prescribed by this
    guidance.

In September 2009, the FASB amended ASC Subtopic

605-25,

Revenue Recognition — Multiple-Element Arrangements

to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements
    have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (VSOE) or Third-Party
    Evidence (TPE) of standalone selling price before an entity can
    recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is
    attributable to items that have been delivered. In the absence
    of VSOE or TPE of the standalone selling price for one or more
    delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple-element
    arrangement, entities will be required to estimate the selling
    prices of those elements. The overall arrangement fee will be
    allocated to each element (both delivered and undelivered items)
    based on their relative selling prices, regardless of whether
    those selling prices are evidenced by VSOE or TPE or are based
    on the entity’s estimated selling price. Application of the
    “residual method” of allocating an overall arrangement
    fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be
    permitted upon adoption of this new guidance. Additional
    disclosure will be required about multiple-element revenue
    arrangements, as well as qualitative and quantitative disclosure
    about the effect of the change. The amendment is effective
    prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted at the beginning
    of a fiscal year or applied retrospectively to the beginning of
    a fiscal year. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively
    as of January 1, 2010. The effect of the change for FIS
    will be a function of the new contracts entered into or
    materially modified after adoption, and relates primarily to
    arrangements that include software licenses with other service
    elements. Management expects this guidance to result in a modest
    increase in revenue in the year of adoption related to revenue
    that would have been deferred under the existing authoritative
    literature.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in
    interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use
    certain derivative financial instruments, including interest
    rate swaps, to manage interest rate risk. We do not use
    derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to
    engage in speculative activity.



Interest
    Rate Risk

At the present time, our only material market risk-sensitive
    instruments are our debt and related interest rate swaps. We
    have issued debt that bears interest at floating rates. We use
    interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest
    expense on the mix of fixed and floating rate debt. We manage
    interest rate sensitivity by measuring potential increases in
    interest expense that would result from a probable change in
    interest rates. When the potential increase in interest expense
    exceeds an acceptable amount, we reduce risk through the
    purchase of derivatives.

As of December 31, 2009, we are paying interest on our Term
    Loan A at LIBOR plus 0.88%, on our Metavante Term Loan at LIBOR
    plus 3.25%, on our Term Loan C at LIBOR plus 4.25%, and on our
    Revolving Loan at LIBOR plus 0.70%. An increase of
    100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would increase our
    annual debt service under the FIS Credit Agreement, after we
    calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps, by
    $7.0 million (based on principal amounts outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). We performed the foregoing sensitivity
    analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt
    as of December 31, 2009, less the principal amount of such
    debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting
    such debt into fixed rate debt. This sensitivity analysis is
    based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of
    December 31, 2009 and does not take into account any
    changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may
    take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our
    outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding
    interest rate swaps in respect of our debt. Further, in this
    sensitivity analysis, the change in interest rates is assumed to
    be applicable for an entire year. For comparison purposes, based
    on principal amounts on the Revolving Loan and Term Loan A
    outstanding as of December 31, 2008, and calculated in the
    same manner as set forth above, an increase of 100 basis
    points in the LIBOR rate would have increased our annual
    interest expense, after we calculate the impact of our interest
    rate swaps, by $3.9 million.

As of December 31, 2009, we have entered into the following
    interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the
    interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from
    variable to fixed (in millions):

We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow
    hedges. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as
    a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the
    Term and Revolving Loans. In accordance with the
    authoritative guidance for fair value



measurements, the inputs used to determine the estimated fair
    value of our interest rate swaps are

Level 2-type

measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit
    risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of
    our interest rate swaps.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks arises from our

non-U.S. operations

generally, to the extent they are conducted in local currency.
    Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations
    of revenues denominated in currencies other than
    U.S. dollars. Our international operations generated
    approximately $782.7 million in revenues during the year
    ended December 31, 2009, of which approximately $605.1
    million was denominated in currencies other than the
    U.S. Dollar. The major currencies that we are exposed to
    are the Brazilian Real, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
    A 10% move in average exchange rates for these currencies
    (assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10% change in all of such
    rates for the relevant period) would have had the following
    effects on our reported revenues for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in millions):

Total Impact

$

53.7

$

54.0

The impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10% change in
    each of the periods presented would not have been significant.

Our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of
    derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options,
    to reduce volatility in our results of operations

and/or

cash
    flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Our
    international operations’ revenues and expenses are
    generally denominated in local currency which limits the
    economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those
    jurisdictions. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative
    instruments for trading purposes.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited Fidelity National Information Services,
    Inc.’s and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”)
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and
    subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Fidelity National Information
    Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
    equity and comprehensive earnings and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and
    our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    and the related consolidated statements of earnings, equity and
    comprehensive earnings and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Fidelity
    National Information Services, Inc.’s and
    subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 26, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company completed a merger with Metavante
    Technologies, Inc. on October 1, 2009.

    (formerly known as Fidelity National Title Group, Inc.
    (“FNT”)), formerly a subsidiary of Old FNF but now an

    accounting perspective; and all references to “LPS”
    are to Lender Processing Services, Inc., a former wholly owned
    subsidiary of FIS which was spun-off as a separate publicly
    traded company on July 2, 2008 (Note 4).

(1)

Basis of
    Presentation

FIS is a leading global provider of banking and payments
    technology solutions, processing services and information-based
    services. On February 1, 2006, the Company completed a
    merger with Certegy (the “Certegy Merger”) which was
    accounted for as a reverse acquisition and purchase accounting
    was applied to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of
    Certegy. In form, Certegy was the legal acquirer in the Certegy
    Merger and the continuing registrant for Securities and Exchange
    Commission (the “SEC”) reporting purposes. However,
    due to the majority ownership in the combined entity held by FIS
    shareholders, FIS was designated the acquirer for accounting
    purposes and, effective on the Certegy Merger date, the
    historical financial statements of FIS became the historical
    financial statements of the continuing registrant for all
    periods prior to the Certegy Merger. Immediately after the
    Certegy Merger, the name of the SEC registrant was changed to
    Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

Subsequent to the LPS spin-off, we began reporting the results
    of our operations in four new reporting segments:
    1) Financial Solutions Group (“FSG”),
    2) Payment Solutions Group (“PSG”),
    3) International Solutions Group (“ISG”) and
    4) Corporate and Other. All prior periods presented have
    been conformed to reflect the segment changes.

(2)

Combination
    with Old FNF

On June 25, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement and
    plan of merger (the “FNF Merger Agreement”) with Old
    FNF (amended September 18, 2006) (the “FNF
    Merger”). The FNF Merger was one step in a plan that
    eliminated Old FNF’s holding company structure and majority
    ownership of FIS. Prior to the FNF Merger, substantially all of
    the remaining assets and liabilities of Old FNF other than its
    ownership interest in FIS were transferred to its subsidiary,
    Fidelity National Title Group, Inc. (“FNT”).
    Pursuant to the FNF Merger Agreement, on November 9, 2006,
    Old FNF merged with and into FIS, with FIS continuing as the
    surviving corporation. In consideration for the FNF Merger, Old
    FNF stockholders received an aggregate of 96.5 million
    shares of FIS stock for their Old FNF shares. In addition, FIS
    issued options to purchase FIS common stock and shares of FIS
    restricted stock in exchange for certain Old FNF options and
    restricted stock outstanding at the time of the FNF Merger.
    After the completion of all of the transactions, FNT was renamed
    Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (“FNF”) and now
    trades under the symbol FNF. Old FNF Chairman and CEO William P.
    Foley, II, assumed a similar position in FNF and now serves
    as its Chairman and as Executive Chairman of FIS, and other key
    members of Old FNF senior management continued their involvement
    in both FNF and FIS in executive capacities. U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles require that one of the two
    parties to the FNF Merger be designated as the acquirer for
    accounting purposes. However, if a transaction lacks substance,
    it is not a purchase event and should be accounted for based on
    existing carrying amounts. In the FNF Merger, the minority
    interest of FIS has not changed and the only assets and
    liabilities of the combined entity after the exchange are those
    of FIS prior to the exchange. Because a change in ownership of
    the minority interest did not take place, the FNF Merger has
    been accounted for based on the carrying amounts of FIS’
    assets and liabilities.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

The following describes the significant accounting policies of
    the Company which have been followed in preparing the
    accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

(a)

Principles
    of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    FIS, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries that are
    majority owned

and/or

over
    which it exercises substantive control. Investments in
    unconsolidated affiliates, in which FIS has 20 percent to
    50 percent of ownership interest and has the ability to
    exercise significant influence, but not substantive control,
    over the affiliate’s operating and financial policies, are
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

All significant intercompany profits, transactions and balances
    have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all cash on hand, money market funds and
    other highly liquid investments with original maturities of
    three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. As part of
    the Company’s payment processing business, the Company
    provides cash settlement services to financial institutions and
    state and local governments. These services involve the movement
    of funds between the various parties associated with ATM,

point-of-sale

or electronic benefit transactions (EBT) and this activity
    results in a balance due to the Company at the end of each
    business day that it recoups over the next few business days.
    The in-transit balances due the Company are included in cash and
    cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in the
    consolidated balance sheets for these instruments approximate
    their fair value. At December 31, 2009, we had cash and
    cash equivalents of $430.9 million of which approximately
    $195.4 million is held by our operations in foreign
    jurisdictions.

(c)

Fair
    Value Measurements

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
    for receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair
    values because of their immediate or short-term maturities. The
    fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated to
    be approximately $126.0 million and $502.0 million
    lower than the carrying value as of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. These estimates are based on values of
    trades of our debt in close proximity to year end, which are
    considered

Level 2-type

measurements as discussed below. These estimates are subjective
    in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment in
    the interpretation of current market data. Therefore, the values
    presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company
    could realize or settle currently. The Company holds, or has
    held, certain derivative instruments, specifically interest rate
    swaps and warrants relating to certain subsidiaries. As
    discussed in Note 14, interest rate swaps were valued using

Level 2-type

measurements.

Fair
    Value Hierarchy

The authoritative accounting literature defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
    establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of
    inputs used to measure fair value.

The fair value hierarchy includes three levels which are based
    on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The
    fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
    in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). If the inputs
    used to measure the fair value fall within different levels of
    the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the



FIDELITY

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement of the asset or liability. The three levels of the
    fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1.

Inputs to the valuation
    methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or
    liabilities in active markets.

Level 2.

Inputs to the valuation
    methodology include:

•

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
    markets;

•

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
    inactive markets;

•

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
    asset or liability;

•

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data by correlation or other means.

If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term,
    the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the
    full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3.

Inputs to the valuation
    methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value
    measurement. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the
    reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions
    market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
    developed based on the best information available in the
    circumstances.

Nonrecurring
    Fair Value Measurements

Generally accepted accounting principles require that,
    subsequent to their initial recognition, certain assets be
    reviewed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis by comparison to
    their fair value. As more fully discussed in their respective
    subheadings below, this includes goodwill, long-lived assets,
    intangible assets and computer software. Following is a summary
    of the fair value measurement impairments recognized in 2009 for
    assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in
    accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
    Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company engaged in hedging activities relating to its variable
    rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company
    designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. The
    estimated fair values of the cash flow hedges are recorded as an
    asset or liability of the Company and are included in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in prepaid expenses and
    other current assets, other non-current assets,

accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other long-term
    liabilities, as appropriate, and as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. A portion
    of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive
    earnings is recorded in interest expense as a yield adjustment
    as interest payments are made on the Company’s Term and
    Revolving Loans (Note 14). The Company’s existing cash
    flow hedges are highly effective and there was an immaterial
    impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It is our
    policy to execute such instruments with credit-worthy banks at
    the time of execution and not to enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative purposes. As of December 31,
    2009, we believe that our interest rate swap counterparties will
    be able to fulfill their obligations under our agreements.

In November 2007, Metavante entered into an interest rate swap
    with Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc.
    (“LBSFI”), which subsequently filed for protection
    under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as
    amended. Because of the uncertainty surrounding LBSFI’s
    ability to perform its obligations relative to the net
    settlement feature of the interest rate swap, it has been
    accounted for as a contingent liability. At acquisition, FIS
    recorded a liability related to the derivative based on its fair
    value at October 1, 2009, and will account for the
    liability under FASB ASC

Section 805-20-25.

Subsequent to acquisition, the Company has made payments related
    to previous interest accrued on the swap totaling
    $16.2 million and is current on interest payments as of
    December 31, 2009. The Company has accrued a
    $19.8 million liability related to this contingency at
    December 31, 2009. See Note 16 for additional
    information.

The Company records settlement
    receivables and payables that result from timing differences in
    the Company’s settlement process with merchants, financial
    institutions, and credit card associations related to merchant
    and card transaction processing and third-party check
    collections. Cash held by FIS associated with this settlement
    process is classified as settlement deposits in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

(f)

Other
    receivables

Other receivables represent amounts due from consumers related
    to deferred debit processing services and other amounts
    including income taxes receivable. A significant portion of the
    amounts due from consumers at December 31, 2008
    ($81.7 million) related to Certegy Australia, Ltd., which
    was sold on October 13, 2008. On December 1, 2009, we
    sold the remaining balance of the amounts due from consumers for
    $17.5 million, recognizing a pretax gain of
    $0.5 million on the sale. An additional pre-tax gain of
    $8.1 million was recorded related to the release of
    cumulative translation adjustments from other comprehensive
    earnings upon final disposition. The gain is included in our
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings as earnings from
    discontinued operations.

(g)

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of
    identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
    business combinations. FASB ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles — Goodwill and Other

requires that
    intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over
    their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated
    residual values and be reviewed for impairment in accordance
    with the

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

Subsection of FASB ASC

Section 360-10-35.

The authoritative guidance also provides that goodwill and other
    intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be
    amortized, but shall be tested for impairment annually or more
    frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment,
    through a comparison of fair value to their carrying amounts.
    The Company measures for impairment on an annual basis during
    the fourth quarter using a September 30th measurement
    date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement.



FIDELITY
    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(h)

Long-lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite useful
    lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used
    is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
    estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
    generated by the asset, which are

Level 3-type

measurements. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
    estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized
    in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
    the fair value of the asset.

(i)

Intangible
    Assets

The Company has intangible assets which consist primarily of
    customer relationships that are recorded in connection with
    acquisitions at their fair value based on the results of
    valuation analysis. Customer relationships are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method which
    takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates up to
    a ten-year period. Intangible assets with estimated useful lives
    (principally customer relationships and certain trademarks) are
    reviewed for impairment in accordance with the

Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

Subsection of FASB ASC

Section 360-10-35,

while certain trademarks determined to have indefinite lives are
    reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with
    FASB ASC Topic 350.

(j)

Computer
    Software

Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired
    in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized
    software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at
    cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its
    estimated useful life and software acquired in business
    combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using
    straight-line or accelerated methods over its estimated useful
    life, ranging from five to ten years.

The capitalization of software development costs is governed by
    FASB ASC Subtopic

985-20

if
    the software is to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, or by
    FASB ASC Subtopic

350-40

if
    the software is for internal use. After the technological
    feasibility of the software has been established (for software
    to be marketed), or at the beginning of application development
    (for internal-use software), software development costs, which
    include salaries and related payroll costs and costs of
    independent contractors incurred during development, are
    capitalized. Research and development costs incurred prior to
    the establishment of technological feasibility (for software to
    be marketed), or prior to application development (for
    internal-use software), are expensed as incurred. Software
    development costs are amortized on a product by product basis
    commencing on the date of general release of the products (for
    software to be marketed) and the date placed in service for
    purchased software (for internal-use software). Software
    development costs (for software to be marketed) are amortized
    using the greater of (1) the straight-line method over its
    estimated useful life, which ranges from three to ten years or
    (2) the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated
    revenue over its useful life.

(k)

Deferred
    Contract Costs

Costs of software sales and outsourced data processing and
    application management arrangements, including costs incurred
    for bid and proposal activities, are generally expensed as
    incurred. However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of a
    contract are deferred and expensed over the contract life. These
    costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific
    internal costs that are directly related to the contract
    acquisition or transition activities and are primarily
    associated with installation of systems/processes and data
    conversion.

In the event indications exist that a particular deferred
    contract cost balance may be impaired, undiscounted estimated
    cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining term
    and compared to the unamortized deferred contract cost balance.
    If the projected cash flows are not adequate to recover the
    unamortized cost balance, the

balance would be adjusted to equal the contract’s net
    realizable value, including any termination fees provided for
    under the contract, in the period such a determination is made.

(l)

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
    computed primarily using the straight-line method based on the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets: thirty years for
    buildings and three to seven years for furniture, fixtures and
    computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using
    the straight-line method over the lesser of the initial term of
    the applicable lease or the estimated useful lives of such
    assets.

(m)

Income
    Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities for temporary differences between the financial
    reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets
    and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating
    loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact
    on deferred income taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if
    any, is reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    the period enacted.

(n)

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank
    processing, credit and debit card processing services, other
    payment processing services, professional services, software
    licensing and software related services and products. The
    Company recognizes revenue when: (i) evidence of an
    arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred;
    (iii) the fees are fixed or determinable; and
    (iv) collection is considered probable.

The following describes the Company’s primary types of
    revenues and its revenue recognition policies as they pertain to
    the types of transactions the Company enters into with its
    customers. The Company enters into arrangements with customers
    to provide services, software and software-related services such
    as post-contract customer support and implementation and
    training either individually or as part of an integrated
    offering of multiple services. These services occasionally
    include offerings from more than one segment to the same
    customer. The revenues for services provided under these
    multiple element arrangements are recognized in accordance with
    the applicable revenue recognition accounting principles as
    further described below.

Processing
    Services

Processing services include data processing and application
    management. Revenues from processing services are typically
    volume-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts
    processed, transactions processed and computer resources
    utilized. Revenues from these arrangements are recognized as
    services are performed.

In the event that the Company’s arrangements with its
    customers include more than one service, the Company determines
    whether the individual revenue elements can be recognized
    separately. An arrangement containing more than one deliverable
    is considered a separate unit of accounting if all the following
    criteria are met: the item has value to a customer on a
    standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of
    fair value of the item; and, if the arrangement includes a
    general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery
    or performance of the item is considered probable and
    substantially in the Company’s control.

A relatively small percentage of credit card processing revenue
    is generated from the merchant institution processing business,
    where the relationship is with the financial institution that
    contracts directly with the merchant. In this business, the
    Company is responsible for collecting and settling interchange
    fees with the credit card associations. Whether a company should
    recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer
    or the



FIDELITY
    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

net amount retained is a matter of judgment that depends on the
    relevant facts and circumstances. Certain factors or indicators
    have been identified in the authoritative literature that should
    be considered in the evaluation. The Company has evaluated the
    indicators and records the interchange fees revenue on a gross
    basis and the related costs are included in cost of revenue in
    arrangements where the Company is considered the primary obligor
    and bears credit risk associated with the transactions.

Professional
    Service Revenues

Revenues and costs related to implementation, conversion and
    programming services associated with the Company’s data
    processing and application management agreements during the
    implementation phase are deferred and subsequently recognized
    using the straight-line method over the term of the related
    services agreement. The Company evaluates these deferred
    contract costs for impairment in the event any indications of
    impairment exist.

Revenues and costs related to other consulting service
    agreements are recognized as the services are provided, assuming
    the separation criteria outlined above are satisfied.

License
    and Software Related Revenues

The Company recognizes software license and post-contract
    customer support fees as well as associated implementation,
    training, conversion and programming fees in accordance with
    FASB ASC Subtopic

985-605.

Initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists, the
    fee is fixed or determinable, software delivery has occurred and
    collection of the receivable is deemed probable, provided that
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair
    value has been established for each element or for any
    undelivered elements. VSOE for each element is based on the
    price charged when the same element is sold separately, or in
    the case of post-contract customer support, when a substantive
    stated renewal rate is provided to the customer. If evidence of
    fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does
    not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is
    recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method,
    the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the
    remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as
    revenue. If evidence of fair value does not exist for one or
    more undelivered elements of a contract, then all revenue is
    deferred until all elements are delivered or fair value is
    determined for all remaining undelivered elements. Revenue from
    post-contract customer support is recognized ratably over the
    term of the agreement. The Company records deferred revenue for
    all billings invoiced prior to revenue recognition.

With respect to a small percentage of revenues, the Company uses
    contract accounting, when the arrangement with the customer
    includes significant customization, modification, or production
    of software. For elements accounted for under contract
    accounting, revenue is recognized using the

percentage-of-completion

method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and
    contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can
    be made. Revenues in excess of billings on these agreements are
    recorded as unbilled receivables and are included in trade
    receivables. Billings in excess of revenue recognized on these
    agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue
    recognition criteria are met. Changes in estimates for revenues,
    costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are
    determinable. When the Company’s estimates indicate that
    the entire contract will be performed at a loss, a provision for
    the entire loss is recorded in that accounting period.

In arrangements where the licensed software includes hosting the
    software for the customer, a software element is only considered
    present if the customer has the contractual right to take
    possession of the software at any time during the hosting period
    without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer
    to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract
    with another vendor to host the software. If the arrangement
    meets these criteria, as well as the other criteria for
    recognition of the license revenues described above, a software
    element is present and license revenues are recognized when the
    software is delivered and hosting revenues are recognized as the
    service is provided. If a separate software element as described
    above is not present, the related revenues are combined and
    recognized ratably over the hosting or maintenance period,
    whichever is longer.



FIDELITY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Hardware revenue is recognized as a delivered element following
    the separation and recognition criteria discussed above. The
    Company does not stock in inventory the hardware products sold,
    but arranges for delivery of hardware from third-party
    suppliers. The Company has evaluated the gross vs. net
    indicators for these transactions and records the revenue
    related to hardware transactions on a gross basis and the
    related costs are included in cost of revenue as the Company is
    considered the primary obligor by the customer, bears risk of
    loss, and has latitude in establishing prices on the equipment.

(o)

Cost
    of revenue and selling, general and administrative
    expenses

Cost of revenue includes payroll, employee benefits, occupancy
    costs and other costs associated with personnel employed in
    customer service roles, including program design and development
    and professional services. Cost of revenue also includes data
    processing costs, amortization of software, customer
    relationship intangible assets and depreciation on operating
    assets.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include payroll,
    employee benefits, occupancy and other costs associated with
    personnel employed in sales, marketing, human resources and
    finance roles. Selling, general and administrative expenses also
    include depreciation on non-operating corporate assets,
    advertising costs and other marketing-related programs.

(p)

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation plans using
    the fair value method. Thus, compensation cost is measured based
    on the fair value of the award at the grant date and is
    recognized over the service period.

(q)

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency for the foreign operations of the
    Company is either the U.S. Dollar or the local currency.
    For foreign operations where the local currency is the
    functional currency, the translation of foreign currencies into
    U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using
    exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for
    revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange
    rate during the period. The gains and losses resulting from the
    translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    earnings (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Equity and
    Comprehensive Earnings and are excluded from net earnings.
    Realized gains or losses resulting from other foreign currency
    transactions are included in other income.

(r)

Management
    Estimates

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

(s)

Check
    Guarantee Reserves

In the Company’s check guarantee business, if a guaranteed
    check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the
    check writer’s bank, the Company reimburses the merchant
    customer for the check’s face value and pursues collection
    of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves
    and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by
    performing a historical analysis of the Company’s check
    loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that
    could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include
    the general economy, the overall industry mix of customer
    volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within
    customer volumes, and the quality of returned checks. Once these
    factors are considered, the Company establishes a rate for check

losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses
    by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries
    that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the
    total amount of related check losses. These rates are then
    applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses,
    respectively, each month and charged to cost of revenue. The
    estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk
    that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than
    the Company’s estimates. The Company had accrued claims
    payable balances of $18.3 million and $24.0 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to these
    estimations. The Company had accrued claims recoverable of
    $22.5 million and $28.4 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, related to these estimations. In
    addition, the Company recorded check guarantee losses, net of
    anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of
    $83.3 million, $115.2 million and $129.2 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The amount paid to merchant customers, net of
    amounts recovered from check writers excluding service fees, was
    $72.4 million, $100.7 million and $126.7 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued new guidance requiring an acquirer in a business
    combination to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities
    assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at
    their fair values at the acquisition date, with limited
    exceptions. The costs of the acquisition and any related
    restructuring costs are to be recognized separately. When the
    fair value of assets acquired exceeds the fair value of
    consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in
    the acquiree, the excess will be recognized as a gain. All
    business combinations will be accounted for prospectively by
    applying the acquisition method, including combinations among
    mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. In April
    2009, the FASB amended and clarified the initial recognition and
    measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and related
    disclosures arising from contingencies in a business
    combination. Assets and liabilities arising from contingencies
    in a business combination are to be recognized at their fair
    value on the acquisition date if fair value can be determined
    during the measurement period. If fair value cannot be
    determined, the existing guidance for contingencies and other
    authoritative literature should be followed. This new guidance
    is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15,
    2008, and applies to business combinations occurring after the
    effective date. The Company has applied the provisions to the
    Metavante combination, and will apply the provisions
    prospectively for any future business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance relative to
    noncontrolling interests (sometimes called minority interests),
    requiring: (1) that noncontrolling interests be presented
    as a component of equity on the balance sheet; (2) that the
    amount of net earnings attributable to the parent and to the
    noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented on
    the face of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings; and
    (3) expanded disclosures that identify and distinguish
    between the interests of the parent’s owners and the
    interests of the non-controlling owners of subsidiaries. The
    Company adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements as
    of January 1, 2009, with retrospective application for all
    periods presented.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance for transfers and
    servicing of financial assets. The primary changes include:
    (1) the elimination of the “qualified special purpose
    entity” concept, and the exception that allowed many
    transferors to deconsolidate such entities; (2) a new
    “participating interest” definition that must be met
    for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for
    sale accounting; (3) clarification and amendments to the
    derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a
    sale; (4) a change to the amount of recognized gain/loss on
    a transfer accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are
    received by the transferor; and (5) enhanced disclosure
    requirements. This new guidance will be applied prospectively to
    new transfers of financial assets occurring in fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2009.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new consolidation guidance for
    variable interest entities (VIE’s). It requires an
    enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the
    primary beneficiary (or consolidator) of a VIE based on whether
    the entity (1) has the power to direct matters that most
    significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and (2) has
    the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
    of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The
    new guidance changes the consideration of kick-out rights in
    determining if an entity is a VIE which may cause certain
    additional entities to be considered VIE’s. It also
    requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary,
    and amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an
    entity is a VIE. The new guidance is effective January 1,
    2010 for calendar year-end companies. There is no grandfathering
    of previous consolidation conclusions. As a result, any existing
    VIE’s at date of adoption must be re-evaluated. The Company
    currently has no unconsolidated VIE’s; thus, this new
    guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations.

In August 2009, the FASB issued guidance to amend Accounting
    Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820,

Fair Value
    Measurements.

The update addresses practice difficulties
    caused by the tension between fair-value measurements based on
    the price that would be paid to transfer a liability to a new
    obligor and contractual or legal requirements that prevent such
    transfers from taking place. The guidance prescribes using the
    quoted price in an



FIDELITY
    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

active market for an identical liability when traded as an asset
    to assign a fair value to debt. The new guidance is effective
    for interim and annual periods beginning after August 27,
    2009, and applies to all required fair-value measurements of
    liabilities. No new fair-value measurements are required by the
    standard. The Company’s methodology for assessing and
    reporting the fair value of outstanding debt is consistent with
    that prescribed by this guidance.

In September 2009, the FASB amended ASC Subtopic

605-25,

Revenue Recognition — Multiple-Element Arrangements

to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements
    have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (VSOE) or Third-Party
    Evidence (TPE) of standalone selling price before an entity can
    recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is
    attributable to items that have been delivered. In the absence
    of VSOE or TPE of the standalone selling price for one or more
    delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple-element
    arrangement, entities will be required to estimate the selling
    prices of those elements. The overall arrangement fee will be
    allocated to each element (both delivered and undelivered items)
    based on their relative selling prices, regardless of whether
    those selling prices are evidenced by VSOE or TPE or are based
    on the entity’s estimated selling price. Application of the
    “residual method” of allocating an overall arrangement
    fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be
    permitted upon adoption of this new guidance. Additional
    disclosure will be required about multiple-element revenue
    arrangements, as well as qualitative and quantitative disclosure
    about the effect of the change. The amendment is effective
    prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted at the beginning
    of a fiscal year or applied retrospectively to the beginning of
    a fiscal year. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively
    as of January 1, 2010. The effect of the change for FIS
    will be a function of the new contracts entered into or
    materially modified after adoption, and relates primarily to
    arrangements that include software licenses with other service
    elements. Management expects this guidance to result in a modest
    increase in revenue in the year of adoption related to revenue
    that would have been deferred under the existing authoritative
    literature.

Discontinued
    Operations

During 2009 and 2008, certain operations are reported as
    discontinued in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Interest is
    allocated to discontinued operations based on debt to be retired
    and debt specifically identified as related to the respective
    discontinued operation.

ClearPar

On October 30, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement
    to sell ClearPar because its operations did not align with our
    strategic plans. The net assets were classified as held for sale
    at December 31, 2009, and the transaction was closed on
    January 1, 2010. We received proceeds of
    $71.5 million, realizing a pretax gain on sale of
    $5.7 million and an after tax loss of ($9.8) million
    resulting from permanent tax differences associated with the
    allocation of goodwill. ClearPar had revenues of
    $20.8 million, $18.3 million and $28.1 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. ClearPar had earnings before taxes of
    $12.2 million, $11.1 million and $20.3 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

LPS

On July 2, 2008, all of the shares of the common stock, par
    value $0.0001 per share, of Lender Processing Services, Inc.
    (“LPS”) were distributed to FIS shareholders through a
    stock dividend (the “spin-off”). At the time of the
    distribution, LPS consisted of substantially all the assets,
    liabilities, businesses and employees related to FIS’

Lender Processing Services segment. Upon the distribution, FIS
    shareholders received one-half share of LPS common stock for
    every share of FIS common stock held as of the close of business
    on June 24, 2008. The results of operations of the former
    Lender Processing Services segment of FIS are reflected as
    discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.
    The Lender Processing Services segment had revenues of
    $913.1 million and $1,686.6 million for the period
    from January 1, 2008 through July 2, 2008 and for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, respectively. The Lender
    Processing Services segment had earnings before taxes of
    $188.4 million and $412.3 million for the period from
    January 1, 2008 through July 2, 2008 and for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, respectively.

    provided to us, and to a lesser extent we have provided to FNF,
    certain administrative support services relating to general
    management and administration. The pricing for these services,
    both to and from FNF, is at cost. We also incurred expenses for
    amounts paid by us to FNF under leases of certain personal
    property and technology equipment.

FNF
    and THL Investment

On October 1, 2009, pursuant to an investment agreement
    with Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (“THL”) and FNF
    dated as of March 31, 2009, FIS issued and sold (a) to
    THL in a private placement 12.9 million shares of FIS
    common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
    $200.0 million and (b) to FNF in a private placement
    3.2 million shares of FIS common stock for an aggregate
    purchase price of approximately $50.0 million. FIS paid
    each of THL and FNF a transaction fee equal to 3% of their
    respective investments. The investment agreement provides that
    neither THL nor FNF may transfer the shares purchased in the
    investments, subject to limited exceptions, for 180 days
    after the closing. Contingent upon THL maintaining certain
    ownership levels in FIS common stock, THL has the right to
    designate one member to the Company’s board of directors.

Ceridian

We provide data processing services to Ceridian Corporation
    (“Ceridian”), a company in which FNF holds an
    approximate 33% equity interest.

Sedgwick

We provide data processing services to Sedgwick CMS, Inc.
    (“Sedgwick”), a company in which FNF holds an
    approximate 32% equity interest.

LPS

We provide transitional services to LPS as a result of the
    spin-off. In addition, we have entered into certain property
    management and real estate lease agreements with LPS relating to
    our Jacksonville corporate headquarters.

We believe the amounts earned from or charged by us under each
    of the foregoing arrangements are fair and reasonable. We
    believe our service arrangements are priced within the range of
    prices we offer to third parties. However, the amounts we earned
    or that were charged under these arrangements were not
    negotiated at arm’s-length, and may not represent the terms
    that we might have obtained from an unrelated third party.

Discontinued

    earnings from discontinued operations for the period from
    January 1, 2007 through August 31, 2007.

Through July 2, 2008, LPS provided a number of services to
    FNF that are now presented as discontinued operations. These
    services included title agency services, software development
    services, real estate related services and other cost sharing
    services. These activities are included within net earnings from

The results of operations and financial position of the entities
    acquired during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008,
    and 2007 are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
    from and after the date of acquisition. There were no
    significant acquisitions in 2008.

    Significant Acquisition

Metavante

On October 1, 2009, we completed the acquisition of
    Metavante (the “Metavante Acquisition”). Metavante
    expands the scale of FIS core processing and payment
    capabilities, adds trust and wealth management services and
    includes the NYCE Network, a leading national EFT network. In
    addition, Metavante adds significant scale to treasury and cash
    management offerings and provides an entry into the emerging
    markets of healthcare and government payments. Pursuant to the
    Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Metavante Merger
    Agreement”) dated as of March 31, 2009, Metavante
    became a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIS. Each issued and
    outstanding share of Metavante common stock, par value $0.01 per
    share, was converted into 1.35 shares of FIS common stock.
    In addition, outstanding Metavante stock options and other
    stock-based awards converted into comparable FIS stock options
    and other stock-based awards at the same conversion ratio.

The total purchase price was as follows (in millions):

We have recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price

    of October 1, 2009. Goodwill has been recorded based on the
    amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the
    net assets acquired. The preliminary purchase price allocation
    is as follows (in millions):

The preliminary allocation of the purchase price to intangible

    is based on valuations performed to determine the fair value of
    such assets as of the merger date. The Company is still
    assessing the economic characteristics of certain software
    projects and customer relationships. The Company expects to
    substantially complete this assessment during the first quarter
    of 2010 and may adjust the amounts recorded as of
    December 31, 2009 to reflect any revised evaluations. Land
    and building valuations are based upon appraisals performed by
    certified property appraisers.

In connection with the Metavante Acquisition, we also acquired

    12.2 million options and 0.6 million restricted stock
    units in replacement of similar outstanding awards held by
    Metavante employees. The amounts attributable to vested options
    are included as an adjustment to the purchase price, and the
    amounts attributable to unvested options and restricted stock
    units will be expensed over the remaining vesting period based
    on a valuation as of the date of closing.

As of the acquisition date, WPM, L.P., a Delaware limited
    partnership affiliated with Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX,
    L.P. (collectively “Warburg Pincus”) owned 25% of the
    outstanding shares of Metavante common stock, and was a party to
    a purchase right agreement with Metavante which granted Warburg
    Pincus the right to purchase additional shares of Metavante
    common stock under certain conditions in order to maintain its
    interest. The Company and Warburg Pincus entered into a
    replacement stock purchase right agreement effective upon
    consummation of the merger, granting Warburg Pincus the right to
    purchase comparable FIS shares in lieu of Metavante shares. The
    purchase right agreement relates to Metavante employee stock
    options that were outstanding as of the date of Warburg
    Pincus’ initial investment in Metavante. The stock purchase
    right may be exercised quarterly for the difference between
    one-third of the number of said employee stock options exercised
    during the preceding quarter and the quotient of one-third of
    the aggregate exercise prices of such options exercised divided
    by the quoted closing price of a common share on the day
    immediately before exercise of the purchase right. As of
    October 1, 2009, approximately 7.0 million options
    remained outstanding that were subject to this purchase right,
    and approximately 0.5 million were exercised during the
    fourth quarter of 2009.

Pro Forma
    Results

Metavante’s revenues of $404.1 million for the fourth
    quarter of 2009 are included in the Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings. Disclosure of the earnings of Metavante since the

    Significant Acquisition

eFunds
    Corporation

On September 12, 2007, we completed the acquisition of
    eFunds (the “eFunds Acquisition”). This acquisition
    expanded our presence in risk management services, EFT services,
    prepaid/gift card processing, and global outsourcing solutions
    to financial services companies in the U.S. and
    internationally. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger
    (the “eFunds Merger Agreement”) dated as of
    June 26, 2007, eFunds became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    FIS. The issued and outstanding shares of eFunds common stock,
    par value $0.01 per share, were converted into the right to
    receive $36.50 per share in cash.

    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, we
    accelerated the vesting of all stock awards held by eFunds
    employees. As a result we recorded $14.1 million in
    additional stock compensation expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

    approximately $430.2 million and recognized a pretax gain
    of approximately $274.5 million related to the sale of our
    investment in Covansys. Additionally, we held Covansys warrants
    in 2007 that were accounted for as available for sale securities
    prior to their exercise. Net of tax, amounts recognized in other
    comprehensive earnings in 2007 related to the Covansys warrants
    were $7.6 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had no
    remaining interest in Covansys.

Brazilian
    Venture

In March 2006, we entered into an agreement with ABN AMRO Real
    (“ABN”) and Banco Bradesco S.A. (“Bradesco”)
    (collectively, “banks”) to form a venture to provide
    comprehensive, fully outsourced card processing services to
    Brazilian card issuers. In exchange for a 51% controlling
    interest in the venture, we contributed our existing Brazilian
    card processing business contracts and Brazilian card processing
    infrastructure and made enhancements to our card processing
    system to meet the needs of the banks and their affiliates. The
    banks executed long-term contracts to process their card
    portfolios with the venture in exchange for an aggregate 49%
    interest. The accounting entries for this transaction were
    recorded during 2008 when certain walkaway rights lapsed,
    resulting in the establishment of a contract intangible asset of
    $224.2 million and a liability for amounts payable to the
    banks upon final migration of their respective card portfolios
    and achieving targeted volumes (the “Brazilian Venture
    Notes”). This related party payable was $73.0 million
    and $58.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

During 2009, after a downstream merger of legal entities in
    Brazil that pushed tax deductible goodwill into the venture, we
    determined that the contract intangible asset established in
    2008 created a deferred tax liability of $73.2 million due
    to a tax basis lower than the book value recorded. Furthermore,
    the tax deductible goodwill within the venture should have had
    the impact of increasing the enterprise valuation used to
    determine the fair value of the acquired contracts. The impact
    of these two items increased the amount that should have been
    recorded for the contract intangible by a total of
    $83.8 million. The deferred tax liability and the contract
    intangible balances were adjusted by these amounts as of
    December 31, 2009. The incremental value assigned to the
    intangible asset will result in additional amortization, to be
    recorded as a reduction in revenue. The impact to previously
    issued Consolidated Statements of Earnings was insignificant and
    there is no impact of this correction on the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows.

Through December 31, 2008, we contributed approximately
    $93.8 million of development costs to the venture based on
    exchange rates as of December 31, 2008. Development costs
    in excess of Real 79.0 million ($33.8 million) are to
    be contractually shared by the parties: 75% by us and 25% by the
    banks. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the banks contributed
    $14.7 million representing their 25% share. During 2009,
    the venture incurred an additional $46.1 million of
    development costs that were funded from operating cash flows and
    local borrowings.

Intangible
    Assets

Customer relationships intangible assets are generally obtained
    as part of acquired businesses and are amortized over their
    estimated useful lives, generally 5 to 10 years using
    accelerated methods. Trademarks determined to have indefinite
    lives are not amortized. Certain other trademarks are amortized
    over periods ranging up to fifteen years. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, trademarks carried at
    $49.1 million and $152.0 million, respectively, were

    expense on intangible assets of $19.0 million and
    $44.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. The Company introduced a new brand
    identity in conjunction with the October 1, 2009 Metavante
    acquisition, giving rise to a pre-tax impairment charge of
    $124.0 million to certain previously acquired trademarks.
    During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a
    pre-tax impairment charge of $52.0 million to reduce the
    carrying value of a trademark related to the Company’s
    retail check business to its estimated fair value, due to
    declining check volumes and the sale of our Australian check
    business. We estimated the fair value of the check trademark by
    utilizing a relief from royalty methodology. Under this method,
    we estimate the amount of cash flows that, without owning the
    trademark, we would have had to pay to license the trademark.
    These estimated cash flows were then discounted to determine the
    fair value. Additionally, the trademark, previously accounted
    for as an indefinite lived intangible asset, was determined to
    no longer be indefinite and has an estimated useful life of
    15 years and is being amortized straight line over its
    remaining life. Approximately $26.0 million of this charge
    is included in cost of revenues in our Consolidated Statements
    of Earnings and was recorded in the Corporate and Other segment
    and $26.0 million (approximately $17.7 million net of
    tax) is included in discontinued operations in our Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings, as a portion of the charge related to
    the Company’s Australian retail check business disposed of

On January 18, 2007, we entered into a five-year syndicated
    unsecured credit agreement (the “FIS Credit
    Agreement”). The FIS Credit Agreement provides total
    committed capital of $3,000.0 million comprised of
    $2,100.0 million of term notes (the “Term Loan
    A”) and $900.0 million of revolving capacity (the
    “Revolving Loan”). The Revolving Loan is bifurcated
    into two tranches; a $165.0 million tranche that allows
    borrowings in U.S. Dollars only and a $735.0 million
    multicurrency tranche that allows borrowings in
    U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling, and
    Australian Dollars. The multicurrency tranche of the Revolving
    Loan includes a sublimit of $250.0 million for swing line
    loans and a $250.0 million sublimit for the issuance of
    letters of credit. In addition, the FIS Credit Agreement
    originally provided for an uncommitted incremental loan facility
    in the maximum principal amount of $600.0 million.

To facilitate our acquisition of eFunds, on July 30, 2007,
    we executed an amendment to the FIS Credit Agreement to increase
    the permitted maximum principal of uncommitted incremental loans
    from $600.0 million to

$2,100.0 million and converted the facility from unsecured
    to secured. On September 12, 2007, the amendment became
    effective, and we entered into a joinder agreement to obtain
    $1,600.0 million of term loans (the “Term Loan
    B”). On July 2, 2008, in conjunction with the spin-off
    of Lender Processing Services, Inc., $1,585.0 million, the
    then outstanding principal balance, of Term Loan B, was retired.

On November 1, 2007, Metavante entered into a credit
    agreement (the “MV Credit Agreement) for an aggregate
    principal amount of $2,000.0 million comprised of
    $1,750.0 million of seven-year term loans (the “MV
    Term Loan”) and a six-year revolving capacity of
    $250.0 million (the “MV Revolving Loan”).
    Immediately preceding the merger of FIS and Metavante, the
    outstanding balances of the MV Term Loan and MV Revolving Loan
    were $1,723.8 million and $0, respectively.

On October 1, 2009, contemporaneous with the closing of the
    Metavante merger, FIS obtained $500.0 million of term loans
    (the “Term Loan C”), utilizing the $500.0 million
    of remaining uncommitted incremental loans under the
    September 12, 2007 amendment of the FIS Credit Agreement.
    FIS exchanged the $500.0 million of Term Loan C for
    $500.0 million of the MV Term Loan (which portion was
    subsequently cancelled). In addition, on October 1, 2009,
    FIS purchased $423.8 million of the remaining MV Term Loan,
    which loans were deemed to be contemporaneously cancelled. After
    giving effect to the exchange, purchase and cancellation, the
    aggregate principal amount of the MV Term Loan outstanding as of
    October 1, 2009 was $800.0 million.

Also on October 1, 2009, FIS entered into an agreement to
    sell certain of its accounts receivable (the “AR
    Facility”) to a wholly-owned special purpose accounts
    receivable and financing entity (the “SPV”), which is
    exclusively engaged in purchasing receivables from FIS. The SPV
    funds its purchases, in part, by selling interests in the
    accounts receivables to a syndicate of financial institution
    purchasers in exchange for up to $145.0 million in capital
    funding (provided, however, that if FIS obtains additional
    commitments from new or existing purchasers, the aggregate
    amount may be increased by up to an additional $55.0 million, to
    an overall aggregate capital amount of $200.0 million). The
    sales to the purchasers do not qualify for sale treatment as we
    maintain effective control over the receivables that are sold.
    Thus, the SPV is included in our consolidated financial
    statements. At December 31, 2009, there was no outstanding
    capital under the accounts receivable facility.

We may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the Revolving
    Loan from time to time until the maturity of the Revolving Loan.
    We must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A
    of $52.5 million per quarter from March 31, 2010
    through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance of
    $1.522.5 million payable on January 18, 2012. As of
    December 31, 2009, there are no longer any mandatory
    quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan C as these
    requirements have been fulfilled in full due to principal
    prepayments made during the quarter ended December 31,
    2009. The remaining principal balance of the Term Loan C is
    payable on January 18, 2012. We must make quarterly
    principal payments on the MV Term Loan in the amount of
    $2.0 million on the first business day of each February,
    May, August, and November with the balance of
    $759.4 million payable on November 1, 2014.

In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the term loans
    are (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory prepayment
    upon the occurrence of certain events. There were no mandatory
    prepayments owed for the period ended December 31, 2009.
    Voluntary prepayment of the term loans is generally permitted at
    any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum
    dollar requirement. Commitment reductions of the Revolving Loan
    are also permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice.
    The Revolving Loan has no scheduled principal payments, but it
    will be due and payable in full on January 18, 2012.

The FIS Credit Agreement matures on January 18, 2012,
    unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the
    provisions of the agreement. Borrowings under the FIS Credit
    Agreement bear interest at (i) LIBOR plus an applicable
    margin or (ii) a Base Rate plus an applicable margin. The
    FIS Credit Agreement defines Base Rate as the higher of
    (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (b) the
    rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced
    from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
    (“JPMCB”) as its “prime rate”. For the
    purposes of the Term C Loan, the definition of Base Rate was
    amended to include one-month LIBOR plus 1%. We pay a commitment
    fee on the Revolving Loan of 0.18% per annum, as of
    December 31, 2009.

The MV Credit Agreement matures on November 1, 2014, unless
    extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions
    of the agreement. Borrowings under the MV Credit Agreement bear
    interest at (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or
    (ii) a Base Rate plus an applicable margin. The MV Credit
    Agreement defines Base Rate as the higher of (a) the
    Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest
    in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time
    by JPMCB as its “Prime Rate” and (c) one-month
    LIBOR plus 1%.

The AR Facility matures on November 1, 2013, unless
    extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions
    of the agreement. Borrowings under the AR Facility bear interest
    at (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (ii) a Base
    Rate plus an applicable margin. The AR Facility Agreement
    defines Base Rate as the higher of (a) the Federal Funds
    Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for
    such day as publicly announced from time to time by JPMCB as its
    Prime Rate and (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. In addition, we
    pay an unused commitment fee of 1% per annum. At
    December 31, 2009, there was no outstanding capital under
    the accounts receivable facility.

The FIS Credit Agreement, MV Credit Agreement, and AR Facility
    remain subject to customary affirmative, negative and financial
    covenants included in the FIS Credit Agreement, including, among
    other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on the
    incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on investments and
    dispositions, limitations on dividends and other restricted
    payments, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum
    leverage ratio. Upon an event of default under the FIS Credit
    Agreement or MV Credit Agreement, the administrative agent can
    accelerate the maturity of all amounts borrowed. Events of
    default include the failure to pay principal and interest in a
    timely manner and breach of certain covenants.

The obligations of FIS under the FIS Credit Agreement are
    guaranteed by substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of
    FIS (including Metavante and its domestic subsidiaries) and are
    secured by a pledge of the equity interests issued by
    substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of FIS and a
    pledge of 65% of the equity interests issued by certain foreign
    subsidiaries of FIS (other than in each case, Metavante and its
    subsidiaries). The obligations of Metavante under the MV Credit
    Agreement are guaranteed by FIS and substantially all of its
    domestic subsidiaries (including the domestic subsidiaries of
    Metavante) and are secured by a pledge of the equity interests
    issued by (and a security interest in substantially all of the
    assets of) Metavante and the domestic subsidiaries of Metavante.
    The obligations of the SPV under the AR Facility are guaranteed
    by substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of FIS
    (including Metavante and its domestic subsidiaries). The SPV is
    not a guarantor of

the obligations of FIS under the FIS Credit Agreement or of the
    obligations of Metavante under the MV Credit Agreement.

As of December 31, 2009, one financial institution that was
    a lender under one of our credit facilities had failed, thereby
    reducing the amount of revolving capacity available to us under
    our Revolving Loan by an immaterial amount. No other financial
    institutions that are lenders under any of our credit facilities
    have failed to date. We continue to monitor the financial
    stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. The lender
    commitments under the undrawn portions of the Revolving Loan and
    the AR Facility are comprised of a diversified set of financial
    institutions both domestic and international. The combined
    commitments of our top 10 lenders comprise about 67% of our
    Revolving Loan and AR Facility. The failure of any single lender
    to perform their obligations under the Revolving Loan

and/or

the
    AR Facility would not adversely impact our ability to fund
    operations. If the single largest lender were to simultaneously
    default under the terms of both the FIS Credit Agreement
    (impacting the capacity of the Revolving Loan) and the AR
    Facility, the maximum loss of available capacity on the undrawn
    portion of these agreements would be about $117.6 million.
    As of December 31, 2009, the combined undrawn capacity of
    the Revolving Loan and the AR Facility was $703.4 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a
    charge of $12.4 million to write-off unamortized debt
    issuance costs associated with the retirement of Term Loan B in
    conjunction with the LPS spin-off. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, upon entering to the new FIS Credit
    Agreement, we recorded a charge of $27.2 million to
    write-off unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the
    previous FIS term loans and revolver. Total debt issuance costs
    of $6.3 million are capitalized as of December 31,
    2009 related to all of the above credit facilities.

Through the eFunds acquisition on September 12, 2007, we
    assumed $100.0 million in long-term notes payable
    previously issued by eFunds (the “eFunds Notes”). On
    February 26, 2008, we redeemed the eFunds Notes for a total
    of $109.3 million, which included a make-whole premium of
    $9.3 million.

As of December 31, 2009, we have entered into the following

In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, we
    currently pay an applicable margin to our bank lenders on the
    Term Loan A of 0.88%, Term Loan C of 4.25% and the Revolving
    Loan of 0.70% (plus a facility fee of 0.18%) as of
    December 31, 2009.

We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow
    hedges. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings within the Consolidated Statement of
    Equity and Comprehensive Earnings is reclassified into interest
    expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on
    the Term and Revolving Loans. In accordance with the
    authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the inputs
    used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate
    swaps are

Level 2-type

measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit
    risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of
    our interest rate swaps.

As part of the Metavante acquisition, the Company assumed

    fourth quarter the Company settled $10.0 million of these

    $35.1 million. The fair values of the remaining acquired
    swaps were $30.5 million on December 31, 2009.

Approximately $10.0 million of the balance in Accumulated

    into income in 2010.

Our existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there was
    an immaterial impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
    It is our practice to execute such instruments with
    credit-worthy banks at the time of execution and not to enter
    into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
    As of December 31, 2009, we believe that our interest rate
    swap counterparties will be able to fulfill their obligations
    under our agreements and

we believe we will have debt outstanding through the various
    expiration dates of the swaps such that the forecasted
    transactions remain probable of occurring.

Our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of
    derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options,
    to reduce volatility in our results of operations

and/or

cash
    flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Our
    international operations’ revenues and expenses are
    generally denominated in local currency which limits the
    economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those
    jurisdictions. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative
    instruments for trading purposes.

Management believes that based on its historical pattern of
    taxable income, projections of future income, tax planning
    strategies and other relevant evidence, the Company will produce
    sufficient income in the future to realize its deferred income
    tax assets. A valuation allowance is established for any portion
    of a deferred income tax asset if management believes it is more
    likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the
    benefits or portion of a deferred income tax asset. Adjustments
    to the valuation allowance will be made if there is a change in
    management’s assessment of the amount of deferred income
    tax asset that is realizable.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had income
    taxes receivable (payable) of $7.0 million and
    ($1.1) million, respectively.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company has federal,
    state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards resulting in

    operating

losses result in deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009
    and 2008 of $9.7 million and $7.4 million,
    respectively, which expire between 2019 and 2024. The Company
    has a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for state
    net operating loss carryforwards in the amounts of
    $9.0 million and $5.3 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008. The Company has foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards resulting in deferred tax assets at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $62.3 million and
    $53.1 million, respectively. The Company has valuation
    allowances against these net operating losses at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $9.5 million and
    $5.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of
    $15.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively, which
    expire between 2013 and 2025. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the Company has a valuation allowance against
    $2.3 million of foreign tax credits for which the
    Company’s management believes it is more likely than not
    that it will not realize the benefit.

As of January 1, 2005, the IRS selected the Company to
    participate in the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) which is a
    real-time audit for 2005 and future years. The IRS has completed
    its review for years

2002-2007

which resulted in immaterial adjustments for tax years 2004 and
    2007. Currently management believes the ultimate resolution of
    the IRS examinations will not result in a material adverse
    effect to the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations. Substantially all material foreign income tax return
    matters have been concluded through 2002. Substantially all
    state income tax returns have been concluded through 2005.

The Company provides for United States income taxes on earnings
    of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently
    reinvested outside the United States. At December 31, 2009,
    the cumulative earnings on which United States taxes have not
    been provided for were $254.0 million. If these earnings
    were repatriated to the United States, they would generate
    foreign tax credits that could reduce the federal tax liability
    associated with the foreign dividend.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in
    various pending and threatened litigation matters related to
    operations, some of which include claims for punitive or
    exemplary damages. The Company believes that no actions, other
    than the matters listed below, depart from customary litigation
    incidental to its business. As background to the disclosure
    below, please note the following:

•

These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal
    issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities.

•

The Company reviews these matters on an on-going basis and
    follows the authoritative provisions for accounting for
    contingencies when making accrual and disclosure decisions. A
    liability must be accrued if (a) it is probable that an
    asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and
    (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If one
    of these criteria has not been met, disclosure is required when
    there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have
    been incurred. When assessing reasonably possible and probable
    outcomes, the Company bases decisions on the assessment of the
    ultimate outcome following all appeals. Legal fees associated
    with defending these matters are expensed as incurred.

Litigation
    Related to the Metavante Merger

During the second quarter of 2009, a putative class action
    complaint was filed by a purported Metavante shareholder against
    Metavante, its directors, certain officers, and FIS. The
    complaint alleges that the Metavante directors and officers
    breached fiduciary duties to the Metavante shareholders and that
    Metavante and FIS aided and abetted such breaches. The complaint
    sought to enjoin the proposed Merger transaction, preliminarily
    and permanently, and also sought unspecified money damages,
    attorneys’ fees, and class certification. An amended
    complaint was subsequently filed adding an additional plaintiff,
    but it is otherwise the same as the original complaint. The case
    is

Lisa Repinski, et al v. Michael Hayford, et
    al.

, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Case No. 09CV5325.
    A second putative class action containing similar allegations
    was also filed in the second quarter of 2009 by another
    purported Metavante shareholder against Metavante and its
    directors and certain officers. This complaint sought to enjoin
    the Merger transaction, preliminarily and permanently, and also
    seeks unspecified money damages, attorneys’ fees, and class
    certification. The case is

Samuel Beren v. Metavante
    Technologies, Inc. et al.,

Milwaukee County Circuit Court
    Case No. 09CV6315. The two cases were consolidated into a
    single action in the second quarter of 2009 as

In re
    Metavante Technologies, Inc. Shareholder Litigation,

No. 09CV5325. The parties signed a Memorandum of
    Understanding settling the litigation during the third quarter
    of 2009 that is subject to court approval. The settlement was
    not material to the Company. The parties have stayed all
    litigation and the court has executed a protective order to
    permit confirmatory discovery to take place. Preliminary court
    approval was received in the fourth quarter of 2009. Class
    members are being notified of the settlement and given an
    opportunity to object or opt-out of it. After that, the parties
    will seek final approval of the settlement from the court.

McCormick,
    April v. Certegy Payment Recovery Services, Inc., et
    al

This is a putative class action filed in the U.S. District
    Court for the Northern District of Texas against Certegy Check
    Services, Inc. and Certegy Payment Recovery Services, Inc.
    during the first quarter of 2006. The complaint seeks damages
    and declaratory relief for breach of contract as well as alleged
    violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
    (“FDCPA”), Texas Debt Collections Act, and Texas
    Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“TDTPA”). The Plaintiff
    wrote a check to a retailer that was dishonored on presentment.
    The dishonored check was assigned to Certegy for recovery and
    collection of associated service charges. The Plaintiff contends
    that there was no authority to collect a $30 service charge on
    her bounced check, that the collection letters she received were
    misleading and that Certegy’s actions were oppressive.

law would be owed for any bounced check. In addition, the check
    was stamped at the

point-of-sale

with a similar statement that the plaintiff signed. The service
    charge statute in Texas allows a reasonable fee of up to $30 for
    bounced checks. The court dismissed multiple claims arising out
    of the FDCPA, including all claims based on alleged
    misrepresentations or oppressive conduct. The only FDCPA claim
    remaining is Plaintiff’s claim against Certegy Payment
    Recovery Services under Section 808. Certegy filed a motion
    to dismiss the state law claims and a motion for summary
    judgment as to all counts, arguing that Plaintiff expressly
    agreed to pay a service charge if her check bounced. The court
    dismissed the declaratory judgment claim and found that Certegy
    did not make false, deceptive or misleading representations
    under the TDTPA; however, the court declined to dismiss the
    remainder of the state law claims. The Plaintiff filed a motion
    for class certification, and in the first quarter of 2009 the
    court granted that motion with respect to the FDCPA claim
    against Certegy Payment Recovery Services, but denied it with
    respect to all other claims and against all other defendants.
    Certegy Payment Recovery Services appealed the decision to the
    5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The matter was mediated
    during the second quarter of 2009 and a settlement agreement
    regarding all claims was signed and filed with the court for
    approval during the third quarter of 2009. After notice to all
    class members, the court approved the settlement in the first
    quarter of 2010.

Driver’s
    Privacy Protection Act

A putative class action lawsuit styled

Richard Fresco, et
    al. v. Automotive Directions, Inc. et al.

, was filed
    against eFunds and seven other non-related parties in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida
    during the second quarter of 2003. The complaint alleged that
    eFunds purchased motor vehicle records that were used for
    marketing and other purposes that are not permitted under the
    Federal Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (“DPPA”).
    The plaintiffs sought statutory damages, plus costs,
    attorney’s fees and injunctive relief. eFunds and five of
    the other seven defendants settled the case with the plaintiffs.
    That settlement was approved by the court over the objection of
    a group of Texas drivers and motor vehicle record holders. The
    plaintiffs have since moved to amend the court’s order
    approving the settlement in order to seek a greater
    attorneys’ fee award and to recover supplemental costs. In
    the meantime, the objectors filed two class action complaints
    styled

Sharon Taylor, et al. v. Biometric Access Company
    et al. and Sharon Taylor, et al. v. Acxiom et al.

in
    the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
    during the first quarter of 2007 alleging similar violations of
    the DPPA. The Acxiom action was filed against the Company’s
    ChexSystems, Inc. subsidiary, while the Biometric suit was filed
    against the Company’s Certegy Check Services, Inc.
    subsidiary. The judge recused himself in the action against
    Certegy because he was a potential member of the class. The
    lawsuit was then assigned to a new judge and Certegy filed a
    motion to dismiss. The court granted Certegy’s motion to
    dismiss with prejudice in the third quarter of 2008. ChexSystems
    filed a motion to dismiss or stay its action based upon the
    earlier settlement and the Court granted the motion to stay
    pending resolution of the Florida case. The court dismissed the
    ChexSystems’ lawsuit with prejudice against the remaining
    defendants in the third quarter of 2008. The plaintiffs moved
    the court to amend the dismissal to exclude defendants that were
    parties to the Florida settlement. That motion was granted. The
    plaintiffs then appealed the dismissal. The plaintiffs’
    appeals of the dismissals in both lawsuits are pending.

Searcy,
    Gladys v. eFunds Corporation

This is a nationwide putative class action that was originally
    filed against eFunds Corporation and its affiliate Deposit
    Payment Protection Services, Inc. in the U.S. District
    Court for the Northern District of Illinois during the first
    quarter of 2008. The complaint seeks damages for an alleged
    willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act
    (“FCRA”) in connection with the operation of the
    Shared Check Authorization Network. Plaintiff’s principal
    allegation is that consumers did not receive appropriate
    disclosures pursuant to § 1681g of the FCRA because
    the disclosures did not include: (i) all information in the
    consumer’s file at the time of the request; (ii) the
    source of the information in the consumer’s file;

and/or

(iii) the names of any persons who requested information
    related to the consumer’s check writing history during the
    prior year. The Company answered the complaint and is vigorously
    defending the matter. Plaintiff filed a motion for class
    certification which was granted with respect to two subclasses

during the first quarter of 2010. The motion was denied with
    respect to all other subclasses. The Company has filed a motion
    for reconsideration and awaits the court’s ruling on that
    motion.

In re
    Lehman Bros. Holdings et al.

This is an action filed against Metavante Corporation by Lehman
    Brothers Special Financing, Inc., as debtor and debtor in
    possession, together with Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. and its
    affiliated debtors (collectively, “Lehman”) in the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York
    during the second quarter of 2009. The action seeks performance
    under an interest rate swap agreement and enforcement of the
    automatic bankruptcy stay. Lehman alleges that Metavante owed
    through the third quarter of 2009: (a) reset payments
    totaling approximately $11.1 million; and
    (b) $0.7 million in default interest. The bankruptcy
    court ordered Metavante to make these payments, which Metavante
    appealed during the fourth quarter of 2009. Oral argument on
    that appeal will be heard during the first quarter of 2010. See
    Note 3(d) for additional information.

Indemnifications
    and Warranties

The Company often indemnifies its customers against damages and
    costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, or trademark
    infringement associated with use of its software through
    software licensing agreements. Historically, the Company has not
    made any payments under such indemnifications, but continues to
    monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications
    to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and
    would recognize any such losses when they are estimable. In
    addition, the Company warrants to customers that its software
    operates substantially in accordance with the software
    specifications. Historically, no costs have been incurred
    related to software warranties and none are expected in the
    future, and as such no accruals for warranty costs have been
    made.

Leases

The Company leases certain of its property under leases which
    expire at various dates. Several of these agreements include
    escalation clauses and provide for purchases and renewal options
    for periods ranging from one to five years.

Future minimum operating lease payments for leases with
    remaining terms greater than one year for each of the years in
    the five years ending December 31, 2014, and thereafter in
    the aggregate, are as follows (in millions):

In addition, the Company has operating lease commitments

    which renew on a short-term basis.

Rent expense incurred under all operating leases during the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $100.2 million, $117.0 million and
    $108.4 million, respectively. Included in discontinued
    operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was rent
    expense of $0.4 million, $14.5 million and
    $23.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Data Processing and Maintenance Services
    Agreements.

The Company has agreements with
    various vendors, which expire between 2010 and 2019, for
    portions of its computer data processing operations and related
    functions. The Company’s estimated aggregate contractual
    obligation remaining under these agreements was approximately
    $375.5 million as of December 31, 2009. However, this
    amount could be more or less depending on various factors such
    as the inflation rate, foreign exchange rates, the introduction
    of significant new technologies, or changes in the
    Company’s data processing needs.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Stock
    Purchase Plan

FIS employees participate in an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    (ESPP). Eligible employees may voluntarily purchase, at current
    market prices, shares of FIS’ common stock through payroll
    deductions. Pursuant to the ESPP, employees may contribute an
    amount between 3% and 15% of their base salary and certain
    commissions. Shares purchased are allocated to employees based
    upon their contributions. The Company contributes varying
    matching amounts as specified in the ESPP. The Company recorded
    an expense of $12.4 million, $14.3 million and
    $15.2 million, respectively, for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 relating to the
    participation of FIS employees in the ESPP. Included in
    discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings was expense of $0.1 million, $3.0 million and
    $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

401(k)
    Profit Sharing Plan

The Company’s employees are covered by a qualified 401(k)
    plan. Eligible employees may contribute up to 40% of their
    pretax annual compensation, up to the amount allowed pursuant to
    the Internal Revenue Code. The Company generally matches 50% of
    each dollar of employee contribution up to 6% of the
    employee’s total eligible compensation. The Company
    recorded expense of $16.6 million, $18.5 million and
    $20.3 million, respectively, for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 relating to the
    participation of FIS employees in the 401(k) plan. Included in
    discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of
    Earnings was expense of $0.1 million, $3.9 million and
    $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Stock
    Option Plans

In 2005, the Company adopted the FIS 2005 Stock Incentive Plan
    (the “Plan”). As of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    there were 1.8 million and 2.7 million options
    outstanding under this plan, respectively, at a strike price of
    $8.71 per share (as adjusted for the 1.7952 conversion ratio for
    the LPS spin-off and the 0.6396 exchange ratio in the Certegy
    transaction). These stock options were granted at the fair value
    of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The options
    granted under this plan have a term of 10 years and vest
    quarterly over either a 4 or 5 year period (the
    “time-based options”) or based on specific performance
    criteria (the “performance-based options”). The
    performance-based options vested in 2006 after the performance
    criteria were met subsequent to the Certegy Merger.

Through the Certegy Merger, the Company assumed the Certegy Inc.
    Stock Incentive Plan that provides for the issuance of qualified
    and non-qualified stock options to officers and other key
    employees at exercise prices not less than market on the date of
    grant. All options and awards outstanding prior to the Certegy
    Merger under the Certegy Plan were fully vested as of the
    Certegy Merger date. As part of the Certegy Merger, the Certegy
    shareholders approved amendments to the plan and approved an
    additional 6.0 million shares to be made available under
    the plan. The Company granted 0.1 million and
    4.7 million options under this plan in the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. There were
    12.5 million and 14.7 million options outstanding
    under this plan at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

On November 9, 2006, as part of the closing of the FNF
    Merger, the Company assumed certain options and restricted stock
    grants that the Company’s employees and directors held in
    FNF under certain FNF stock option plans. The Company assumed
    2.7 million options to replace approximately
    4.9 million outstanding FNF options per the FNF Merger
    agreement. The Company also assumed 0.1 million shares of
    restricted stock. There were 1.4 million options
    outstanding under these plans at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Certain FIS employees were participants in FNF’s
    stock-based compensation plans prior to the FNF Merger, which
    provide for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock
    options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentive awards
    for officers and key employees. Grants of incentive and
    nonqualified stock options under these plans have generally
    provided that options shall vest equally over three years and
    generally expire ten years after their original date of grant.
    All options granted under these plans have an exercise price
    equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
    date of grant. There were no FNF options granted to FIS
    employees under these plans subsequent to 2006. The Company
    recorded expense relating to these options and restricted stock
    of $1.0 million and $6.4 million in the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. All FNF options
    and restricted stock for which the Company now records expense
    were converted into FIS options and restricted stock in the FNF
    Merger noted above.

On September 12, 2007, as part of the closing of the eFunds
    Acquisition, the Company assumed certain vested and unvested
    options and restricted stock units that the employees of eFunds
    held as of the acquisition date in the eFunds stock option
    plans. The Company assumed 2.2 million options and
    0.1 million restricted stock units.

In 2008, the Company adopted the FIS 2008 Stock Incentive Plan.
    The Company granted 3.3 million and 4.8 million
    options under this plan in the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. There were 7.9 million and
    4.8 million options outstanding and 15.9 million and
    19.2 million options available for grant under this plan as
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS
    spin-off.

All stock options and awards held by
    our employees that became LPS employees were cancelled as of
    that date and reissued as LPS stock options and awards which are
    being accounted for in LPS’ financial results on a
    go-forward basis. All stock options and awards held by employees
    that continued to be FIS employees were adjusted using a
    conversion factor to adjust both the number of awards and the
    strike price of the awards that ensured the fair value of the
    option and award were the same immediately before and after the
    spin-off transaction.

On October 1, 2009, in conjunction with the Metavante
    acquisition, the Company assumed certain vested and unvested
    options and restricted stock awards that the employees of
    Metavante held as of the acquisition date in the Metavante stock
    option plans. The Company assumed 12.2 million options and
    0.6 million restricted stock awards. The Company granted
    2.8 million additional options under this plan subsequent
    to the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2009. There were
    14.3 million options outstanding and 14.4 million
    options available for grant under this plan as of
    December 31, 2009.

Intrinsic value is based on a closing stock price at

The Company has provided for total stock compensation expense of
    $71.0 million, $60.7 million and $39.0 million
    for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, which is included in
    selling, general, and administrative expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings, unless the expense is attributable to a
    discontinued operation. The amount of stock compensation expense
    related to discontinued operations is $9.1 million and
    $14.0 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and has been
    reclassified accordingly.

Stock compensation expense of $19.3 million was recorded
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 relating to the
    acceleration of option vesting for all options and restricted
    stock awards granted under the Certegy plan from
    February 1, 2006 through June of 2008, due to the terms of
    the change in control provisions relating to those awards
    triggered by the acquisition of Metavante. Those awards
    specified that a greater than 33.3% change in ownership of the
    Company would trigger the change in control provisions under
    those agreements and subsequent to the Metavante acquisition,
    FIS shareholders held approximately 52% of the outstanding
    shares of the Company. Stock compensation expense for 2009 also
    includes $8.2 million relating to the acceleration of
    expense relating to certain options and restricted stock awards
    held by certain executives granted in 2008 under the terms of
    their employment agreements. Due to the fact that the terms of
    these awards included these provisions, the acceleration charge
    was based on the original fair value attributable to the awards
    and was not remeasured upon the change in control provision
    being triggered. Stock compensation expense of
    $14.1 million was recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 relating to the acceleration of option
    vesting for all options held by eFunds employees prior to the
    merger and $2.6 million relating to the acceleration upon
    termination of certain executive unvested stock awards. Stock
    compensation expense of $2.2 million was recorded for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 relating to the acceleration
    of option vesting upon termination of certain employees during

    0.2 million shares of our stock for $10.0 million at
    an average price of $40.56 under the Old Plan. During 2007, the
    Company repurchased 1.6 million shares at an average price
    of $49.15 under the Old Plan. (See Note 20 for additional
    information).

On March 20, 2008, we granted 0.4 million shares of
    restricted stock at a price of $38.75 that vest quarterly over
    2 years. On July 2, 2008, 0.2 million of these
    shares were cancelled and assumed by LPS. The remaining unvested
    restricted shares were converted by the conversion factor of
    1.7952. These awards vested as of October 1, 2009 under the
    change in control provisions due to the Metavante acquisition.
    During 2009, we granted 0.5 million shares of restricted
    stock at a price of $22.55 that vest annually over 3 years.
    On October 1, 2009, the Company granted 0.4 million
    restricted stock units at a price of $24.85 per share that vest

    that vest annually over 3 years. As of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, we have approximately 1.4 million and
    1.0 million unvested restricted shares remaining.

Other
    Benefit Plans

Certegy
    Pension Plan

In connection with the Certegy Merger, the Company announced
    that it was going to terminate and settle the Certegy
    U.S. Retirement Income Plan (“USRIP”). The final
    USRIP settlement occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and
    was paid to the participants electing to take a lump-sum payment
    of their accrued benefit or receiving an annuity contract for
    their remaining benefit. The aggregate settlement value was
    $73.5 million. In addition the Company amended the
    Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) to
    effectively freeze the benefits entitled under the plan
    resulting in a curtailment and settlement of that plan at
    December 31, 2007. The liabilities of that plan were then
    paid out in February 2008.

Kordoba
    Pension Plan

Our German operations have unfunded, defined benefit plan
    obligations. These obligations relate to retirement benefits to
    be paid to Kordoba’s employees upon retirement. The
    accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2009 and
    2008 was $30.7 million and $27.7 million,
    respectively, and the projected benefit obligation was
    $31.7 million and $28.6 million, respectively. The
    plan remains unfunded as of December 31, 2009.

Concentration
    of Risk

The Company generates a significant amount of revenue from large
    customers, however, no individual customer accounted for more
    than 5% of total revenue or total segment revenue in the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
    equivalents and trade receivables.

The Company places its cash equivalents with high credit quality
    financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of
    credit exposure with any one financial institution.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
    are limited because a large number of geographically diverse
    customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus
    spreading the trade receivables credit risk. The Company
    controls credit risk through monitoring procedures.

International
    Solutions Group

ISG offers both financial solutions and payment solutions to a
    wide array of international financial institutions. Also, this
    segment includes the Company’s consolidated Brazilian card
    processing venture (see note 7). Included in this segment
    are long-term assets, excluding goodwill and other intangible
    assets, located outside of the United States totaling
    $483.7 million, $398.0 million and $332.1 million
    at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These
    assets are predominantly located in Germany, Brazil, the U.K.
    and India.

Corporate
    and Other

The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate
    overhead costs that are not allocated to operating segments.
    These include costs related to human resources, finance, legal,
    accounting, domestic sales and marketing, merger and acquisition
    activity and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and
    other costs that are not considered when management evaluates
    segment performance.

Subsequent
    Events

The Company has evaluated transactions, events and circumstances
    for consideration of recognition or disclosure through
    February 26, 2010, the date these financial statements were
    issued, and has reflected or disclosed those items within the
    Consolidated Financial Statements as deemed appropriate.

Brazilian
    Venture

During the third quarter of 2008, Banco Santander Spain
    (“Banco Santander”) acquired majority control of ABN.
    Since then, Banco Santander has publicly stated its intention to
    consolidate all Brazilian card processing operations onto its
    own in-house technology platform, and notified the Brazilian
    Venture during 2009 of its desire to exit the relationship. In
    late January 2010, Banco Santander ceased processing its card
    portfolio on the Brazilian Venture’s systems. We are
    presently negotiating Banco Santander’s exit from the
    Brazilian Venture, including an applicable termination payment,
    ongoing call center services, forgiveness of the Brazilian
    Venture Notes, and waiver of our put agreement, which exit must
    be approved by Banco Bradesco.

The Brazilian Venture currently processes approximately
    13.1 million cards for Banco Bradesco and provides call
    center, cardholder support and collection services for all of
    Banco Bradesco’s card portfolios. As a result of the exit
    of Banco Santander from the Brazilian Venture, Banco Bradesco
    has indicated they are analyzing whether these services are best
    provided through the processing joint venture or through a more
    conventional commercial relationship with FIS. We are discussing
    various alternatives with Banco Bradesco and will seek a
    mutually beneficial resolution.

Stock
    Repurchase

On February 4, 2010 our Board of Directors approved a plan
    authorizing repurchases of up to 15.0 million shares of our
    common stock in the open market, at prevailing market prices or
    in privately negotiated transactions through January 31,
    2013. We repurchased 0.6 million shares of our common stock
    for $12.4 million, at an average price of $22.60, from
    February 4, 2010 through February 24, 2010.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

As of the end of the year covered by this report, we carried out
    an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
    of our principal executive officer and principal financial
    officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15

(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
    (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer
    concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
    is: (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
    within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules
    and forms; and (b) accumulated and communicated to
    management, including our principal executive and principal
    financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter
    that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
    Management has adopted the framework in

Internal Control -
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our
    evaluation under this framework, our management concluded that
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
    of December 31, 2009. KPMG LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our
    internal control over financial reporting as set forth in
    Item 8.

    Company intends to file with the Securities and Exchange

    amended, which will include the matters required by these items.
