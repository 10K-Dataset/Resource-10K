PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General
    Development of the Business

FIS is a leading provider of core processing services, card
    issuer and transaction processing and mortgage-related services
    to financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers. FIS
    has processing and technology relationships with 35 of the top
    50 global banks, including nine of the top 10. Over
    50 percent of all U.S. residential mortgages are
    processed using FIS’ mortgage servicing platform. FIS is a
    member of Standard and Poor’s (S&P)

®

Index.

Our business operations and organizational structure result from
    the February 1, 2006, business combination of FIS and
    Certegy (the “Certegy Merger”), pursuant to which FIS
    was merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Certegy.
    Immediately after the Certegy Merger, the stockholders of FIS,
    including its then-majority stockholder Old FNF, owned
    approximately 67.4% of our outstanding common stock.
    Accordingly, for accounting and financial reporting purposes,
    the Certegy Merger was treated as a reverse acquisition of
    Certegy by FIS using the purchase method of accounting pursuant
    to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under
    this accounting treatment, although Certegy was the legal entity
    that survived the merger, FIS was viewed as the acquirer for
    accounting purposes, and our financial statements and other
    disclosures for periods prior to the Certegy Merger treat FIS as
    our predecessor company. Also, as a result of the Certegy
    Merger, the registrant’s name changed from “Certegy
    Inc.” to “Fidelity National Information Services,
    Inc.” and our New York Stock Exchange trading symbol from
    “CEY” to “FIS”. On November 9, 2006,
    Old FNF (after other transactions in which it distributed all of
    its assets other than its ownership in FIS) merged with and into
    FIS (the FNF Merger). Upon completion of the FNF Merger, FIS
    became an independent publicly traded company, and Old FNF
    ceased to exist as an independent publicly traded company. The
    assets distributed by Old FNF prior to the FNF Merger included
    its ownership in Fidelity National Title Group, Inc., which
    following the FNF Merger renamed itself Fidelity National
    Financial, Inc.

Prior to the Certegy Merger, FIS was incorporated under the laws
    of the State of Delaware on May 20, 2004, as a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Old FNF, our former parent company. As a result of
    the Certegy Merger, we are now incorporated under the laws of
    the State of Georgia, where Certegy was initially incorporated
    on March 2, 2001. From November 2004 through March 2005,
    Old FNF contributed a number of business entities to FIS,
    including certain real estate-related information services and
    loan default management businesses developed by Old FNF in the
    1990s, and a series of acquisitions completed by Old FNF between
    2001 and 2005. Although many of these acquisitions added
    important applications and services to the offerings of FIS, our
    long-term growth has been driven primarily by internal growth of
    these businesses and acquisitions of companies that provide core
    processing services to financial institutions including:

•

The financial services division of ALLTEL Information Services,
    Inc., a provider of core banking and mortgage processing
    services;

•

Aurum Technology, a provider of software and outsourcing
    solutions to community banks and credit unions;



•

Kordoba, a provider of information technology solutions for the
    financial services industry with a focus on services and
    solutions for the German banking market;

•

Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc., or Sanchez, a provider of
    software and outsourcing solutions to banks and other financial
    institutions; and

•

InterCept, Inc., or InterCept, a provider of outsourced and
    in-house core banking solutions, as well as item processing and
    check imaging services.

Additionally, since 2006 we have broadened our service offerings
    through our acquisitions of:

•

Certegy, a provider of card issuer services to financial
    institutions and check risk management services in the
    U.S. and internationally, in February 2006; and

•

eFunds Corporation, a provider of risk management services, EFT
    services, prepaid/gift card processing, and global outsourcing
    solutions to financial services companies in the U.S. and
    internationally, in September 2007.

Financial
    Information About Operating Segments and Geographic
    Areas

Our reportable segments are Transaction Processing Services, or
    TPS, and Lender Processing Services, or LPS. The primary
    components of the TPS segment are Integrated Financial
    Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, and International. The primary
    components of the Lender Processing, or LPS segment, are
    Mortgage Processing and Information Services, which includes
    loan facilitation services, default management, and other
    information and outsourcing based services.

Revenue from our TPS segment is generated from serving the
    processing needs of financial institutions. Our primary software
    applications function as the underlying infrastructure of a
    financial institution’s core processing environment which
    banks use to maintain the primary records of their customer
    accounts. We also provide a number of complementary
    applications, such as item processing and electronic funds
    transfer, and services that interact directly with the core
    processing applications, including applications that facilitate
    interactions between our financial institution customers and
    their clients such as online banking and bill payment services
    and fraud prevention and detection services. We offer our
    applications and services through a range of delivery and
    service models, including

on-site

outsourcing and remote processing arrangements, as well as on a
    licensed software basis for installation on customer-owned and
    operated systems. This segment also includes card issuer
    services, which enable banks, credit unions, and others to issue
    VISA and MasterCard credit and debit cards, private label cards,
    and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and
    business accounts. In addition, we provide point-of-sale check
    verification and guarantee services to retailers.

Revenue from our LPS segment is generated from outsourced
    business processes, core mortgage processing and information
    solutions primarily provided to national lenders and loan
    servicers. These processes include centralized title agency and
    closing services offered to first mortgage, refinance, home
    equity and sub-prime lenders. This segment’s information
    solutions include appraisal and valuation services, real estate
    tax services and flood zone information. In addition, this
    segment provides default management services to national lenders
    and loan servicers, allowing customers to outsource the business
    processes necessary to take a loan and the underlying real
    estate securing the loan through the default and foreclosure
    process.

Lender
    Processing Services Spin-off

On October 25, 2007, we announced that our Board of
    Directors had approved pursuing a plan to spin-off the
    businesses that currently make up our LPS segment into a stand
    alone publicly traded company which will be known as Lender
    Processing Services, Inc. (“LPS, Inc.”). As currently
    contemplated, we will contribute the majority of the assets and
    liabilities of this segment into LPS, Inc. in exchange for
    additional shares of the LPS, Inc. common stock and
    approximately $1.6 billion principal amount of LPS, Inc.
    debt securities. Following receipt of necessary approvals from
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and
    a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
    and an opinion from our special tax advisor with respect to the
    tax-free nature of the spin-off, we will distribute 100% of the
    LPS, Inc. common stock to our shareholders in the spin-off and
    exchange the LPS, Inc. debt securities for a like amount of our
    existing debt. We expect that the spin-off will be tax-free to
    FIS and our



shareholders, and that the debt-for-debt exchange will be
    tax-free to FIS. We will then retire the debt that is exchanged
    for the LPS, Inc. debt securities. Completion of the spin-off is
    expected to occur in mid-2008. FIS’s current Chief
    Financial Officer, Jeff Carbiener, is expected to be the Chief
    Executive Officer of LPS, Inc.

In January 2008, we filed a ruling request with the IRS
    regarding the tax-free nature of the LPS, Inc. spin-off and
    intend to file a preliminary Form 10 Registration Statement
    with the SEC in the first quarter of 2008. Completion of the
    spin-off is contingent upon the satisfaction or waiver of a
    variety of conditions, including final approval of the spin-off
    and all related arrangements by our Board of Directors. The
    completion of the proposed spin-off is also subject to risks and
    uncertainties including but not limited to those associated with
    our ability to contribute the LPS segment assets and liabilities
    to LPS, Inc., with the ability of LPS, Inc. to complete the debt
    exchange in the manner and on the terms currently contemplated,
    the possibility that necessary governmental approvals or actions
    (from the IRS, the SEC or other authorities) will not be
    obtained, and market conditions for the spin-off.

Integrated
    Financial Solutions

The primary focus of our Integrated Financial Solutions business
    is to serve the processing needs of independent community banks,
    credit unions, and savings banks in the United States.
    Processing solutions include core processing, branch automation,
    back office support systems, compliance, credit and debit card
    issuing, item processing and imaging, print and mail, ATM/EFT,
    retail Internet banking and bill payment services, commercial
    cash management and voice response services. Over 12,000
    commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions utilize
    one or more of these solutions.

Of these 12,000 institutions, over 1,350 institutions utilize
    one of our core processing solutions. Customers of this segment
    typically seek a fully integrated and broad suite of
    applications. As a result, our core processing services sold in
    this market have various add-on modules or applications that
    integrate into our core processing applications, providing a
    broad processing solution. Examples of our customers in this
    sector include Hudson City Savings Bank, Sterling Bank, and
    VyStar Credit Union.

Over 4,550 institutions utilize our card issuer services which
    enable banks, credit unions, and others to issue VISA and
    MasterCard credit and debit cards, and other electronic payment
    cards for use by both consumer and business accounts. The
    majority of our card issuer programs are full service, including
    most of the operations and support necessary for an issuer to
    operate a credit and debit card program. We do not make credit
    decisions for our



card issuing customers, nor do we fund their card receivables.
    We provide our card issuer services primarily through our
    longstanding contractual alliances with two associations
    representing independent community banks and credit unions in
    the U.S., the Independent Community Bankers of America, or ICBA,
    and Card Services for Credit Unions, or CSCU. These
    organizations offer our services to their respective members
    with our company as the provider. Our alliances with the ICBA
    and CSCU provide us with an efficient and effective means of
    marketing our services to individual credit unions and community
    banks.

Our item processing and imaging services are utilized by more
    than 1,450 institutions. The services provide our customers with
    a wide range of outsourcing services relating to the imaging and
    processing of checks, statements, remittances, and other
    transaction records, which are performed at one of our 40 item
    processing centers located throughout the U.S. or

on-site

at a
    customer location.

We provide a full range of ePayment capabilities, including
    electronic funds transfer, or EFT, processing solutions, ranging
    from automated teller machine, or ATM, and debit card services
    to card production and distribution to stored-value prepaid/gift
    cards and payroll cards. Our eBanking services are utilized by
    more than 1,660 financial institutions and enable them to offer
    Internet banking and bill payment services to consumers and
    businesses.

Enterprise
    Solutions

Our Enterprise Solutions division focuses on serving the
    processing needs of large U.S. financial institutions,
    automotive financing companies, and commercial lenders. We also
    provide check risk management and related processing services to
    businesses accepting or cashing checks at the point-of-sale,
    risk management services to financial institutions and
    comprehensive cash access services in the gaming industry.
    Primary service offerings include:

    branch and teller environments, and retail and commercial
    Internet channels.

•

Integration Applications for Financial
    Institutions.

Our integration applications access
    data across both our internal and third-party core processing
    systems and transport information to our customers’ retail

    facilitate tightly integrated systems and efficient software
    delivery that reduces technology costs for our customers.

•

Syndicated Loan Applications.

Our syndicated
    loan applications are designed to support wholesale and
    commercial banking requirements necessary for all aspects of
    syndicated commercial loan origination and management.

•

    applications include an application suite that assists
    automotive finance institutions in evaluating loan applications
    and credit risk, and allows automotive finance institutions to
    manage their loan and lease portfolios.

•

Risk Management Services for Financial Institutions and
    Retailers.

Our risk management services utilize
    our proprietary risk management services and data sources to
    assist in detecting fraud and assessing the risk of opening a
    new account or accepting a check at either the point-of-sale, a
    physical branch location, or through the Internet.

The processing needs of our customers vary significantly across
    the sizes and types of entities we serve. These entities include:

•

Large Financial Institutions.

We define the
    large financial institution market as banks and other financial
    institutions in North America with assets in excess of
    $5 billion. Of the 100 largest U.S. banks as of
    December 31, 2007, our customers included 8 banks that use
    our real-time, integrated loan and deposit applications, 21
    banks that use our deposit-related core processing applications,
    40 banks that use our lending-related core processing
    applications and 17 banks that use our various retail delivery
    applications. Our customers in this market include JP Morgan
    Chase, Bank of America, ING/Direct and Charles Schwab Bank.

•

Automotive Finance Institutions.

Our
    automotive finance processing services include integrated loan
    and lease servicing solutions for the global automotive finance

    automotive loans and leases in North America and Europe were
    processed on our automotive finance applications. We also offer
    dealer wholesale finance and other ancillary services to the
    automotive finance industry. Three of the top five captive
    automotive finance companies in the U.S., as ranked at the end
    of 2006, utilize our applications and services.

    Electric, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Barclays Capital, Bank

•

Retailers.

A significant portion of our

    large national retail chains including Sears, Best Buy, Marmaxx
    and Albertson’s. Other customers of our check risk
    management services include regional merchants such as hotels,
    automotive dealers, telecommunication companies, supermarkets,
    gaming establishments, mail order houses and other businesses.

We have developed several models of providing our customers with
    applications and services. We typically deliver the highest
    value to our customers when we combine our software applications
    and deliver them in one of several types of outsourcing
    arrangements, such as an application service provider,
    facilities management processing or application management
    arrangement. We are also able to deliver individual applications
    through a software licensing arrangement. Finally, using our
    expertise gained in the foregoing types of arrangements, we also
    have clients for whom we manage their IT operations, without
    providing any of our proprietary software.

    services, and check risk management solutions to financial
    institutions, card issuers, and retailers in approximately 80

Mortgage
    Processing

We offer the most widely used mortgage loan servicing system
    (known as MSP) in the U.S. As of December 31, 2007,
    our mortgage loan servicing platform, or MSP, was used to
    process over 50% of all residential mortgages, based on number
    of loans, in the U.S. Our mortgage loan processing
    customers include Bank of America, Wells Fargo, National City
    Mortgage, and U.S. Bank Home Mortgage. Our customer
    relationships are typically long-term relationships that provide
    consistent annual revenues based on the number of mortgages
    processed on our platform.

While our mortgage servicing applications can be purchased on a
    stand-alone, licensed basis, the substantial majority of our MSP
    customers by both number of customers and number of loans choose
    to use us as their processing partner and engage us to perform
    all data processing functions in our technology center located
    in Jacksonville, Florida. Customers determine whether to process
    their loan portfolio data under an application service provider
    arrangement in which multiple clients share the same computing
    and personnel resources or to have their own dedicated resources
    within our facility.

The primary applications and services of this business include:

•

MSP.

Our Mortgage Servicing Platform, or

MSP

, is an application that automates loan servicing,
    including loan setup and ongoing processing, customer service,
    accounting and reporting to the secondary mortgage market, and
    federal regulatory reporting. MSP serves as the core application
    through which our bank customers keep the primary records of
    their mortgage loans, and as a result is an important part of
    the bank’s underlying processing infrastructure. MSP
    processes a wide range of loan products, including fixed-rate
    mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages, construction loans, equity
    lines of credit and daily simple interest loans.

•

Empower.

Empower is a mortgage loan
    origination software system used by banks, savings &
    loans, mortgage bankers and sub-prime lenders. This application
    automates making loans, providing seamless credit bureau access
    and interfacing with MSP, automated underwriting systems used by
    Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and with vendors providing servicing,
    flood certifications, appraisals and title insurance.

Information
    Outsourcing

We offer a suite of services spanning the entire mortgage loan
    life cycle, from loan origination through closing, refinancing,
    foreclosure and resale. A significant number of our customers
    use a combination of our mortgage servicing, mortgage
    information, mortgage origination and default management
    services. Our client base includes mortgage lenders such as
    U.S. Bancorp, Bank of America, Freddie Mac and Washington
    Mutual, as well as investors and real estate professionals. Our
    primary service lines are described below:

•

Valuation and Appraisal Services.

We provide a
    broad suite of valuation applications, which include automated
    valuation models, traditional appraisals, broker price opinions,
    collateral scores and appraisal reviews.

•

Mortgage Origination Services.

We provide
    centralized title and closing services to financial institutions
    in the first mortgage, refinance, home equity and sub-prime
    lending markets. Our client base includes Wells Fargo,
    Washington Mutual, and Bank of America. Our centralized
    financial institution title agency services include arranging
    for the issuance of a title insurance policy by a title insurer.
    We offer these services on a national basis, both in the
    traditional manner and through our centralized production
    facilities that



incorporate automated processes, which can help expedite the
    delivery of services. Our closing management services cover a
    variety of types of closings, including purchases and
    refinancings, and provide a variety of types of services. We
    maintain a network of independent closing agents who are trained
    to close loans in accordance with the lender’s instructions.

•

Default Management Services.

We primarily
    provide our default management services to national mortgage
    lenders and loan servicers, many of which previously performed
    this function in-house. We currently provide default management
    services to 19 of the top 25 residential mortgage servicers, 14
    of the top 25 sub-prime servicers, and 6 of the top 25
    subservicers. Our default management services enable mortgage
    lenders and loan servicers to outsource the business processes
    necessary to take a loan and the underlying real estate securing
    the loan through the default and foreclosure process. We work
    with customers to identify specific parameters regarding the
    type and quality of services they require and provide a single
    point of contact for these services. As a result, our customers
    are able to use our outsourcing services in a manner that we
    believe provides a greater level of consistency in services,
    pricing, and quality than if these customers were to obtain
    these services from separate providers. We use our own resources
    and networks that we have established with independent
    contractors to provide these default management outsourcing
    solutions. Within our default management services we are now
    utilizing our proprietary Desktop System, a workflow information
    system that can be used for managing a range of different
    workflow processes. The Desktop System improves efficiency by
    streamlining complex work processes and reducing manual effort
    required to process files. It can be used to organize images of
    paper documents within a particular file, to capture information
    from imaged documents, to manage invoices and to provide
    multiple constituencies with access to key data needed for
    process management. The Desktop System serves as a core
    application for tracking all stages of the default management
    process.

•

1031 Exchange Intermediary Services.

We act as
    a qualified exchange intermediary for those customers who seek
    to engage in qualified exchanges under Section 1031 of the
    Internal Revenue Code, which allows capital gains tax deferral
    on the sale of certain investment assets.

•

Real Estate Tax Services.

We offer lenders a
    monitoring service that will notify them of any change in tax
    status during the life of a loan. We also provide complete
    outsourcing of tax escrow services, including the establishment
    of a tax escrow account that is integrated with the
    lender’s mortgage servicing system and the processing of
    tax payments to taxing authorities.

•

Flood Zone Certifications.

We offer flood zone
    certifications through a proprietary automated system that
    accesses and interprets Federal Emergency Management Agency, or

FEMA

, flood maps and certifies whether a property is in a
    federally designated flood zone. Additionally, we offer lenders
    a life-of-loan flood zone determination service that monitors
    previously issued certificates for any changes, such as FEMA
    flood map revisions, for as long as that loan is outstanding.

•

Data and Analytics.

We offer data and
    analytics services including enhanced property records
    information and alternative valuation services.

Sales and
    Marketing

Sales
    Force

We have teams of experienced sales personnel with subject matter
    expertise in particular services or in the needs of particular
    types of customers. A significant portion of our potential
    customers in each of our business lines is targeted via direct

and/or

indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound
    telemarketing efforts. Marketing activities include direct
    marketing, print advertising, media relations, public relations,
    tradeshow and convention activities, seminars, and other
    targeted activities. Because many of our customers use a single
    service, or a combination of services, our direct sales force
    also targets existing customers to promote cross-selling
    opportunities. Our strategy is to use the most efficient
    delivery system available to successfully acquire customers and
    build awareness of our services.

In our Lender Processing Segment, in addition to our traditional
    sales force, we have established a core team of senior managers
    to lead strategic account management for the full range of our
    services to existing and potential top-



tier financial institution customers. The individuals who
    participate in this effort, which we coordinate through our
    Office of the Enterprise, spend a significant amount of their
    time on sales and marketing efforts as well as working with our
    business units to develop solutions based upon strategic issues
    impacting customers’ businesses.

Patents,
    Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal
    security practices, and copyright and trade secret law to
    establish and protect our software, technology, and expertise.
    Further, we have developed a number of brands that have
    accumulated substantial goodwill in the marketplace, and we rely
    on trademark law to protect our rights in that area. We intend
    to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary
    to protect our copyright, trade secret, and trademark rights.
    These legal protections and arrangements afford only limited
    protection of our proprietary rights, and there is no assurance
    that our competitors will not independently develop or license
    products, services, or capabilities that are substantially
    equivalent or superior to ours. In general, we believe that we
    own most proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our
    business, although we do license certain items, none of which is
    material, under arms-length agreements for varying terms.

Competition

Our primary competitors include internal technology departments
    within banks, data processing or software development
    departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers,
    third-party payment processors, independent computer services
    firms, companies that develop and deploy software applications,
    companies that provide customized development, implementation
    and support services, and companies that market software for the
    electronic payment industry. Some of these competitors possess
    substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources
    than we do. Competitive factors for applications and services
    include the quality of the technology-based application or
    service, application features and functions, ease of delivery
    and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance,
    and support the applications or services, and price. We believe
    that we compete favorably in each of these categories. In
    addition, we believe that our financial institution industry
    expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple
    applications, services and integrated solutions to individual
    customers, enhances our competitiveness against competitors with
    more limited application offerings.

We compete with vendors that offer similar core processing
    applications and services to financial institutions, including
    Fiserv, Inc., Jack Henry and Associates, Inc., Metavante
    Corporation, Open Solutions, IBM and Accenture. In certain

non-U.S. markets,

we compete with regional providers including Alnova, I-Flex, and
    Temenos.

Our competitors in the card issuer services market include
    third-party credit and debit card processors such as First Data
    Corporation, Total System Services, Electronic Data Systems
    Corporation, and Payment Systems for Credit Unions, and
    third-party software providers, which license their card
    processing systems to financial institutions and third-party
    processors. Competitors in the check risk management services
    market include First Data’s TeleCheck Services division,
    CrossCheck, and Global Payments.

The markets for our Information Outsourcing business lines are
    also highly competitive. Key competitive factors include quality
    of the service, convenience, speed of delivery, customer
    service, and price. We do not believe that there is a competitor
    currently offering the scope of services and market coverage
    that we provide in our Information Outsourcing business.
    However, there are a number of competitors in specific lines,
    some of which have substantial resources. First American and
    Land America are significant competitors in a majority of our
    Information Outsourcing business lines, including tax, flood,
    appraisal and default.

Research
    and Development

Our research and development activities have related primarily
    to the design and development of our processing systems and
    related software applications and risk management platforms. We
    expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate
    level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the
    functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software
    applications, to develop new and innovative software
    applications and systems in response to the needs of our
    customers, and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our
    outsourcing infrastructure. In addition, we intend to offer
    services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery
    channels.



As part of our research and development process, we evaluate
    current and emerging technology for applicability to our
    existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage
    with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of
    various infrastructure components. Where appropriate, we use
    third-party technology components in the development of our
    software applications and service offerings. Third-party
    software may be used for highly specialized business functions,
    which we may not be able to develop internally within time and
    budget constraints. Additionally, third-party software may be
    used for commodity type functions within a technology platform
    environment. In the case of nearly all of our third-party
    software, enterprise license agreements exist for the
    third-party component and either alternative suppliers exist or
    transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply. As a
    result, we are not materially dependent upon any third-party
    technology components. We work with our customers to determine
    the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or
    infrastructure changes to our applications and services. In the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 we recorded
    expense of approximately $106.3 million,
    $105.6 million, and $113.5 million, respectively, on
    research and development efforts (excluding amounts capitalized).

Government
    Regulation

Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal, state,
    and foreign regulation. Our failure to comply with any
    applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on
    our ability to provide our services, as well as the imposition
    of civil fines and criminal penalties.

As a provider of electronic data processing and back-office
    services to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and
    credit unions we are subject to regulatory oversight and
    examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
    Council, an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the
    Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration
    and various state regulatory authorities. In addition,
    independent auditors annually review several of our operations
    to provide reports on internal controls for our customers’
    auditors and regulators. We also may be subject to possible
    review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in
    which we conduct our electronic processing activities.

Beginning July 1, 2001, financial institutions were
    required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These regulations place restrictions on
    financial institutions’ use of non-public personal
    information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed
    privacy policies to their customers and offer them the
    opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share
    information with third parties. The new regulations, however,
    permit financial institutions to share information with
    non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial
    institutions. As a provider of services to financial
    institutions, we are required to comply with the privacy
    regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure
    of the information received from our customers as apply to the
    financial institutions themselves.

Given that one of the databases that we maintain in the
    U.S. contains certain data pertaining to the check-writing
    histories of consumers, and that data is used to provide certain
    check risk management services, our check risk management
    business is subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and
    various similar state laws. Among other things, the Fair Credit
    Reporting Act imposes requirements on us concerning data
    accuracy, and provides that consumers have the right to know the
    contents of their check-writing histories, to dispute their
    accuracy, and to require verification or removal of disputed
    information. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy,
    fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers’
    personal information, and compliance with these laws, we
    maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in
    which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations
    call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer
    requests for information and handling of disputes.

Our check collection services are subject to the Federal Fair
    Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws
    and licensing requirements. The Federal Trade Commission, as
    well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have
    enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as
    the various credit reporting laws.

Elements of our cash access business are registered as a Money
    Services Business and are subject to the USA Patriot Act and
    reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and
    U.S. Treasury Regulations. This business is also



subject to various state, local and tribal licensing
    requirements. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state
    attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement
    responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency
    transmission, and licensing.

The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, and related
    regulations generally prohibit the payment or receipt of fees or
    any other item of value for the referral of a real
    estate-secured loan to a loan broker or lender and prohibit fee
    shares or splits of unearned fees in connection with the
    provision of residential real estate settlement services, such
    as mortgage brokerage and real estate brokerage. Notwithstanding
    these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished
    or for services actually performed, so long as those payments
    bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods
    or services provided. RESPA and related regulations may to some
    extent restrict our real estate-related businesses from entering
    into certain preferred alliance arrangements. The
    U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is
    responsible for enforcing RESPA.

Real estate appraisers are subject to regulation in most states,
    and some state appraisal boards have sought to prohibit certain
    valuation products including our automated valuation
    applications. Courts have limited such prohibitions, in part on
    the ground of preemption by the federal Financial Institutions
    Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, but we cannot
    assure you that our valuation and appraisal services business
    will not be subject to regulation.

The title agency and related services we provide are conducted
    through an underwritten title company, title agencies, and
    individual title agents and escrow officers. The regulation of
    an underwritten title company is generally limited to
    requirements to maintain specified levels of net worth and
    working capital, and to obtain and maintain appropriate licenses
    for the jurisdictions in which it operates. The title agencies
    and individual escrow officers are also subject to regulation by
    the insurance or banking regulators in many jurisdictions. These
    regulators generally require, among other items, that agents and
    individuals obtain and maintain a license and be appointed by a
    title insurer. We also own a small title insurer which issues
    policies generated by our direct and agency operations in
    relatively limited circumstances. This insurer is domiciled in
    New York and is therefore subject to regulation by the insurance
    regulatory authorities of that state. Among other things, no
    person may acquire 10% or more of our common stock without the
    approval of the New York insurance regulators.

The California Department of Insurance has recently proposed
    implementing rate reductions in the title insurance industry in
    California. Florida, New Mexico, and Texas have also announced
    reviews of title insurance rates and other states could follow.
    At this stage, we are unable to predict what the outcome will be
    of these or any similar processes. Any such rate reductions
    could adversely affect our revenues from our title agency
    services.

Given that we conduct business in international markets as well
    as in the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations in
    jurisdictions outside the U.S. that regulate many of the
    same activities that are described above, including electronic
    data processing and back-office services for financial
    institutions and use of consumer information.

The IRS has proposed regulations under Section 468B
    regarding the taxation of the income earned on escrow accounts,
    trusts and other funds used during deferred exchanges of
    like-kind property and under Section 7872 regarding
    below-market loans to facilitators of these exchanges. The
    proposed regulations affect taxpayers that engage in like-kind
    exchanges and escrow holders, trustees, qualified
    intermediaries, and others that hold funds during like-kind
    exchanges. We currently do not know what effect these changes
    will have on our 1031 exchange businesses.

Although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and
    regulations related to our businesses, including future consumer
    protection laws and regulations, will have a material adverse
    effect on our company, enactment of new laws and regulations may
    increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly or
    indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory
    compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity,

and/or

loss
    of revenue.



Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    31,000 employees, including approximately
    12,000 employees principally employed outside of the
    U.S. None of our U.S. workforce currently is
    unionized. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we
    consider our relations with employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to
    significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed
    below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant
    adverse effect on our results of operation and financial
    condition.

If we
    fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the
    marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology
    are not successful, we could lose customers and have difficulty
    attracting new customers for our services.

The markets for our services are characterized by constant
    technological changes, frequent introductions of new services
    and evolving industry standards. Our future success will be
    significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current
    services, and develop and introduce new services that address
    the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their
    clients. These initiatives carry the risks associated with any
    new service development effort, including cost overruns, delays
    in delivery, and performance issues. There can be no assurance
    that we will be successful in developing, marketing and selling
    new services that meet these changing demands, that we will not
    experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the
    successful development, introduction, and marketing of these
    services, or that our new services and their enhancements will
    adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve
    market acceptance.

We
    operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are
    unable to compete effectively our results of operations and
    financial condition may be adversely affected.

The market for our services is intensely competitive. Our
    competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the
    services they offer. Some of our competitors have substantial
    resources. We face direct competition from third parties, and
    since many of our larger potential customers have historically
    developed their key applications in-house and therefore view
    their system requirements from a make-versus-buy perspective, we
    often compete against our potential customers’ in-house
    capacities. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we
    compete will continue to attract new competitors and new
    technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    compete successfully against current or future competitors or
    that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we
    operate will not materially adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.



Our
    substantial leverage and debt service requirements may adversely
    affect our financial and operational flexibility.

As of December 31, 2007, we had total debt of approximately
    $4.3 billion. This high level of debt could have important
    consequences to us, including the following:

•

the debt level makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns
    and adverse developments in our business, may cause us to have
    difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital,
    capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes and limits
    our ability to pursue other business opportunities and implement
    certain business strategies;

•

we need to use a large portion of the money we earn to pay
    principal and interest on our senior credit facilities, which
    reduces the amount of money available to finance operations,
    acquisitions and other business activities, repay other
    indebtedness and pay shareholder dividends;

•

some of the debt has a variable rate of interest, which exposes
    us to the risk of increased interest rates; and

•

we have a higher level of debt than certain of our competitors,
    which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce
    flexibility in responding to changing business and economic
    conditions, including increased competition.

In addition, the terms of our senior credit facilities may
    restrict us from taking actions, such as making significant
    acquisitions or dispositions or entering into certain
    agreements, which we might believe to be advantageous to us.

If we
    are unable to successfully consummate and integrate
    acquisitions, our results of operations may be adversely
    affected.

As part of our growth strategy, we have made numerous
    acquisitions in recent years. We anticipate that we will
    continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses and
    services. This strategy will depend on the ability to find
    suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms. We
    may require additional debt or equity financing for future
    acquisitions, and doing so will be made more difficult by our
    substantial debt. If we are unable to acquire suitable
    acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth.

Further, even if we successfully complete acquisitions, we will
    face challenges in integrating any acquired business. These
    challenges include eliminating redundant operations, facilities
    and systems, coordinating management and personnel, retaining
    key employees, managing different corporate cultures, and
    achieving cost reductions and cross-selling opportunities. There
    can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all
    aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the
    potential benefits of bringing them together, and the process of
    integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and
    divert our resources.

Consolidation
    in the banking and financial services industry could adversely
    affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and
    potential customers and could make us more dependent on a more
    limited number of customers.

There has been and continues to be substantial merger,
    acquisition and consolidation activity in the banking and
    financial services industry. Mergers or consolidations of banks
    and financial institutions in the future could reduce the number
    of our customers and potential customers, which could adversely
    affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the
    aggregate number of customers or the banking and other
    activities of the consolidated entities. If our customers merge
    with or are acquired by other entities that are not our
    customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may
    discontinue or reduce their use of our services. In addition, it
    is possible that the larger banks or financial institutions
    resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform
    in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide
    or could provide. Any of these developments could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.



Demand
    for many of our services is sensitive to the level of consumer
    transactions generated by our customers, and accordingly, our
    revenues could be impacted negatively by a general economic
    slowdown or any other event causing a material slowing of
    consumer spending.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction
    processing fees. Any changes in economic factors that adversely
    affect consumer spending and related consumer debt, or a
    reduction in check writing or credit and debit card usage, could
    reduce the volume of transactions that we process, and have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Potential
    customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor, which may
    adversely affect our growth, both in the U.S. and
    internationally.

For banks and other potential customers of our financial
    information software and services, switching from one vendor of
    bank core processing or related software and services (or from
    an internally-developed system) to a new vendor is a significant
    undertaking. Many potential customers worry about potential
    disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality,
    increased costs and business disruption. As a result, potential
    customers, both in the U.S. and internationally, often
    resist change. We seek to overcome this resistance through
    strategies such as making investments to enhance the
    functionality of our software. However, there can be no
    assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential
    customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful,
    and this resistance may adversely affect our growth, both in the
    U.S. and internationally.

Decreased
    lending and real estate activity may reduce demand for certain
    of our services and adversely affect our results of
    operations.

Real estate sales are affected by a number of factors, including
    mortgage interest rates, the availability of funds to finance
    purchases, the level of home prices and general economic
    conditions. The volume of refinancing transactions in particular
    and mortgage originations in general declined in 2005, 2006 and
    2007 from 2004 levels, resulting in reduction of revenues in
    some of our businesses. The current MBA forecast is for $2.0
    trillion of mortgage originations in 2008 compared to $2.3
    trillion in 2007. Our revenues in future periods will continue
    to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond our
    control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate.

Further, in the event that levels of home ownership were to
    decline or other factors were to reduce the aggregate number of
    U.S. mortgage loans, our revenues from mortgage processing
    and related services could be adversely affected.

We
    could have conflicts with FNF, and the executive chairman of our
    board of directors and other officers and directors could have
    conflicts of interest due to their relationships with
    FNF.

Conflicts may arise between FNF and us as a result of our
    ongoing agreements and the nature of our respective businesses.
    Among other things, we and certain of our subsidiaries are
    parties to a variety of related party agreements with FNF.
    Certain of our executive officers and directors will be subject
    to conflicts of interest with respect to such related party
    agreements and other matters due to their relationships with FNF.

Some of the FNF executive officers and directors who became
    executive officers and directors of our company in connection
    with the FNF Merger, including William P. Foley, II and
    Brent B. Bickett, own substantial amounts of FNF stock and stock
    options because of their relationships with FNF and Old FNF
    prior to the FNF Merger. Such ownership could create or appear
    to create potential conflicts of interest when our directors and
    officers are faced with decisions that involve FNF or any of its
    respective subsidiaries.

Mr. Foley, who became our Executive Chairman in connection
    with the FNF Merger, is currently the Chairman of the board of
    directors of FNF. Mr. Bickett also became an officer of our
    company and FNF. As a result, each of these individuals has
    obligations to us as well as to FNF and will have conflicts of
    interest with respect to matters potentially or actually
    involving or affecting us and FNF.



Matters that could give rise to conflicts between us and FNF
    include, among other things.

•

our past and ongoing relationships with FNF, including related
    party agreements and other arrangements with respect to the
    administration of tax matters, employee benefits,
    indemnification, and other matters;

•

the quality and pricing of services that we have agreed to
    provide to FNF or that it has agreed to provide to us; and

•

business opportunities arising for either us or FNF, that could
    be pursued by either us or by FNF.

We will seek to manage these potential conflicts through dispute
    resolution and other provisions of our agreements with FNF and
    through oversight by independent members of our board of
    directors. However, there can be no assurance that such measures
    will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all
    potential conflicts with FNF, or that the resolution of any such
    conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were
    dealing with an unaffiliated third party.

We may
    lack adequate oversight since the chairman of the board of
    directors of FNF is also our executive chairman.

Mr. Foley is executive chairman of our board of directors.
    Mr. Foley is also the chairman of the board of directors of
    FNF. As a result of his roles, he has obligations to us as well
    as FNF and may have conflicts of time with respect to matters
    potentially or actually involving or affecting us. As executive
    chairman, it is expected that Mr. Foley will devote no more
    than one-half of his time to matters relating to us. If
    Mr. Foley’s duties as executive chairman of our board
    of directors require more time than he is able to allot, then
    his oversight of the activities of our company could be
    diminished and the effective management of our company could be
    adversely affected.

Our
    revenues from the sale of services to the VISA and MasterCard
    organizations are dependent upon our continued VISA and
    MasterCard certification and financial institution sponsorship,
    and the loss or suspension of this certification or sponsorship
    could adversely affect our business.

In order to provide our card services, we must be designated a
    certified processor by, and be a member service provider of,
    MasterCard and be designated as an independent sales
    organization of VISA. These designations are dependent upon our
    continuing adherence to the standards of the VISA and MasterCard
    associations. The member financial institutions of VISA and
    MasterCard, some of which are our competitors, set the standards
    with which we must comply. If we fail to comply with these
    standards, our designation as a certified processor, as a member
    service provider, or as an independent sales organization could
    be suspended or terminated. The termination of our member
    service provider status or our status as a certified processor,
    or any changes in the VISA and MasterCard rules that prevent our
    registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide
    transaction processing and marketing services for the VISA or
    MasterCard organizations, would result in the loss of business
    from VISA or MasterCard issuing customers, and lead to a
    reduction in our revenues, which in turn could have a material
    adverse effect on our business.

We
    have a long sales cycle for many of our applications and if we
    fail to close sales after expending significant time and
    resources to do so, our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

The implementation of many of our applications often involves
    significant capital commitments by our customers, particularly
    those with smaller operational scale. Potential customers
    generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of
    available software and require us to expend substantial time,
    effort, and money educating them as to the value of our software
    and services. We incur substantial costs in order to obtain each
    new customer. We may expend significant funds and management
    resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close
    the sale. Our sales cycle may be extended due to our
    customers’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons. If
    we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant
    funds and management resources or we experience delays, it could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations.



In the
    wake of the current mortgage crisis, there could be adverse
    regulatory consequences or litigation that could affect
    us.

Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal, state
    and foreign regulation. The sharp rise in home foreclosures that
    started in the United States during the fall of 2006 and has
    accelerated in 2007 and 2008 has begun to result in
    investigations and lawsuits against various parties commenced by
    various governmental authorities and third parties. It has also
    resulted in governmental review of aspects of the mortgage
    lending business, which may lead to greater regulation in areas
    such as appraisals, default management, loan closings and
    regulatory reporting. Such actions and proceedings could have
    consequences that could adversely affect our business.

Completion
    of the spin-off is subject to various risks.

On October 25, 2007, we announced our intention to pursue
    the spin-off of the businesses that primarily comprise our LPS
    operations. There is no guarantee the proposed spin-off will be
    finalized. Completion of the spin-off is subject to a number of
    specific factors and conditions, as well as to the discretion of
    our board of directors which may be influenced by market
    conditions or other factors. For example, it is a condition to
    completing the spin-off that we receive a private letter ruling
    from the IRS and an opinion of our special tax adviser, together
    to the effect that, for United States Federal income tax
    purposes, the following transactions will qualify as tax-free
    transactions to us, the spun-off entity, and our stockholders:
    (i) the contribution of all of our interest in the assets,
    liabilities, businesses and employees related to our LPS
    operations in exchange for the receipt by us of LPS, Inc. common
    stock and LPS, Inc. debt obligations (the
    “contribution”); (ii) the expected exchange by us
    of the LPS, Inc. debt obligations for certain of our outstanding
    debt (the “debt exchange”); and (iii) the
    distribution of LPS, Inc. common stock to our stockholders,
    except that any gain that our stockholders realize on cash
    received in lieu of any fractional shares of LPS, Inc. common
    stock to which such stockholders may be entitled in the
    distribution generally will be taxable to the stockholders. The
    proposed spin-off is also subject to the SEC having declared
    effective the registration statement for the new shares and the
    listing of LPS, Inc. common stock on the NYSE having been
    approved, among other conditions.

If the spin-off is not completed, we will have incurred costs
    without any corresponding benefit. Further, our management will
    have spent time executing the plan which may be a distraction
    from its day to day activities.

We
    and/or LPS may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits
    that we expect will be achieved from the spin-off.

We and LPS, Inc. may not be able to achieve the full strategic
    and financial benefits we expect will result from the spin-off
    or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. These
    outcomes may occur due to, among other things, the leverage to
    be incurred by LPS, Inc. in connection with the spin-off, the
    loss of synergies, excess costs the two companies will incur as
    stand-alone entities, or the obligations imposed on LPS, Inc.
    and us to avoid certain transactions in respect of our capital
    stock in order to preserve the planned tax-free nature of the
    transactions.

Finally, notwithstanding our receipt of the IRS private letter
    ruling and opinion of our special tax adviser, the IRS could
    determine that the contribution, debt exchange

and/or

spin-off should be treated as taxable transactions if it
    determines that there was a misstatement or omission of any of
    the facts, representations, or undertakings that were included
    in the request for the private letter ruling, or if it disagrees
    with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the
    IRS ruling. In such case, we and our shareholders could be
    subject to significant tax liabilities.

If Old
    FNF’s 2006 spin-off of FNF does not constitute a tax free
    distribution under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue
    Code or if our merger with Old FNF does not constitute a tax
    free reorganization under Section 368(a), then we may
    suffer losses resulting from payment of taxes and tax-related
    losses.

Under a tax disaffiliation agreement, which we were required to
    enter into with Old FNF and FNF as a condition to the closing
    under our merger agreement with Old FNF, FNF is required to
    indemnify us for taxes and tax-related losses (including
    stockholder suits) if Old FNF’s 2006 spin-off of FNF (the
    “2006 Distribution”) were determined to be taxable
    either to Old FNF (and us as its successor) or the FNF
    stockholders or both, unless such adverse determination were the
    result of a breach by us of our agreement not to take any action
    within our control that would cause the 2006 Distribution to be
    taxable or the result of an acquisition of FIS stock within the
    control of



us or a subsidiary. In such an event, Old FNF estimated that the
    amount of tax on the transfer of FNF’s stock in the
    distribution could be in the range of $150 million and
    possibly greater depending on, among other things, the value of
    FNF’s stock at the time of the 2006 Distribution. In
    addition, FNF is required under the tax disaffiliation agreement
    to indemnify Old FNF (and us as its successor) for taxes and
    tax-related losses (including stockholder suits) in the event
    the Old FNF-FIS merger were determined to be taxable. Old FNF
    estimated that the amount of tax on Old FNF’s transfer and
    retirement of its FIS stock in the merger could be in the range
    of $1 billion and possibly greater depending on, among
    other things, the value of our stock at the time of the merger.

Even if the 2006 Distribution otherwise qualifies as a spin-off
    under Section 355 of the Code, the distribution of FNF
    common stock to the Old FNF stockholders in connection with the
    2006 Distribution would not qualify as tax-free to Old FNF (or
    us as its successor) under Section 355(e) of the Code if
    50% or more of the stock of Old FNF (including us as successor
    to Old FNF) or FNF is acquired as part of a plan or series of
    related transactions that includes the 2006 Distribution. As a
    result of our merger with Old FNF, approximately 49% of our
    stock would be treated as having been acquired pursuant to a
    plan that includes the 2006 Distribution for purposes of
    Section 355(e) of the Code.

There is no guaranty that FNF will have financial resources to
    satisfy any such indemnification obligation described above. If
    the tax-free status is lost because of any action taken by us or
    any of our subsidiaries after the time of the 2006 Distribution
    (except for certain actions specifically identified in the tax
    disaffiliation agreement), we would be required to pay the taxes
    described above ourself and would be required to indemnify FNF
    for all tax-related losses.

We may
    be affected by significant restrictions following the FNF Merger
    with respect to certain actions that could jeopardize the
    tax-free status of the spin-off by Old FNF of Fidelity National
    Title Group or the FNF Merger.

In order to preserve the tax-free treatment of the spin-off by
    Old FNF of Fidelity National Title Group, a tax
    disaffiliation agreement entered into by FNF and us prior to the
    closing under the FNF Merger agreement restricts us, for two
    years after the spin-off, from taking certain actions within our
    control that could cause the spin-off to be taxable without
    first obtaining a consent of certain officers of FNF or
    obtaining an opinion from a nationally recognized law firm or
    accounting firm that such action will not cause the spin-off to
    be taxable to FNF under Section 355(e) of the Code. In
    general, such actions would include engaging in certain
    transactions involving (i) the acquisition of our stock or
    (ii) the issuance of shares of our stock.

Because of these restrictions, we may be limited in the amount
    of stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or raise
    additional capital in the two years subsequent to the spin-off
    and the FNF Merger and in our ability to repurchase shares of
    our common stock.

We may
    experience software defects, development delays, and
    installation difficulties, which would harm our business and
    reputation and expose us to potential liability.

Many of our services are based on sophisticated software and
    computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing
    new applications and services. Further, the software underlying
    our services has occasionally contained and may in the future
    contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or
    when new versions are released. In addition, we may experience
    difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on
    platforms used by our customers. Defects in our software,
    errors, or delays in the processing of electronic transactions,
    or other difficulties could result in:

•

interruption of business operations;

•

late delivery to the market;

•

delay in market acceptance;

•

additional development and remediation costs;

•

diversion of technical and other resources;



•

loss of customers;

•

impact on growth expectations;

•

negative publicity; or

•

exposure to liability claims.

Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through
    disclaimers and limitation-of-liability provisions in our
    license and customer agreements, we cannot be certain that these
    measures will be successful in limiting our liability.

Security
    breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by
    disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our
    reputation.

As part of our business, we electronically receive, process,
    store, and transmit sensitive business information of our
    customers. In addition, we collect personal consumer data, such
    as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver’s
    license numbers, checking and savings account numbers, and
    payment history records. Unauthorized access to our computer
    systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of
    confidential information or the deletion or modification of
    records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our
    operations. These concerns about security are increased when we
    transmit information over the Internet. Computer viruses have
    also been distributed and have rapidly spread over the Internet.
    Computer viruses could infiltrate our systems, disrupting our
    delivery of services and making our applications unavailable.
    Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses
    could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our
    systems and terminate their agreements with us, and could
    inhibit our ability to attract new customers.

Many
    of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to
    industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the
    number of transactions in which our customers engage and
    therefore reduces our revenues.

Our customers are subject to a number of government regulations
    and industry standards with which our services must comply. For
    example, our services are affected by VISA and MasterCard
    electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice
    annually. In addition, action by regulatory authorities relating
    to credit availability, data usage, privacy, or other related
    regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our
    customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we
    fail to comply with privacy regulations imposed on providers of
    services to financial institutions, our business could be
    harmed.

As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are
    bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information
    we receive from our customers as apply to the financial
    institutions themselves. If we fail to comply with these
    regulations, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract
    or to governmental proceedings, our customer relationships and
    reputation could be harmed, and we could be inhibited in our
    ability to obtain new customers. In addition, if more
    restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted in the future on
    the federal or state level, or, with respect to our
    international operations, by authorities in foreign
    jurisdictions on the national, provincial, state, or other
    level, that could have an adverse impact on us.

If we
    experience system failures, the services we provide to our
    customers could be delayed or interrupted, which could harm our
    business and reputation and result in the loss of
    customers.

Our ability to provide reliable service in a number of our
    businesses depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations
    of our computer network systems and data centers. Our systems
    and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from
    fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure,
    unauthorized entry, and computer viruses. Although we have taken
    steps to prevent system failures, we cannot be certain that our
    measures



will be successful. Further, our property and business
    interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for
    all losses or failures that may occur. Any significant
    interruptions could:

•

increase our operating expenses to correct problems caused by
    the interruption;

•

harm our business and reputation;

•

result in a loss of customers; or

•

expose us to liability.

Any one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    and results of operations.

We
    face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have
    guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s
    bank.

If a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check
    writer’s bank, we must reimburse our merchant customer for
    the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount
    from the delinquent check writer. In some cases, we recognize a
    liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns
    and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from
    the check writers, based on historical experience and other
    relevant factors. The estimated check returns and recovery
    amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may
    exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less
    than our estimates.

Misappropriation
    of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair
    our competitive position.

Our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and
    technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
    rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our
    services or to obtain and use information that we regard as
    proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights
    is difficult. We cannot make any assurances that the steps we
    have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that
    the agreements entered into for that purpose will be
    enforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, and
    trade secret protection may not be available in every country in
    which our applications and services are made available online.
    Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential
    litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

If our
    applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary
    rights of others, we may be required to change our business
    practices and may also become subject to significant costs and
    monetary penalties.

As our information technology applications and services develop,
    we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any
    claims, whether with or without merit, could:

•

be expensive and time-consuming to defend;

•

cause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that
    incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

require us to redesign our applications, if feasible;

•

divert management’s attention and resources; and

•

require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in
    order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies.

We may
    not succeed with our current and future expansion of our
    international operations and such failure may adversely affect
    our growth and results of operations.

In 2007, sales outside of the U.S. represented
    approximately 11.2% of our revenues. We believe there are
    additional opportunities to expand our international operations,
    and we expect to commit significant resources to



expand our international sales and marketing activities.
    However, overall we are less well-known internationally than in
    the United States and have less experience with local business
    conditions. In addition, we will face challenges in successfully
    managing small operations located far from our headquarters,
    because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding
    operations from a distance, and we will be increasingly subject
    to a number of other risks and potential costs, including:

•

political and economic instability;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and policy, the
    adoption of laws detrimental to our operations such as
    legislation relating to the collection of personal data over the
    Internet or the adoption of laws, regulations, or treaties
    governing the export of encryption related software;

•

the burdens of complying with a wide variety of other laws and
    regulations;

•

failure to adequately manage currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

potential difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting
    receivables in some foreign legal systems; and

•

general economic conditions in international markets.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
    successfully against current or future international competitors.

Misappropriation
    of consumer data by a former employee could materially adversely
    affect our relationship with governing organizations, customers
    or regulators.

On July 3, 2007, we announced that a database administrator
    had misappropriated consumer information. To date, we have seen
    no evidence of the stolen information being used for anything
    other than marketing purposes. Nevertheless, multiple putative
    class action lawsuits were filed against us seeking monetary
    damages. Those class actions were settled in January of 2008,
    and the settlement received preliminary approval from the court
    in February of 2008. Although we do not believe that we face any
    material liability, there can be no assurance that this matter
    will not result in fines or other charges or adversely impact
    our relationships with the VISA and MasterCard issuing
    organizations, customers or regulators.

Statement
    Regarding Forward-Looking Information

The statements contained in this

Form 10-K

or in our other documents or in oral presentations or other
    statements made by our management that are not purely historical
    are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    including statements regarding our expectations, hopes,
    intentions, or strategies regarding the future. These statements
    relate to, among other things, our future financial and
    operating results. In many cases, you can identify
    forward-looking statements by terminology such as
    “may,” “will,” “should,”
    “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,”
    “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative
    of these terms and other comparable terminology. Actual results
    could differ materially from those anticipated in these
    statements as a result of a number of factors, including, but
    not limited to:

•

general political, economic, and business conditions, including
    the possibility of intensified international hostilities, acts
    of terrorism, and general volatility in the capital markets;

•

failures to adapt our services to changes in technology or in
    the marketplace;

•

consolidation in the mortgage lending or banking industry;

•

security breaches of our systems and computer viruses affecting
    our software;

•

a decrease in the volume of real estate transactions such as
    real estate sales and mortgage refinancings, which can be caused
    by high or increasing interest rates, a shortage of mortgage
    funding, or a weak United States economy;

•

the impact of competitive services and pricing;



•

the ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates and the
    ability to finance such acquisitions, which depends upon the
    availability of adequate cash reserves from operations or of
    acceptable financing terms and the variability of our stock
    price;

•

our ability to integrate any acquired business’ operations,
    services, clients, and personnel;

•

the effect of our substantial leverage, which may limit the
    funds available to make acquisitions and invest in our business;

•

changes in, or the failure to comply with, government
    regulations, including privacy regulations; and

•

other risks detailed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and
    in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We are not under any obligation (and expressly disclaim any such
    obligation) to update or alter our forward-looking statements,
    whether as a result of new information, future events or
    otherwise. You should carefully consider the possibility that
    actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking
    statements.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in
    various pending and threatened litigation matters related to
    operations, some of which include claims for punitive or
    exemplary damages. The Company believes that no actions, other
    than the matters listed below, depart from customary litigation
    incidental to its business. As background to the disclosure
    below, please note the following:

•

These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal
    issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities.

•

The Company reviews these matters on an on-going basis and
    follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

(“SFAS 5”), when making accrual and disclosure
    decisions. When assessing reasonably possible and probable
    outcomes, the Company bases decisions on the assessment of the
    ultimate outcome following all appeals.



Grace &
    Digital Information Technology Co., Ltd.

We and certain of our employees were named as defendants in a
    civil lawsuit brought by Grace & Digital Information
    Technology Co., Ltd. (“Grace”). Grace was a sales
    agent engaged by Alltel Information Services, Inc.
    (“AIS”) in June of 2001. In March of 2002 (before AIS
    was acquired by us) Grace’s contract was terminated because
    it was no longer providing sales agent services. In May of 2004,
    Grace asserted a claim against us for unpaid sales commissions,
    and filed suit later that same year. The case was subsequently
    dismissed and re-filed in March of 2006. In the second filing,
    Grace alleged damages caused by breach of contract, violation of
    the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
    (“RICO”) Act and violation of the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act (“FCPA”). Grace’s FCPA and RICO
    allegations prompted inquiries by both the SEC and the
    U.S. Department of Justice. We vigorously defended
    Grace’s civil lawsuit, and in March of 2007 the court
    dismissed the RICO claims with prejudice and struck Grace’s
    FCPA allegations. The parties subsequently settled the remaining
    breach of contract claim at court-ordered mediation in April of
    2007. The U.S. Department of Justice closed its
    investigation with no action being taken against the Company.
    The Company is awaiting a final determination from the SEC.

Driver’s
    Privacy Protection Act

A putative class action lawsuit styled Richard Fresco, et
    al. v. Automotive Directions, Inc. et al., was filed
    against eFunds and seven other non-related parties in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
    The complaint alleged that eFunds purchased motor vehicle
    records that were used for marketing and other purposes that are
    not permitted under the Federal Driver’s Privacy Protection
    Act (“DPPA”). The plaintiffs sought statutory damages,
    plus costs, attorney’s fees and injunctive relief. eFunds
    and five of the other seven defendants settled the case with the
    plaintiffs. That settlement was preliminarily approved by the
    court over the objection of a group of Texas drivers and motor
    vehicle record holders and is awaiting final approval. The
    objectors filed two class action complaints styled Sharon
    Taylor, et al. v. Biometric Access Company et al. and
    Sharon Taylor, et al. v. Acxiom et al. in the
    U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
    alleging similar violations of the DPPA. The Acxiom action is
    filed against eFunds subsidiary ChexSystems, Inc., while the
    Biometric suit is filed against Certegy Check Services, Inc.
    ChexSystems filed a motion to dismiss or stay the action based
    upon the earlier settlement which was granted. The action
    against Certegy Check Services, Inc. was voluntarily dismissed
    in February of 2008.

Employee
    Data Theft

On July 3, 2007, we announced that a database administrator
    had misappropriated consumer information. To date, we have seen
    no evidence of the stolen information being used for anything
    other than marketing purposes. Nevertheless, multiple putative
    class action lawsuits were filed against us seeking monetary
    damages. Those class actions were settled in January of 2008. In
    February of 2008, the court indicated that preliminary approval
    of the settlement would be granted, but a formal written order
    has not yet been entered.

(a)

As part of the merger transaction, Certegy declared a $3.75 per
    share special cash dividend that was paid to its pre-merger
    shareholders at the consummation of the Certegy Merger. As of
    February 1, 2008, there were approximately
    7,090 shareholders of record of our common stock.

We currently pay a $0.05 dividend on a quarterly basis, and
    expect to continue to do so in the future. The declaration and
    payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors, and depends on, among other things, our investment
    policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial
    condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other
    factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of
    Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions.
    Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by
    covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly
    dividend of $.05 per common share is payable March 27, 2008
    to shareholders on record as of the close of business on
    March 13, 2008.

Item 12 of Part III contains information concerning
    securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation
    plans.

On October 25, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a
    plan, effective for three years, authorizing repurchases of up
    to $200 million worth of our common stock. During the
    fourth quarter of 2007, we did not repurchase any of our common
    stock under this plan. We currently have $126.5 million of
    authorized repurchases available as of December 31, 2007.



Item 6.

Selected
    Financial Data.

The selected financial data set forth below constitutes
    historical financial data of Fidelity National Information
    Services, Inc. and should be read in conjunction with
    Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8,
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, included elsewhere
    in this report.

On February 1, 2006, FIS was merged into a wholly owned
    subsidiary of Certegy in a tax-free merger. For accounting and
    financial reporting purposes, the merger was treated as a
    reverse acquisition of Certegy by FIS under the purchase method
    of accounting pursuant to accounting principles generally
    accepted in the U.S. Accordingly, our historical financial
    information for periods prior to the Certegy Merger is the
    historical financial information of FIS.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

We are one of the largest global providers of processing
    services to financial institutions, serving customers in over 80
    countries throughout the world. We are among the market leaders
    in core processing, card issuing services, check point-of-sale
    verification and guarantee, mortgage processing, and certain
    other lender processing services in the U.S. We offer a
    diversified service mix, and benefit from the opportunity to
    cross-sell multiple services across our broad customer base. We
    have two reporting segments, TPS and LPS, which produced
    approximately 63% and 37%, respectively, of our revenues for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

•

TPS.

This segment focuses on serving
    the processing needs of financial institutions. Our primary
    software applications function as the underlying infrastructure
    of a financial institution’s core processing environment
    which banks use to maintain the primary records of their
    customer accounts. We also provide a number



of complementary applications and services, such as item
    processing and electronic funds transfer, that interact directly
    with the core processing applications, including applications
    that facilitate interactions between our financial institution
    customers and their clients such as online banking and bill
    payment services and fraud prevention and detection services. We
    offer our applications and services through a range of delivery
    and service models, including

on-site

outsourcing and remote processing arrangements, as well as on a
    licensed software basis for installation on customer-owned and
    operated systems. This segment also includes card issuer
    services, which enable banks, credit unions, and others to issue
    VISA and MasterCard credit and debit cards, private label cards,
    and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and
    business accounts. In addition, we provide point-of-sale check
    verification and guarantee services to retailers.

•

LPS.

This segment provides outsourced
    business processes, core mortgage processing and information
    solutions primarily to national lenders and loan servicers.
    These processes include centralized title agency and closing
    services offered to first mortgage, refinance, home equity and
    sub-prime lenders. This segment’s information solutions
    include appraisal and valuation services, real estate tax
    services and flood zone information. In addition, this segment
    provides default management services to national lenders and
    loan servicers, allowing customers to outsource the business
    processes necessary to take a loan and the underlying real
    estate securing the loan through the default and foreclosure
    process. On October 25, 2007, we announced that our Board
    of Directors had approved a plan to pursue a spin-off of the
    majority of our LPS division into a separate publicly traded
    company, which we refer to as LPS, Inc.

The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate
    overhead costs and other operations that are not included in the
    other segments.

On September 12, 2007, we completed the eFunds acquisition.
    The eFunds businesses have been integrated into our operations
    within our TPS segment.

Business
    Trends and Conditions

Transaction
    Processing Services

In the TPS business, increases in deposit and card transactions
    can positively affect our business and thus the condition of the
    overall economy can have an effect on growth.

In this segment, we compete for both licensing and outsourcing
    business, and thus are affected by the decisions of financial
    institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced
    arrangement or to process in-house under a software license and
    maintenance agreement. As a provider of outsourcing solutions,
    we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams. Generally,
    demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over time as
    providers such as us realize economies of scale and improve
    their ability to provide services that improve customer
    efficiencies and reduce costs.

Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total
    point-of-sale payments, which fuels continuing demand for
    card-related services. We continue to launch new services aimed
    at accommodating this demand. In recent years, we have
    introduced a variety of stored-value card types, Internet
    banking, and electronic bill presentment/payment services, as
    well as a number of card enhancement and loyalty/reward
    programs. The common theme among these offerings continues to be
    convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to
    the financial institution.

Consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or
    detrimental to the TPS businesses. When consolidations occur,
    merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from
    competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally
    makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a single
    platform. When a financial institution processing client is
    involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the use
    of our services if such services are chosen to survive the
    consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely,
    we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a
    consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the
    consolidation and support the newly combined entity.



Lender
    Processing Services

Our mortgage processing services business, driven by MSP, is
    largely subject to the number of residential mortgage loans
    outstanding which is influenced by overall home ownership. The
    level of residential real estate activity, which depends in part
    on the level of interest rates, affects the level of revenues
    from many of the other businesses in the LPS segment.

The slow down of real estate activity and the tightening of
    available credit in 2007 has resulted in a reduction in new loan
    origination and refinancing activity. The current MBA forecast
    is for $2.0 trillion of mortgage originations in 2008 as
    compared to $2.3 trillion in 2007. These factors are also likely
    to result in seasonal effects having more influence on real
    estate activity. Traditionally, the greatest volume of real
    estate activity, particularly residential resale transactions,
    has occurred in the spring and summer months.

In contrast, current market conditions have increased the volume
    of residential mortgage defaults and thus favorably affected our
    default management services, which provide services relating to
    residential mortgage loans in default. The overall strength of
    the economy also affects default revenues.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The accounting policies described below are those we consider
    critical in preparing our Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements. These policies require management to make estimates,
    judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to
    contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the
    Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
    Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See
    Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements for a more detailed description of the significant
    accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our
    Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenues in accordance with Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104 (“SAB No. 104”),

Revenue Recognition

and related interpretations,
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Emerging
    Issues Task Force

No. 00-21

(“EITF 00-21”),

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

, American
    Institute of Certified Public Accountant’s

SOP No. 97-2

“Software Revenue Recognition”

(“SOP 97-2”),

SOP No. 98-9

Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions

(“SOP 98-9”),

and

SOP No. 81-1,

Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain
    Production-Type Contracts

(“SOP 81-1”).

Recording revenues under the provisions of these pronouncements
    requires judgment, including determining whether or not an
    arrangement includes multiple elements, whether any of the
    elements are essential to the functionality of any other
    elements, and whether evidence of fair value exists for those
    elements. Customers receive certain contract elements over time
    and changes to the elements in an arrangement, or in our ability
    to identify fair value for these elements, could materially
    impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in
    our financial statements.

The primary judgments relating to our revenue recognition are
    determining when all of the following criteria are met under
    SAB 104: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered; (3) the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed
    or determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Under

EITF 00-21,

judgment is also required to determine whether an arrangement
    involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit
    of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be
    measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting.

If the deliverables under a contract are software related as
    determined under

SOP 97-2

or

SOP 98-9,

we apply these pronouncements and related interpretations to
    determine the appropriate units of accounting and how the
    arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to
    the separate units. This determination, as well as
    management’s ability to establish vendor specific objective
    evidence (“VSOE”) for the individual deliverables, can
    impact both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under
    these agreements. The inability to establish VSOE for each
    contract deliverable results in having to record deferred
    revenues

and/or

applying the residual method as defined in

SOP 98-9.

For arrangements where we determine VSOE for software
    maintenance using a stated renewal



rate within the contract, we use judgment to determine whether
    the renewal rate represents fair value for that element as if it
    had been sold on a stand-alone basis. For a small percentage of
    revenues, we use contract accounting, as required by

SOP No. 97-2,

when the arrangement with the customer includes significant
    customization, modification, or production of software. For
    elements accounted for under contract accounting, revenue is
    recognized in accordance with

SOP 81-1,

Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain
    Production-Type Contracts

, using the
    percentage-of-completion method since reasonably dependable
    estimates of revenues and contract hours applicable to various
    elements of a contract can be made.

Occasionally, we are party to multiple concurrent contracts with
    the same customer. These situations require judgment to
    determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated
    or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition. In
    making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating
    and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of
    the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment
    terms of the contracts are interrelated.

Due to the large number, broad nature and average size of
    individual contracts we are a party to, the impact of judgments
    and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any
    single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our
    consolidated operations. However the broader accounting policy
    assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes
    of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount
    of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of
    operations or financial position.

Reserves
    for Check Guarantee Losses

In our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented
    to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s
    bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s
    face value and pursue collection of the amount from the
    delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and anticipated
    recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical
    analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and
    considering other factors that could affect that experience in
    the future. Such factors include the general economy, the
    overall industry mix of our customer volumes, statistical
    analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and
    the quality of returned checks. Once these factors are
    considered, we establish a rate for check losses that is
    calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar
    volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is
    calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total
    amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied
    against the dollar volume processed and check losses,
    respectively, each month and charged to costs of revenues. The
    estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk
    that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than
    our estimates. We had accrued claims payable and accrued claims
    recoverable balances of $27.4 million and
    $39.4 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $30.0 million and $39.4 million at December 31,
    2006, respectively.

Historically, such estimation processes have proven to be
    materially accurate; however, our projections of probable check
    guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently
    uncertain, and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the
    amount of such items. Changes in economic conditions, the risk
    characteristics and composition of our customers, and other
    factors could impact our actual and projected amounts. We
    recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries
    excluding service fees, of $113.8 million and
    $102.9 million, respectively, for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. A ten percent difference in our
    estimated gross check guarantee losses and our estimated
    recoveries as of December 31, 2007 could impact
    2007 net earnings by approximately $4.5 million
    after-tax.

Computer
    Software

Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired
    in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized
    software development costs. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, computer software, net of accumulated amortization was
    $780.7 million and $640.8 million, respectively.
    Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the
    straight line method over its estimated useful life and software
    acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value
    and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over
    their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 10 years.
    In determining useful lives, management considers historical
    results and technological trends which may influence the
    estimate. Amortization expense for computer software



was $177.8 million, $130.2 million and
    $91.7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also
    assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on
    a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated
    future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software
    asset. There are inherent uncertainties in determining the
    expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer
    software; however, we have not historically experienced
    significant changes in these estimates but could be subject such
    changes in the future.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We have significant intangible assets that were acquired through
    business acquisitions. These assets consist of purchased
    customer relationships, contracts, and the excess of purchase
    price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired
    (goodwill).

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, goodwill was
    $5.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The
    process of determining whether or not an asset, such as
    goodwill, is impaired or recoverable relies on projections of
    future cash flows, operating results and market conditions. Such
    projections are inherently uncertain and, accordingly, actual
    future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash
    flows. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we perform
    an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units based
    on an analysis of the discounted future net cash flows generated
    by the reporting units’ underlying assets. Such analyses
    are particularly sensitive to changes in future business trends
    and economic conditions which can significantly influence our
    estimates of future net cash flows and discount rates. Changes
    to these estimates might result in material changes in the fair
    value of the reporting units and determination of the
    recoverability of goodwill potentially leading to charges
    against earnings and a reduction in the carrying value of our
    goodwill.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, intangible assets, net of
    accumulated amortization, were $1.0 billion, and consisted
    primarily of purchased customer relationships and trademarks.
    The valuation of these assets involves significant estimates and
    assumptions concerning matters such as customer retention,
    future cash flows and discount rates. If any of these
    assumptions change, it could affect the recoverability of the
    carrying value of these assets. Purchased customer relationships
    are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an
    accelerated method which takes into consideration expected
    customer attrition rates over a ten-year period. All intangible
    assets that have been determined to have indefinite lives are
    not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually
    in accordance with SFAS No. 142. During 2005, we
    recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $9.3 million to
    write-off the carrying value of customer relationships which
    were terminated at one subsidiary in the LPS segment. The
    determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of
    the purchase price to the fair values of the intangible assets
    require significant judgment and may affect the amount of future
    amortization on the intangible assets other than goodwill.
    Amortization expense for intangible assets other than goodwill
    was $168.7 million, $175.6 million and
    $125.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There
    is an inherent uncertainty in determining the expected useful
    life or cash flows to be generated from intangible assets. We
    have not historically experienced significant changes in these
    estimates but could be subject to them in the future.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial
    statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of
    the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves
    estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing
    temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of
    items for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences
    result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are
    included within the consolidated balance sheets. We must then
    assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be
    recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we
    believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation
    allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or
    increase this allowance in a period, we must reflect this
    increase as an expense within income tax expense in the
    statement of earnings. Determination of the income tax expense
    requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may
    require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the
    geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual
    pre-tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate
    to vary from period to period. We believe that our tax positions
    comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide
    for any known tax contingencies. We believe the estimates and
    assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit
    realization are reasonable. However, final determination of
    prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax
    authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be
    materially



different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and
    historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final
    determinations could have a material effect on our income tax
    provision, net income or cash flows in the period that
    determination is made.

Recent
    Developments

Lender
    Processing Services Spin Off

On October 25, 2007, we announced that our Board of
    Directors had approved pursuing a plan to spin-off the
    businesses that currently make up our LPS segment into a stand
    alone publicly traded company which will be known as Lender
    Processing Services, Inc. (“LPS, Inc.”). As currently
    contemplated, we will contribute the majority of the assets and
    liabilities of this segment into LPS, Inc. in exchange for
    additional shares of the LPS, Inc. common stock and
    approximately $1.6 billion principal amount of LPS, Inc.
    debt securities. Following receipt of necessary approvals from
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and
    a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
    and an opinion from our special tax advisor with respect to the
    tax-free nature of the spin-off, we will distribute 100% of the
    LPS, Inc. common stock to our shareholders in the spin-off and
    exchange the LPS, Inc. debt securities for a like amount of our
    existing debt. We expect that the spin-off will be tax-free to
    FIS and our shareholders, and that the debt-for-debt exchange
    will be tax-free to FIS. We will then retire the debt that is
    exchanged for the LPS, Inc. debt securities. Completion of the
    spin-off is expected to occur in mid-2008. FIS’s current
    Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Carbiener, is expected to be the
    Chief Executive Officer of LPS, Inc.

In January 2008, we filed a ruling request with the IRS
    regarding the tax-free nature of the LPS, Inc. spin-off and
    intend to file a preliminary Form 10 Registration Statement
    with the SEC in the first quarter of 2008. Completion of the
    spin-off is contingent upon the satisfaction or waiver of a
    variety of conditions, including final approval of the spin-off
    and all related arrangements by our Board of Directors. The
    completion of the proposed



spin-off is also subject to risks and uncertainties including
    but not limited to those associated with our ability to
    contribute the LPS segment assets and liabilities to LPS, Inc.,
    with the ability of LPS, Inc. to complete the debt exchange in
    the manner and on the terms currently contemplated, the
    possibility that necessary governmental approvals or actions
    (from the IRS, the SEC or other authorities) will not be
    obtained, and market conditions for the spin-off.

Evaluation
    of Check Services Business

On August 2, 2007, we announced that our management is
    evaluating strategic alternatives for our U.S. and
    Australian check services businesses. Our Board of Directors
    authorized the plan, allowing management to investigate
    strategic alternatives. Check Services is a leading provider of
    retail point-of-sale check risk management solutions, as well as
    of cash access services to the gaming industry. Subsequent to
    year end, on February 28, 2008, we announced that we
    entered into an agreement to sell Certegy Gaming Services, Inc.
    to Global Cash Access Holdings, Inc. for approximately
    $100.0 million in cash, which includes cash used to fund
    its ATM operations. The sale is expected to close in late March
    or early April of 2008.

Factors
    Affecting Comparability

Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in
    this report that present our financial condition and operating
    results reflect the following significant transactions:

•

On September 12, 2007, we acquired eFunds. eFunds provided
    risk management, EFT services, prepaid/gift card processing, and
    global outsourcing solutions to financial services companies in
    the U.S. and internationally. In connection with this
    acquisition, we borrowed an additional $1.6 billion under
    our bank credit facilities.

•

On August 31, 2007, we completed the sale of one of our
    subsidiaries, Property Insight, to FNF, for $95.0 million
    in cash, realizing a pre-tax gain of $66.9 million
    ($42.1 million after-tax) which is reported as a
    discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of
    earnings in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Property
    Insight was a leading provider of title plant services to FNF,
    as well as to various national and regional title insurance
    underwriters. Property Insight primarily managed, maintained,
    and updated the title insurance plants that are owned by FNF. As
    a result of the transaction, we received related party revenues
    from FNF through August 31, 2007, but incurred related
    party expenses relating to our title agency operation’s
    access to Property Insight’s data since the sale.

•

On April 25, 2007, the board of directors of Covansys
    entered into an agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation
    (“CSC”) under which CSC agreed to acquire Covansys for
    $34.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. The merger closed
    on July 3, 2007, and we exchanged our remaining
    6.9 million shares of stock for cash, and 4.0 million
    warrants for cash, per the terms of the merger agreement. We
    realized a pre-tax gain on sales of Covansys securities of
    $274.5 million in 2007.

•

On February 1, 2006, we merged into a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Certegy. The transaction resulted in a reverse
    acquisition with a total purchase price of approximately
    $2.2 billion. Certegy provided credit card, debit card, and
    other transaction processing and check risk management services
    to financial institutions and merchants in the U.S. and
    internationally through two segments, Card Services and Check
    Services.

Although the legal entity that survived the Certegy Merger was
    Certegy (which has since been renamed Fidelity National
    Information Services, Inc.), for accounting purposes, our
    historical financial statements are those of FIS. Our
    Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements include the
    results of operations of Certegy from the date of the
    acquisition. As a result of this transaction, the results of
    operations in the periods covered by the Consolidated and
    Combined Financial Statements may not be directly comparable.

Processing
    and Services Revenues

Processing and services revenues totaled $4,758.0 million,
    $4,042.2 million and $2,688.2 million in 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The increase in revenue in 2007 of
    $715.8 million, or 17.7% as compared to 2006 is primarily
    attributable to organic growth across both segments, as well as
    increases attributable to acquisitions and newly formed
    operations. The eFunds acquisition contributed
    $166.6 million in the TPS segment from its
    September 12, 2007 completion date through
    December 31, 2007 and the Certegy Merger contributed one



additional month of revenue in the current year, or
    approximately $96.4 million as compared to the full year
    2006. The additional growth in the TPS segment was attributable
    to increased sales to new customers, particularly in our
    international operations. Our new Brazilian outsourcing
    operation added $40.5 million to the increase in the
    current year. The growth in the LPS segment was primarily the
    result of increased demand for services, due to market share
    gains and the current real estate market conditions, within our
    default management and appraisal businesses, partially offset by
    decreased demand for other real estate related businesses,
    decreased related party activity with FNF, and by the
    deconsolidation of Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions, Inc.
    (“FNRES”) in the current year. The increase in revenue
    in 2006 of $1,353.9 million as compared to 2005 is
    primarily due to incremental revenues from the February 1,
    2006 Certegy Merger, which contributed $1,067.2 million to
    the overall increase. The remaining 2006 increase is
    attributable to growth across both segments, including 15.2%
    growth in TPS, excluding the impact of Certegy, and 6.7% growth
    in LPS. The growth in TPS was driven by strong new sales within
    Integrated Financial Solutions and International, while the
    growth in LPS was driven by market share gains in default and
    appraisal services.

Cost of
    Revenues

Cost of revenues totaled $3,401.9 million,
    $2,875.3 million and $1,750.2 million in 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The increase in cost of revenues of
    $526.6 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily
    attributable to increased costs associated with increased
    revenues across both segments and the inclusion of expenses
    relating to eFunds since its acquisition date, which totaled
    $120.3 million. The impact of the one additional month of
    Certegy in the current year was approximately
    $76.0 million. The increases were slightly offset by the
    deconsolidation of FNRES in the current year. The increase in
    cost of revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 of
    $1,125.1 million was primarily due to incremental cost of
    revenues from the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger which
    contributed $848.2 million to the overall increase. An
    increase in depreciation and amortization expense to
    $383.0 million in 2006 from $252.5 million in 2005
    resulting from additional intangible amortization related to the
    Certegy Merger also contributed to the year-over-year increase.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (“gross
    margin”) was 28.5%, 28.9% and 34.9% in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The slight decrease in gross margin in 2007 as
    compared to 2006 is primarily due to the LPS segment, which has
    had significant growth in slightly lower margin service lines,
    particularly our appraisal services. We have also experienced
    declining margins in our tax and property exchange services due
    to overall slowing of the real estate market. The decrease in
    gross margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the
    February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger, because the historical
    Certegy businesses typically have lower margins than those of
    the historically owned FIS businesses. Incremental intangible
    amortization expense relating to the Certegy Merger also
    contributed to the decrease in gross margin in 2006.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled
    $504.1 million, $498.2 million and $411.9 million
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase of
    $5.9 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily resulted
    from the inclusion of $15.2 million of expenses relating to
    eFunds since its acquisition date, as well as one additional
    month of Certegy in the current year. These 2007 increases were
    partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation
    expense, and the deconsolidation of FNRES in the current year.
    Stock-based compensation decreased from $50.1 million in
    2006 to $39.0 million in 2007. The decrease in stock-based
    compensation is attributable to the $24.5 million in
    expense recorded for the vesting of the FIS performance-based
    options granted in March 2005 for which the performance criteria
    was met during the first quarter of 2006 and an acceleration
    charge of $6.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter
    relating to the FNF Merger. Other cost reduction targets,
    related to the integration of Certegy, during the current year
    have been achieved, helping to further offset the additional
    expense related to eFunds and Certegy. The increase of
    $86.3 million in selling, general and administrative
    expenses for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily relates to
    incremental selling, general and administrative expenses from
    the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger which contributed
    $73.7 million to the overall increase. Additionally, the
    increase was partly due to an increase in stock based
    compensation expense which increased from $20.4 million
    during 2005



to $50.1 million for 2006. This increase in stock-based
    compensation is primarily attributable to the $24.5 million
    and $6.1 million in transaction-related expense described
    above.

Research
    and Development Costs

Research and development costs totaled $106.3 million,
    $105.6 million and $113.5 million for 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

Operating
    Income

Operating income totaled $745.6 million,
    $563.1 million and $412.6 million for 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue
    (“operating margin”) was 15.7%, 13.9% and 15.3% for
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in operating
    margin for 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to
    the increased revenues and achievement of expense synergies
    relating to the Certegy Merger. The year-over-year decrease in
    operating margin for 2006 is primarily due to incremental
    intangible asset amortization relating to the Certegy Merger,
    increased stock based compensation costs and other merger
    related costs, as well as relatively lower gross profit
    percentage associated with the Certegy service lines, as noted
    above.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense totaled $228.3 million,
    $192.8 million and $126.8 million for 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2007 as
    compared to 2006 is a result of our new debt related to the
    acquisition of eFunds, as well as the inclusion of
    $27.2 million in write-offs of capitalized debt issuance
    costs relating to our prior credit facility. The increases are
    partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates and the
    lower long-term debt balance through the date of the eFunds
    acquisition. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as
    compared to 2005 primarily relates to an increase in interest
    rates and higher average borrowings. The recapitalization that
    occurred late in the first quarter of 2005 resulted in a full
    year of interest in 2006 as compared to approximately ten months
    in 2005.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense totaled $300.5 million,
    $139.2 million and $107.1 million for 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate on
    continuing operations of 37.0%, 37.2% and 37.2% for 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The increase in tax expense for 2007 as
    compared to 2006 is attributable to increased operating income
    and the gain on sale of Covansys common stock and warrants. The
    decrease in the overall effective tax rate for 2007 is due to
    the increase in foreign pre-tax income, which is taxed at
    overall lower rates.

Net
    Earnings

Net earnings from continuing operations totaled
    $510.5 million, $240.9 million and $181.3 for 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, or $2.60, $1.27 and $1.41 per
    diluted share, respectively. Included in net earnings in 2007 is
    an after tax gain of $172.9 million, or $0.88 per diluted
    share, from the sale of Covansys common stock and warrants. Net
    earnings from discontinued operations (including the gain on
    disposition of Property Insight) were $50.8 million,
    $18.1 million and $15.2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and diluted
    earnings per share from discontinued operations totaled $0.26,
    $0.10 and $0.12 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

Revenues for the TPS segment are derived from three main revenue
    channels: Enterprise Solutions, Integrated Financial Solutions
    and International. Revenues from TPS totaled
    $2,985.1 million, $2,458.8 million and
    $1,208.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    overall segment increase of $526.3 million in 2007 as
    compared to 2006 resulted from the previously mentioned organic
    growth in our International and Integrated Financial Solutions
    business lines and in core processing revenues for large banks,
    combined with the impact of the acquisition of eFunds, which
    added incremental revenues of $166.6 million, and one
    additional month of Certegy revenues, which totaled
    $96.4 million. The launch of our Brazilian item processing
    operation during the third quarter of 2006 contributed
    $40.5 million to the increase. The increases were partially
    offset by a reduction in revenues in our retail point-of-sale
    authorization business. The overall segment increase of
    $1,250.4 million during 2006, as compared to 2005, was
    primarily attributable to the Certegy Merger which contributed
    $1,067.2 million to the overall increase. Like 2007, the
    majority of the remaining 2006 growth is attributable to organic
    growth within Integrated Financial Solutions and International
    revenue channels, with International including
    $31.9 million related to the newly formed business process
    outsourcing operation in Brazil.

Cost of revenues for the TPS segment totaled
    $2,308.7 million, $1,914.1 million and
    $904.1 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    overall segment increase of $394.6 million in 2007 as
    compared to 2006 resulted from increased labor and other
    variable costs associated with increased revenues, the impact of
    the acquisition of eFunds, and one additional month of Certegy.
    The overall segment increase of $1,010.0 million during
    2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the
    Certegy Merger which contributed $848.2 million to the
    increase. Gross margin was 22.7%, 22.2% and 25.2% for 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The increase in gross margin in 2007 as
    compared to 2006 is primarily due to lower intangible
    amortization expense. The decrease in gross margin in 2006 as
    compared to 2005 is primarily due to the February 1, 2006
    Certegy Merger, which businesses typically have lower margins
    than those of the historically owned FIS businesses. Incremental
    intangible asset amortization relating to the Certegy Merger
    also contributed to the decrease in gross margin.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the TPS segment
    totaled $191.4 million, $171.1 million and
    $94.9 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    increase of $20.3 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 is
    primarily attributable to increased labor costs, the impact of
    the acquisition of eFunds, and one additional month of Certegy,
    offset by achieving cost reduction targets related to the
    integration of Certegy during the current year. The increase in
    2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the Certegy
    Merger which contributed $73.7 million to the overall
    increase of $76.2 million.

Research and development costs for the TPS segment totaled
    $70.4 million, $70.9 million and $85.7 million
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Operating income for the TPS segment totaled
    $414.5 million, $302.6 million and $123.7 million
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating margin was
    approximately 13.9%, 12.3% and 10.2% for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The increase in 2007, as compared to 2006,
    primarily resulted from the increased gross margin, as well as a
    decrease, as a percentage of revenue, of 0.6% in selling,
    general, and administrative expenses and 0.5% in research and
    development costs. The increase in operating margin for 2006 as
    compared to 2005 resulted from a decrease, as a percentage of
    revenue, of 0.9% in selling, general and administrative expenses
    and 4.2% in research and development costs, partially offset by
    a decrease in gross margin as discussed above.

Revenues for the LPS segment totaled $1,761.1 million,
    $1,584.2 million and $1,484.3 million for 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The overall segment increase of
    $176.9 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from
    accelerating demand for services within our default management
    businesses, which contributed an increase of
    $206.7 million, and in our appraisal services, which
    contributed $75.3 million. These increases are partially
    offset by decreased demand for other real estate related
    businesses, decreased related party activity with FNF, and by
    the deconsolidation of FNRES in the current year. The overall
    segment increase of $99.9 million during 2006 as compared
    to 2005 was the result of growth across most of the business
    lines, but primarily due to increased demand for our appraisal
    services along with growth in our default management businesses.

Cost of revenues for the LPS segment totaled
    $1,093.2 million, $961.1 million and
    $846.1 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    overall segment increase of $132.1 million in 2007 as
    compared to 2006, as well as the increase of $115.0 million
    in 2006 as compared to 2005, resulted from increased personnel,
    data processing, and other variable costs associated with
    increased business. The deconsolidation of FNRES slightly offset
    the increase in 2007. Gross margin was 37.9%, 39.3% and 43.0%
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in gross
    margin in 2007 as compared to 2006, as well as 2006 as compared
    to 2005 was primarily due to significant growth in lower margin
    service lines, particularly our appraisal services and other
    certain default services, along with declining margins in our
    tax services due to lower volumes and the lengthening of the
    service period.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the LPS segment
    totaled $188.9 million, $197.4 million and
    $224.0 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    decrease of $8.5 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, as
    well as the decrease of $26.5 million in 2006 as compared
    to 2005 was primarily the result of cost control measures and
    the increased revenue base in the TPS segment for allocating
    certain combined selling and administrative expenses. The
    decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 is also related to the
    deconsolidation of FNRES, partially offset by increased
    headcount in the default management businesses, and increased
    overhead costs.

Research and development costs for the LPS segment totaled
    $35.9 million, $34.7 million and $27.8 million
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Operating income for the LPS segment totaled
    $443.1 million, $390.9 million and $386.5 million
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating margin was
    25.2%, 24.7% and 26.0% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    The increase in operating income in 2007, as compared to 2006,
    as well as 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily results from our
    increased revenue, partially offset by our decreasing gross
    margin.

Corporate
    and Other

The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate
    overhead costs that are not included in the other segments.
    Corporate costs are primarily incurred directly by us; however,
    the 2006 period includes some amounts that were allocated from
    FNF prior to our merger with Old FNF, including stock based
    compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $123.8 million, $129.7 million and $93.1 million
    in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2007 as
    compared to 2006 of $5.9 million primarily relates to a
    decrease in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset
    by additional costs associated with the eFunds acquisition and
    an increase in salaries and other labor costs. The increase in
    2006 as compared to 2005 of $36.6 million primarily relates
    to an increase in stock-based compensation expense which
    increased from $20.4 million in 2005 to $50.1 million
    in 2006, as well as an increase in merger and merger related
    integration costs. The increase in stock



based compensation primarily related to the $24.5 million
    in expense recorded in the first quarter of 2006 for the vesting
    of the FIS performance based options granted in March of 2005
    for which the performance criteria were met during 2006 and a
    $6.1 million charge related to the acceleration of vesting
    of stock options recorded in the fourth quarter relating to the
    FNF Merger.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash
    Requirements

Our cash requirements include cost of revenues, selling, general
    and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service
    payments, capital expenditures, systems development
    expenditures, stockholder dividends, and business acquisitions.
    Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations
    and borrowings.

At December 31, 2007, we had cash on hand of
    $355.3 million and debt of approximately
    $4,275.4 million, including the current portion. We expect
    cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be
    sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements and pay
    principal and interest on our outstanding debt absent any
    unusual circumstances such as acquisitions or adverse changes in
    the business environment.

We currently pay a $0.05 dividend on a quarterly basis, and
    expect to continue to do so in the future. The declaration and
    payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors, and depends on, among other things, our investment
    policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial
    condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other
    factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of
    Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions.
    Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by
    covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly
    dividend of $.05 per common share is payable March 27, 2008
    to shareholders of record as of the close of business on
    March 13, 2008.

We intend to limit dilution caused by option exercises,
    including anticipated exercises, by repurchasing shares on the
    open market or in privately negotiated transactions. On
    October 25, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a plan
    authorizing repurchases of up to an additional
    $200.0 million worth of our common stock. During 2007, we
    repurchased 1.6 million shares of our stock for
    $80.3 million, at an average price of $49.15 under this
    program.

Cash
    Flows from Operations

Cash flows from operations were $463.6 million,
    $494.7 million and $426.0 million in 2007, 2006 and
    2005 respectively. Included in 2007 cash flow from operations
    were payments of $106.6 million of tax liability relating
    to the gain on Covansys and a $47.5 million reduction in
    taxes payable due to stock option exercises. Included in 2006
    cash flow from operations was a $26.9 million reduction in
    taxes payable due to stock option exercises.

Capital
    Expenditures

Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software
    (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property
    and equipment. In 2007, we spent approximately
    $343.3 million on capital expenditures, and in 2008 we
    expect to spend approximately $280.0 million to
    $300.0 million, primarily on equipment, purchased software
    and internally developed software.

Financing

On January 18, 2007, we entered into a credit agreement
    with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing
    Line Lender, and Letter of Credit Issuer, Bank of America, N.A.,
    as Swing Line Lender, and other financial institutions party
    thereto (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement
    replaced our prior term loans and revolver as well as a
    $100 million settlement facility. As a result of the new
    credit agreement, we repaid the old credit agreement and
    recorded a charge of $27.2 million to write-off unamortized
    capitalized debt issuance costs. The Credit Agreement, which
    became secured as of September 12, 2007, provides for a
    committed $2.1 billion five-year term facility denominated
    in U.S. Dollars (the “Term Loan A”) and a
    committed $900 million revolving credit



facility (the “Revolving Loan”) with a sublimit of
    $250 million for letters of credit and a sublimit of
    $250 million for swing line loans, maturing on the fifth
    anniversary of the closing date (the “Maturity Date”).
    The Revolving Loan is bifurcated into a $735 million
    multicurrency revolving credit loan (the “Multicurrency
    Tranche”) that can be denominated in any combination of
    U.S. Dollars, Euro, British Pounds Sterling and Australian
    Dollars, and any other foreign currency in which the relevant
    lenders agree to make advances and a $165 million
    U.S. Dollar revolving credit loan that can be denominated
    only in U.S. Dollars. The swingline loans and letters of
    credit are available as a sublimit under the Multicurrency
    Tranche. In addition, the Credit Agreement originally provided
    for an uncommitted incremental loan facility in the maximum
    principal amount of $600 million, which would be made
    available only upon receipt of further commitments from lenders
    under the Credit Agreement sufficient to fund the amount
    requested by us. On July 30, 2007, we, along with the
    requisite lenders, executed an amendment to the existing Credit
    Agreement to facilitate our acquisition of eFunds. The amendment
    permitted the issuance of up to $2.1 billion in additional
    loans, an increase from the foregoing $600 million. The
    amendment became effective September 12, 2007. On
    September 12, 2007, we entered into a joinder agreement to
    obtain a secured $1.6 billion tranche of term loans
    denominated in U.S. Dollars (the “Term Loan B”)
    under the Credit Agreement, utilizing $1.6 billion of the
    $2.1 billion uncommitted incremental loan amount. The Term
    Loan B proceeds were used to finance the eFunds acquisition, and
    pay related fees and expenses. The Term Loan B will mature on
    January 18, 2014. Debt issuance costs of $25.9 million
    are capitalized at December 31, 2007 and will be amortized
    over the life of the agreement.

As of December 31, 2007, the Term Loan A balance was
    $2,047.5 million, the Term Loan B balance was
    $1,596.0 million and a total of $308.0 million was
    outstanding under the Revolving Loan. The obligations under the
    Credit Agreement have been jointly and severally,
    unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic
    subsidiaries. Additionally, we and certain subsidiary guarantors
    other than eFunds pledged certain equity interests we and they
    held in other entities (including certain of our direct and
    indirect subsidiaries) as collateral security for the
    obligations under the credit facility and the guarantee. The
    pledge also serves to equally and ratably secure our obligations
    under our outstanding 4.75% notes due 2008, discussed below.

We may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the Revolving
    Loan from time to time until the maturity of the Revolving Loan.
    We must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A
    in scheduled installments of: (a) $13.1 million per
    quarter from June 30, 2007 through December 31, 2008;
    (b) $26.3 million per quarter from March 31, 2009
    through December 31, 2009; and (c) $52.5 million
    per quarter from March 31, 2010 through September 30,
    2011, with the remaining balance of approximately
    $1.5 billion payable on the Maturity Date. We must make
    quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan B in scheduled
    installments of $4.0 million per quarter from
    December 31, 2007 through September 30, 2013 with the
    remaining balance of approximately $1.5 billion payable on
    January 18, 2014. As discussed above, we expect to exchange
    LPS, Inc. debt securities we will receive in connection with the
    LPS, Inc. spin-off for our outstanding Term Loan B, which will
    immediately thereafter be retired.

In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the Term Loans
    are (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory prepayment
    upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation events, and
    sales of assets, as well as from a percentage of excess cash
    flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) between zero and fifty
    percent commencing with the cash flow for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Voluntary prepayments of the Loans are
    generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice
    and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Commitment
    reductions of the Revolving Loan are also permitted at any time
    without fee upon proper notice. The Revolving Loan has no
    scheduled principal payments, but it will be due and payable in
    full on the Maturity Date.

The outstanding balance of the Loans bears interest at a
    floating rate, which is an applicable margin plus, at our
    option, either (a) the Eurocurrency (LIBOR) rate or
    (b) either (i) the federal funds rate or (ii) the
    prime rate. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based
    on a leverage ratio (our total indebtedness to our EBITDA in our
    consolidated subsidiaries, as further defined in the Credit
    Agreement). Alternatively, we have the ability to request the
    lenders to submit competitive bids for one or more advances
    under the Revolving Loan.

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and
    financial covenants customary for financings of this type,
    including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens,
    limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on
    investments and dispositions, a prohibition on the payment of
    dividends and other restricted



payments if an event of default has occurred and is continuing
    or would result therefrom, a minimum interest coverage ratio and
    a maximum leverage ratio. Upon an event of default, the
    Administrative Agent can accelerate the maturity of the loan.
    Events of default include conditions customary for such an
    agreement, including failure to pay principal and interest in a
    timely manner and breach of certain covenants. These events of
    default include a cross-default provision that permits the
    lenders to declare the Credit Agreement in default if
    (i) we fail to make any payment after the applicable grace
    period under any indebtedness with a principal amount in excess
    of $150 million or (ii) we fail to perform any other
    term under any such indebtedness, as a result of which the
    holders thereof may cause it to become due and payable prior to
    its maturity. We were in compliance with all covenants related
    to the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2007.

Both the Credit Agreement and the 4.75% notes referred to
    below are equally and ratably secured by a pledge of equity
    interests in our subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions for
    subsidiaries not required to be pledged. As of December 31,
    2007, the shares of subsidiaries representing less than 10% of
    our net assets were subject to such pledge.

Through the Certegy Merger, we have an obligation to service
    $200.0 million (aggregate principal amount) of secured
    4.75% fixed-rate notes due in 2008. The notes were recorded in
    purchase accounting at a discount of $5.7 million, which is
    being amortized over the term of the notes. The notes accrue
    interest at a rate of 4.75% per year, payable semi-annually in
    arrears on each March 15 and September 15. The notes
    include customary events of default, including a cross-default
    provision that permits the trustee or the holders of at least
    25% of the Notes to declare the Notes in default if (i) we
    fail to make any payment after the applicable grace period under
    any indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of
    $10 million or (ii) we fail to perform any other term
    under any such indebtedness, as a result of which the holders
    thereof have caused it to become due and payable prior to its
    maturity.

Through the eFunds acquisition on September 12, 2007, we
    assumed $100.0 million in long-term notes payable
    previously issued to eFunds (the “eFunds Notes”).
    Subsequent to year-end, we redeemed the eFunds Notes for a total
    of $109.3 million, which includes a make-whole premium of
    $9.3 million. We completed the redemption on
    February 26, 2008.

We have entered into the following interest rate swap
    transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure
    on our Term Loans from variable to fixed (in millions):

In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, we pay an
    applicable margin to our bank lenders on the Revolving Loan and
    the Term Loan A of 1.25% and the Term Loan B of 1.75%.

We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges
    in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. The estimated
    fair value of these cash flow hedges results in a liability of
    $41.2 million and an asset of $4.9 million, as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in other
    noncurrent assets or liabilities and as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes.
    A portion of the amount included in accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as
    a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term
    Loans.



Our existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there is
    no current impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It
    is our policy to execute such instruments with credit-worthy
    banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for
    speculative purposes.

Contractual
    Obligations

FIS’s long-term contractual obligations generally include
    its long-term debt and operating lease payments on certain of
    its property and equipment. The following table summarizes

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

FIS does not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements
    other than operating leases.

Escrow
    Arrangements

In conducting our title agency, closing and 1031 exchange
    services operations, we routinely hold customers’ assets in
    escrow, pending completion of real estate transactions. Certain
    of these amounts are maintained in segregated bank accounts and
    have not been included in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets. We have a contingent liability relating to proper
    disposition of these balances, which amounted to
    $1,926.8 million at December 31, 2007. As a result of
    holding these customers’ assets in escrow, we have ongoing
    programs for realizing economic benefits during the year through
    favorable borrowing and vendor arrangements with various banks.
    There were no loans outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and
    these balances were invested in short term, high grade
    investments that minimize the risk to principal.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141(R)”), requiring an acquirer in a
    business combination to recognize the assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
    acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date, with
    limited exceptions. The costs of the acquisition and any related
    restructuring costs will be recognized separately. Assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination
    are to be recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date
    and adjusted prospectively as new information becomes available.
    When the fair value of assets acquired exceeds the fair value of
    consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in
    the acquiree, the excess will be recognized as a gain. Under
    SFAS 141(R), all business combinations will be accounted
    for by applying the acquisition method, including combinations
    among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone.
    SFAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations
    for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual
    reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008,
    is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15,
    2008, and will apply to business combinations occurring after
    the effective date. Management is currently evaluating the
    impact of this statement on our statements of financial position
    and operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”), requiring noncontrolling interests
    (sometimes called minority interests) to be presented as a
    component of equity on the balance sheet. SFAS 160 also
    requires that the amount of net income attributable to the
    parent and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified
    and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of
    income. This statement eliminates the need to apply purchase



accounting when a parent company acquires a noncontrolling
    ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires that, upon
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary, a parent company recognize a
    gain or loss in net income after which any retained
    noncontrolling interest will be reported at fair value.
    SFAS 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated
    financial statements that identify and distinguish between the
    interests of the parent’s owners and the interest of the
    noncontrolling owners of subsidiaries. SFAS 160 is
    effective for periods beginning on or after December 15,
    2008 and will be applied prospectively except for the
    presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied
    retrospectively for all periods presented. Management is
    currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our
    statements of financial position and operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities
    to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value that are not currently required to be
    measured at fair value. SFAS 159 mandates certain financial
    statement presentation and disclosure requirements when a
    company elects to report assets and liabilities at fair value
    under SFAS 159. SFAS 159 is effective as of the
    beginning of January 1, 2008 for calendar year entities.
    Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS 159 on our statements of financial position and
    operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

As of December 31, 2007, we are paying interest on the
    Credit Agreement at LIBOR plus 1.25% and LIBOR plus 1.75% on our
    Term Loan A and Term Loan B, respectively. A one percent
    increase in the LIBOR rate would increase our annual debt
    service on the Credit Agreement by $10.2 million (based on
    principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2007, net of
    interest rate swaps). The credit rating assigned to FIS by
    Standard & Poor’s was BB at December 31,
    2007.

We have entered into the following interest rate swap
    transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure
    on our Term Loans from variable to fixed (in millions):

In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, we pay an
    applicable margin to our bank lenders on the Revolving Loan and
    the Term Loan A of 1.25% and the Term Loan B of 1.75%.

We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges
    in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. The estimated
    fair value of these cash flow hedges results in a liability of
    $41.2 million and an asset of $4.9 million, as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in other
    noncurrent assets or liabilities and as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes.
    A portion of the amount included in accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as
    a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term
    Loans.

Our existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there is
    no current impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It
    is our policy to execute such instruments with credit-worthy
    banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for
    speculative purposes.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited Fidelity National Information Services,
    Inc.’s and subsidiaries’ and affiliates’ (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and
    subsidiaries and affiliates maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Fidelity National Information
    Services, Inc. and subsidiaries and affiliates as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    and combined statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our
    report dated February 29, 2008 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated and combined financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries
    and affiliates (the “Company”) as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated and combined
    statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. These
    consolidated and combined financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    and combined financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated and combined financial
    statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of Fidelity National
    Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries and affiliates as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Fidelity
    National Information Services, Inc.’s and
    subsidiaries’ and affiliates’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
    February 29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated and combined
    financial statements, the Company completed an acquisition of
    eFunds Corporation on September 12, 2007 and as discussed
    in Note 15, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial
    Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, effective
    January 1, 2007.

(1)

Basis of
    Presentation

FIS is a leading provider of technology solutions, processing
    services, and information-based services to the financial
    services industry. On February 1, 2006, the Company
    completed a merger with Certegy (the “Certegy Merger”)
    (Note 6) which was accounted for as a reverse
    acquisition and purchase accounting was applied to the acquired
    assets and assumed liabilities of Certegy. In form, Certegy was
    the legal acquirer in the Certegy Merger and the continuing
    registrant for the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
    “SEC”) reporting purposes. However, due to the
    majority ownership in the combined entity held by FIS
    shareholders, FIS was designated the acquirer for accounting
    purposes and, effective on the Certegy Merger date, the
    historical financial statements of FIS became the historical
    financial statements of the continuing registrant for all
    periods prior to the Certegy Merger. The results of operations
    of Certegy are only included in these historical financial
    statements for periods subsequent to the Certegy Merger.
    Immediately after the Certegy Merger, the name of the SEC
    registrant was changed to Fidelity National Information
    Services, Inc.

In the

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
    improperly presented the impact of adopting Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 158,

Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
    Postretirement Plans

(“SFAS 158”) in the
    Statement of Comprehensive Earnings for 2006. The Company
    included the $6.9 million ($4.3 million, net of tax)
    impact of adopting SFAS 158 with the minimum pension
    liability adjustment in other comprehensive earnings for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. If the Company had properly
    excluded the SFAS 158 adjustment, the resulting amount of
    other comprehensive earnings would have been $49.2 million,
    net of tax. The Company corrected the 2006 amount reported in
    the Statement of Comprehensive Earnings in the

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2007. The correction has no
    impact on the Statement of Stockholders’ Equity for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

Shortly after consummating the Certegy Merger, the Company
    implemented a new organizational structure, which resulted in
    the formation of new operating segments beginning with the
    reporting of results for the first quarter of 2006
    (Note 19). Effective as of February 1, 2006, the
    Company’s reportable segments are Transaction Processing
    Services, or TPS, and Lender Processing Services, or LPS.

•

TPS.

This segment focuses on serving the
    processing needs of financial institutions. The Company’s
    primary software applications function as the underlying
    infrastructure of a financial institution’s core processing
    environment. These applications include core bank processing
    software, which banks use to maintain the primary records of
    their customer accounts. The Company also provides a number of
    complementary applications and services, such as item processing
    and electronic funds transfer, that interact directly with the
    core processing applications, including applications that
    facilitate interactions between the Company’s financial
    institution customers and their clients such as online banking
    and bill payment services and fraud prevention and detection
    services. The Company offers its applications and services
    through a range of delivery and service models, including

on-site

outsourcing and remote

AND SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

processing arrangements, as well as on a licensed software basis
    for installation on customer-owned and operated systems. This
    segment also includes card issuer services, which enable banks,
    credit unions, and others to issue VISA and MasterCard credit
    and debit cards, private label cards, and other electronic
    payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts. In
    addition, the Company provides point-of-sale check verification
    and guarantee services to retailers.

•

LPS.

This segment provides outsourced business
    processes, core mortgage processing and information solutions
    primarily to national lenders and loan services. These processes
    include centralized, title agency and closing services offered
    to first mortgage, refinance, home equity and sub-prime lenders.
    This segment’s information solutions include appraisal and
    valuation services, real estate tax services and flood zone
    information. In addition, this segment provides default
    management services to national lenders and loan servicers,
    allowing customers to outsource the business processes necessary
    to take a loan and the underlying real estate securing the loan
    through the default and foreclosure process. On October 25,
    2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had
    approved a plan to pursue a spin-off of the majority of its LPS
    division into a separate publicly traded company, which is
    referred to as LPS, Inc.

The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate
    overhead costs and other operations that are not included in the
    other segments.

On September 12, 2007, the Company completed the
    acquisition of eFunds Corporation (“eFunds”)
    (Note 6). The eFunds businesses have been integrated with
    the Company’s operations within the TPS segment.

(2)

Combination
    with Old FNF

On June 25, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement and
    plan of merger (the “FNF Merger Agreement”) with Old
    FNF (amended September 18, 2006) (the “FNF
    Merger”). The FNF Merger was one step in a plan that
    eliminated Old FNF’s holding company structure and majority
    ownership of FIS. In connection with this plan, Old FNF also
    entered into a securities exchange and distribution agreement
    (the “SEDA”) with its subsidiary Fidelity National
    Title Group, Inc. (“FNT”). Under the SEDA, Old
    FNF agreed that, prior to the merger, Old FNF would transfer
    substantially all its assets and liabilities to FNT, in exchange
    for shares of FNT common stock. Old FNF then would spin-off all
    shares of FNT stock it held to the stockholders of Old FNF in a
    tax-free distribution. Pursuant to the FNF Merger Agreement, on
    November 9, 2006 Old FNF merged with and into FIS, with FIS
    continuing as the surviving corporation. In consideration for
    the FNF Merger, Old FNF stockholders received an aggregate of
    96,521,877 shares of FIS stock for their Old FNF shares. In
    addition, in connection with the FNF Merger, FIS issued options
    to purchase FIS common stock and shares of FIS restricted stock
    in exchange for certain Old FNF options and restricted stock
    outstanding at the time of the FNF Merger. The FNF Merger
    followed the completion, on October 24, 2006, of FNT’s
    acquisition under the SEDA of substantially all of the assets
    and liabilities of Old FNF (other than Old FNF’s interests
    in FIS and in FNF Capital Leasing, Inc., a small subsidiary
    which merged into FIS in a separate transaction) in exchange for
    45,265,956 shares of FNT’s Class A common stock,
    and Old FNF’s subsequent spin-off of its FNT shares (the
    “FNT Distribution”). Pursuant to the SEDA and after
    the completion of all of the transactions, FNT was renamed
    Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (“FNF”) and now
    trades under the symbol FNF. Old FNF Chairman and CEO William P.
    Foley, II, assumed a similar position in FNF and now serves
    as its Chairman and as Executive Chairman of FIS, and other key
    members of Old FNF senior management continued their involvement
    in both FNF and FIS in executive capacities.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that
    one of the two parties to the FNF Merger be designated as the
    acquirer for accounting purposes. However, Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Technical

Bulletin 85-5,

Issues Relating to Accounting for Business Combinations

provides that if a transaction lacks substance, it is not a
    purchase event and should be accounted for based on existing
    carrying amounts. In the FNF Merger, the minority interest of
    FIS has not changed and the only assets and liabilities of the
    combined entity after



FIDELITY
    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the exchange are those of FIS prior to the exchange. Because a
    change in ownership of the minority interest did not take place,
    the FNF Merger has been accounted for based on the carrying
    amounts of FIS’s assets and liabilities.

(3)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

The following describes the significant accounting policies of
    the Company which have been followed in preparing the
    accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

(a)  Principles
    of Consolidation and Combination and Basis of
    Presentation

Prior to March 9, 2005, the historical financial statements
    of the Company were presented on a combined basis. Beginning
    March 9, 2005, after all the assets and liabilities of the
    Company were formally contributed to the holding company, the
    historical financial statements of the Company have been
    presented on a consolidated basis for financial reporting
    purposes. The accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements include those assets, liabilities, revenues, and
    expenses directly attributable to FIS’s operations and,
    prior to March 9, 2005, allocations of certain FNF
    corporate assets, liabilities, and expenses to FIS.

All significant intercompany profits, transactions and balances
    have been eliminated in consolidation or combination. The
    financial information included herein does not necessarily
    reflect what the financial position and results of operations of
    the Company would have been had it operated as a stand-alone
    entity during the periods covered.

The Company’s investments in less than 50% owned
    partnerships and affiliates are accounted for using the equity
    method of accounting.

All dollar amounts presented in these notes and in the
    accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements
    (except per share amounts) are in thousands unless indicated
    otherwise.

(b)  Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting balance sheets and cash flows, highly
    liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered cash equivalents. The carrying
    amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for these
    instruments approximate their fair value.

(c)  Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of financial instruments, which include trade
    receivables and long-term debt, approximate their carrying
    values. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve
    uncertainties and significant judgment in the interpretation of
    current market data. Therefore, the values presented are not
    necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize or
    settle currently. The Company holds, or has held, certain
    derivative instruments, specifically interest rate swaps and
    warrants relating to certain majority-owned subsidiaries
    (Note 3(d)).

(d)  Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,

(“SFAS No. 133”) as amended. During
    2005, 2006 and 2007, the Company engaged in hedging activities
    relating to its variable rate debt through the use of interest
    rate swaps. The Company designates these interest rate swaps as
    cash flow hedges. The estimated fair values of the cash flow
    hedges are recorded as an asset or liability of the Company and
    are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in
    other non-current assets and or other long term liabilities, as
    appropriate, and as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. A portion of the
    amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is
    recorded as



FIDELITY
    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are
    made on the Company’s Term Loans (Note 14). The
    Company’s existing cash flow hedges are highly effective
    and there is no current impact on earnings due to hedge
    ineffectiveness. It is the policy of the Company to execute such
    instruments with credit-worthy banks and not to enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Settlement Deposits, Receivables, and
    Payables.

The Company records settlement
    receivables and payables that result from timing differences in
    the Company’s settlement process with merchants, financial
    institutions, and credit card associations related to merchant
    and card transaction processing and third-party check
    collections. Cash held by FIS associated with this settlement
    process is classified as settlement deposits in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

(f)  Other
    receivables

Other receivables represent amounts due from consumers related
    to deferred debit processing services offered in Australia and
    the U.K., amounts due from financial institutions for the
    settlement of transactions in the Company’s cash access
    business, fees due from financial institutions related to the
    Company’s property exchange

facilitation business, certain lease receivables and income
    taxes receivable. The carrying value for these receivables
    approximates their fair value.

(g)  Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of
    identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
    business combinations. SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and
    Intangible Assets

(“SFAS No. 142”)
    requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be
    amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their
    estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(“SFAS No. 144”). SFAS No. 142 and
    SFAS No. 144 also provide that goodwill and other
    intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be
    amortized, but shall be tested for impairment annually or more
    frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment,
    through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. The
    Company measures for impairment on an annual basis during the
    fourth quarter using a September 30th measurement date
    unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement.

(h)  Long-lived
    Assets

SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets and
    intangible assets with definite useful lives be reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by
    comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated
    undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
    asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated
    future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
    fair value of the asset.

(i)  Intangible
    Assets

The Company has intangible assets which consist primarily of
    customer relationships that are recorded in connection with
    acquisitions at their fair value based on the results of the
    valuation analysis. Customer relationships are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method which
    takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates up to
    a ten-year period. Intangible assets with estimated useful lives
    are reviewed for impairment in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144 while intangible assets that are
    determined to have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment
    at least annually in accordance with SFAS No. 142.

(j)  Computer
    Software

Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired
    in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized
    software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at
    cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its
    estimated useful life and software acquired in business
    combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using
    straight-line or accelerated methods over its estimated useful
    life, ranging from five to ten years.

Capitalized software development costs are accounted for in
    accordance with either SFAS No. 86,

Accounting for
    the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
    Marketed

(“SFAS No. 86”), or with the
    American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (“AICPA”) Statement of Position (“SOP”)

No. 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use

(“SOP 98-1”).

After the technological feasibility of the software has been
    established (for SFAS No. 86 software), or at the
    beginning of application development (for

SOP No. 98-1

software), software development costs, which include salaries
    and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors
    incurred during development, are capitalized. Research and
    development costs incurred prior to the establishment of
    technological feasibility (for SFAS No. 86 software),
    or prior to application development (for

SOP No. 98-1

software), are expensed as incurred. Software development costs
    are amortized on a product by product basis commencing on the
    date of general release of the products (for



FIDELITY
    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 86 software) and the date placed in service
    for purchased software (for

SOP No. 98-1

software). Software development costs (for SFAS No. 86
    software) are amortized using the greater of (1) the
    straight-line method over its estimated useful life, which
    ranges from three to ten years or (2) the ratio of current
    revenues to total anticipated revenue over its useful life.

(k)  Deferred
    Contract Costs

Cost of software sales and outsourced data processing and
    application management arrangements, including costs incurred
    for bid and proposal activities, are generally expensed as
    incurred. However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of a
    contract are deferred and expensed over the contract life. These
    costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific
    internal costs that are directly related to the contract
    acquisition or transition activities and are primarily
    associated with installation of systems/processes and data
    conversion.

In the event indications exist that a deferred contract cost
    balance related to a particular contract may be impaired,
    undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected
    over its remaining term and compared to the unamortized deferred
    contract cost balance. If the projected cash flows are not
    adequate to recover the unamortized cost balance, the balance
    would be adjusted to equal the contract’s net realizable
    value, including any termination fees provided for under the
    contract, in the period such a determination is made.

(l)  Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
    computed primarily using the straight-line method based on the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets: thirty years for
    buildings and three to seven years for furniture, fixtures and
    computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using
    the straight-line method over the lesser of the initial term of
    the applicable lease or the estimated useful lives of such
    assets.

(m)  Income
    Taxes

Through March 8, 2005, the Company’s operating results
    were included in FNF’s Consolidated U.S. Federal and
    State income tax returns. The provision for income taxes in the
    Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings is made at
    rates consistent with what the Company would have paid as a
    stand-alone taxable entity in those periods. Beginning on
    March 9, 2005, the Company became its own tax paying
    entity. The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities for temporary differences between the financial
    reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets
    and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating
    loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact
    on deferred income taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if
    any, is reflected in the Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements in the period enacted.

(n)  Revenue
    Recognition

The following describes the Company’s primary types of
    revenues and its revenue recognition policies as they pertain to
    the types of transactions the Company enters into with its
    customers. The Company enters into arrangements with customers
    to provide services, software and software related services such
    as post-contract customer support and implementation and
    training either individually or as part of an integrated
    offering of multiple services. These services occasionally
    include offerings from more than one segment to the same
    customer. The revenues for services provided under these
    multiple element arrangements are recognized in accordance with
    the applicable revenue recognition accounting principles as
    further described below.



FIDELITY
    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In its TPS business, the Company recognizes revenues relating to
    bank processing and credit and debit card processing services
    along with software licensing and software related services.
    Several of the Company’s contracts include a software
    license and one or more of the following services: data
    processing, development, implementation, conversion, training,
    programming, post-contract customer support and application
    management. In some cases, these services are offered in
    combination with one another and in other cases the Company
    offers them individually. Revenues from processing services are
    typically volume-based depending on factors such as the number
    of accounts processed, transactions processed and computer
    resources utilized. Revenues from these arrangements are
    recognized as services are performed in accordance with SEC
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104
    (“SAB No. 104”),

Revenue Recognition

and related interpretations. SAB No. 104 sets forth
    guidance as to when revenue is realized or realizable and earned
    when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the
    seller’s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and
    (4) collectability is reasonably assured.

Revenues and costs related to implementation, conversion and
    programming services associated with the Company’s data
    processing and application management agreements during the
    implementation phase are deferred and subsequently recognized
    using the straight-line method over the term of the related
    services agreement. The Company evaluates these deferred
    contract costs for impairment in the event any indications of
    impairment exist. A relatively small percentage of credit card
    processing revenue is generated from the merchant institution
    processing business, where the relationship is with the
    financial institution that contracts directly with the merchant.
    In this business, the Company is responsible for collecting and
    settling interchange fees with the credit card associations,
    thus interchange fees are included as a component of revenue and
    costs of revenue.

In the event that the Company’s arrangements with its
    customers include more than one service, the Company determines
    whether the individual revenue elements can be recognized
    separately in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Emerging Issues Task Force

No. 00-21

(“EITF 00-21”),

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.

EITF 00-21

addresses the determination of whether an arrangement involving
    more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of
    accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be
    measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting.

If the services are software related services as determined
    under AICPA’s

SOP 97-2

Software Revenue Recognition

(“SOP 97-2”),

and

SOP 98-9

Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions

(“SOP 98-9”)

the Company applies these pronouncements and related
    interpretations to determine the appropriate units of accounting
    and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and
    allocated to the separate units.

The Company recognizes software license and post-contract
    customer support fees as well as associated development,
    implementation, training, conversion and programming fees in
    accordance with

SOP No. 97-2

and

SOP No. 98-9.

Initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists, the
    fee is fixed or determinable, software delivery has occurred and
    collection of the receivable is deemed probable, provided that
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) has been
    established for each element or for any undelivered elements.
    The Company determines the fair value of each element or the
    undelivered elements in multi-element software arrangements
    based on VSOE. If the arrangement is subject to accounting under

SOP No. 97-2,

VSOE for each element is based on the price charged when the
    same element is sold separately, or in the case of post-contract
    customer support, when a stated renewal rate is provided to the
    customer. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements
    exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered
    elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method.
    Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
    elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the
    arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. If evidence of fair
    value does not exist for one or more undelivered elements of a
    contract, then all revenue is deferred until all elements are
    delivered or fair value is determined for all remaining
    undelivered elements. Revenue from post-contract customer
    support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
    The Company records deferred revenue for all billings invoiced
    prior to revenue recognition.

    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

With respect to a small percentage of revenues, the Company uses
    contract accounting, as required by

SOP No. 97-2,

when the arrangement with the customer includes significant
    customization, modification, or production of software. For
    elements accounted for under contract accounting, revenue is
    recognized in accordance with

SOP 81-1,

Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain
    Production-Type Contracts,

using the
    percentage-of-completion method since reasonably dependable
    estimates of revenues and contract hours applicable to various
    elements of a contract can be made. Revenues in excess of
    billings on these agreements are recorded as unbilled
    receivables and are included in trade receivables. Billings in
    excess of revenue recognized on these agreements are recorded as
    deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met.
    Changes in estimates for revenues, costs and profits are
    recognized in the period in which they are determinable. When
    the Company’s estimates indicate that the entire contract
    will be performed at a loss, a provision for the entire loss is
    recorded in that accounting period.

In its LPS business, the Company recognizes revenues relating to
    mortgage processing services, loan facilitation services,
    default management services, and property data-related services.
    Mortgage processing arrangements are typically volume-based
    depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed,
    transactions processed and computer resources utilized. Revenue
    derived from software and service arrangements included in the
    LPS segment is recognized in accordance with

SOP No. 97-2

as discussed above. Loan facilitation services primarily consist
    of centralized title agency and closing services for various
    types of lenders. Revenues relating to loan facilitation
    services are typically recognized at the time of closing of the
    related real estate transaction. Ancillary service fees are
    recognized when the service is provided. Default management
    services assist customers through the default and foreclosure
    process, including property preservation and maintenance
    services (such as lock changes, window replacement, debris
    removal and lawn service), posting and publication of
    foreclosure and auction notices, title searches, document
    preparation and recording services, and referrals for legal and
    property brokerage services. Property data or data-related
    services principally include appraisal and valuation services,
    property records information, real estate tax services and
    borrower credit and flood zone information. Revenues derived
    from these services are recognized as the services are performed
    in accordance with SAB No. 104 as described above.

In addition, the Company’s flood and tax units provide
    various services including life-of-loan-monitoring services.
    Revenue for life-of-loan services is deferred and recognized
    ratably over the estimated average life of the loan service
    period, which is determined based on the Company’s
    historical experience and industry data. The Company evaluates
    its historical experience on a periodic basis, and adjusts the
    estimated life of the loan service period prospectively.

(o)  Cost
    of revenue and selling, general and administrative
    costs

Cost of revenue includes payroll, employee benefits, occupancy
    costs and other costs associated with personnel employed in
    customer service roles, including program design and development
    and professional services. Cost of revenue also includes data
    processing costs, amortization of software, customer
    relationship intangible assets and depreciation on operating
    assets.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses include payroll,
    employee benefits, occupancy and other costs associated with
    personnel employed in sales, marketing, human resources and
    finance roles. Selling, general, and administrative expenses
    also includes depreciation on non-operating corporate assets,
    advertising costs and other marketing-related programs.

(p)  Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Certain FIS employees are participants in the Fidelity National
    Information Services, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, which
    provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock
    options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentive awards
    to officers and key employees. Also, certain FIS employees were



FIDELITY
    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

participants in FNF’s stock-based compensation plans, until
    the FNF Merger. Through the acquisition of Certegy, the Company
    adopted the Certegy stock incentive plans, which also allow for
    the granting of stock-based awards. All of the outstanding
    awards as of January 31, 2006 under Certegy’s plans
    were vested prior to the Certegy Merger.

On November 9, 2006, as part of the closing of the FNF
    Merger, the Company assumed certain options and restricted stock
    grants that the Company’s employees and directors held
    under various FNF stock-based compensation plans. The Company
    assumed approximately 2.7 million options to replace
    4.9 million outstanding FNF options per the FNF Merger
    Agreement. The Company also assumed 0.1 million shares of
    restricted stock.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”)
    effective January 1, 2006. Prior to January 1, 2006,
    the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the
    fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”) which the Company adopted
    on January 1, 2003 under the prospective method as
    permitted by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
    Disclosure

(“SFAS No. 148”). Under the
    fair-value method, stock-based employee compensation cost was
    recognized from the beginning of 2003 as if the fair value
    method of accounting had been used to account for all employee
    awards granted, modified, or settled in years beginning after
    December 31, 2002. The Company has provided for stock
    compensation expense of $39.0 million, $50.1 million
    and $20.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
    which is included in selling, general, and administrative
    expense in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings.
    The year ended 2006 included stock compensation expense of
    $24.5 million relating to the FIS performance based options
    granted on March 9, 2005 for which the performance and
    market based criteria for vesting were met during the period and
    a $6.1 million charge relating to the acceleration of
    option vesting in connection with the FNF Merger. There was no
    material impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R as all
    options issued to the Company’s employees under FNF grants
    that had been accounted for under other methods were fully
    vested as of December 31, 2005. All grants of FIS options
    have been accounted for under fair value accounting under
    SFAS No. 123 or SFAS No. 123R.

The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 as if the Company had
    applied the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 to all awards held by FIS employees,

(q)  Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency for the foreign operations of the
    Company is either the U.S. Dollar or the local currency.
    For foreign operations where the local currency is the
    functional currency, the translation of foreign currencies into
    U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using
    exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for
    revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange
    rate during the period. The gains and losses resulting from the
    translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    earnings (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity and are excluded from net earnings.
    Realized gains or losses

resulting from other foreign currency transactions are included
    in other income (expense) and are insignificant for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.

(r)  Management
    Estimates

The preparation of these Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

In the Company’s check guarantee business, if a guaranteed
    check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the
    check writer’s bank, the Company reimburses the merchant
    customer for the check’s face value and pursues collection
    of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves
    and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by
    performing a historical analysis of the Company’s check
    loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that
    could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include
    the general economy, the overall industry mix of customer
    volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within
    customer volumes, and the quality of returned checks. Once these
    factors are considered, the Company establishes a rate for check
    losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses
    by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries
    that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the
    total amount of related check losses. These rates are then
    applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses,
    respectively, each month and charged to cost of revenue. The
    estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk
    that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than
    the Company’s estimates. The Company had accrued claims
    payable balances of $27.4 million and $30.0 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to these
    estimations. The Company had accrued claims recoverable of
    $39.4 million and $39.4 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, related to these estimations. In
    addition, the Company recorded check guarantee losses, net of
    anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of
    $113.8 million and $102.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount paid
    to merchant customers, net of amounts recovered from check
    writers excluding service fees, was $112.3 million and
    $107.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Because the check guarantee business was
    acquired as part of the Certegy Merger (see Note 6), there
    are no amounts related to this activity in the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

(s)  Net
    Earnings per Share

The basic weighted average shares and common stock equivalents
    are determined using the treasury stock method for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 include the shares and options that
    were previously outstanding at Certegy only from
    February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. If these
    shares and options had been outstanding for the entire twelve
    months of 2006, basic weighted average shares outstanding would
    have been approximately 191.3 million, common stock
    equivalents would have been 3.3 million and weighted
    average shares on a diluted basis would have been
    194.6 million.

(t)  Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141(R)”), requiring an acquirer in a
    business combination to recognize the assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
    acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date, with
    limited exceptions. The costs of the acquisition and any related
    restructuring costs will be recognized separately. Assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination
    are to be recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date
    and adjusted prospectively as new information becomes available.
    When the fair value of assets acquired exceeds the fair value of
    consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in
    the acquiree, the excess will be recognized as a gain. Under
    SFAS 141(R), all business combinations will be accounted
    for by applying the acquisition method, including combinations
    among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone.
    SFAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations
    for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual
    reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
    Management is currently evaluating the impact of this statement
    on the Company’s statements of financial position and
    operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”), requiring noncontrolling interests
    (sometimes called minority interests) to be presented as a
    component of equity on the balance sheet. SFAS 160 also
    requires that the amount of net income attributable to the
    parent and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified
    and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of
    income. This statement eliminates the need to apply purchase
    accounting when a parent company acquires a noncontrolling
    ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires that, upon
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary, a parent company recognize a
    gain or loss in net income after which any retained
    noncontrolling interest will be reported at fair value.
    SFAS 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated
    financial statements that identify and distinguish between the
    interests of the parent’s owners and the interest of the
    noncontrolling owners of subsidiaries. SFAS 160 is
    effective for periods beginning on or after December 15,
    2008 and will be applied prospectively except for the
    presentation and disclosure requirements,

which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented.
    Management is currently evaluating the impact of this statement
    on the Company’s statements of financial position and
    operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities
    to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value that are not currently required to be
    measured at fair value. SFAS 159 mandates certain financial
    statement presentation and disclosure requirements when a
    company elects to report assets and liabilities at fair value
    under SFAS 159. SFAS 159 is effective as of the
    beginning of January 1, 2008 for calendar year entities.
    Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS 159 on the Company’s statements of financial
    position and operations.

Related
    Party Transactions

The Company has historically conducted business with Old FNF and
    its subsidiaries, including FNF. In March 2005, in connection
    with the recapitalization of and sale of a minority equity
    interest in the Company, the Company entered into various
    agreements with Old FNF under which the Company has continued to
    provide title agency services, title plant management, and IT
    services. Further, the Company also entered into service
    agreements with Old FNF under which Old FNF continued to provide
    corporate services. In September 2005, when FNT was formed and
    the title insurance business was consolidated under FNT, many of
    these agreements were amended and restated to take into account
    the services that would be performed for and by FNT rather than
    Old FNF. On February 1, 2006, in connection with the
    closing of the Certegy Merger, many of these agreements were
    further amended and restated to reflect changes in the
    parties’ relationships. Certain of these agreements were
    further amended or terminated in connection with the FNF Merger
    and related transactions. A summary of these agreements in
    effect through December 31, 2007 is as follows:

•

Agreement to provide data processing
    services.

This agreement governs the revenues to
    be earned by the Company for providing IT support services and
    software, primarily infrastructure support and data center
    management, to FNF and its subsidiaries. Subject to certain
    early termination provisions (including the payment of minimum
    monthly service and termination fees), this agreement has an
    initial term of five years from February 2006 with an option to
    renew for one or two additional years.

•

Agreements to provide software development and
    services.

These agreements govern the fee
    structure under which the Company is paid for providing software
    development and services to FNF which consist of developing
    software for use in the title operations of FNF.

•

Arrangements to provide other real estate related
    services.

Under these arrangements the Company is
    paid for providing other real estate related services to FNF,
    which consist primarily of data services required by the title
    insurance operations.

•

Agreements by FNF to provide corporate services to the
    Company.

Through November 9, 2006, these
    agreements provided for FNF to provide general management,
    accounting, treasury, tax, finance, payroll, human resources,
    employee benefits, internal audit, mergers and acquisitions, and
    other corporate and administrative support to the Company. Since
    November 9, 2006, these charges only relate to certain less
    significant activities performed or recorded by FNF on behalf of
    the Company. The pricing of these services is at cost for
    services which are either directly attributable to the Company,
    or in certain circumstances, an allocation of the Company’s
    share of the total costs incurred by FNF in providing such
    services based on estimates that FNF and FIS believe to be
    reasonable.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Licensing, leasing, cost sharing and other
    agreements.

These agreements provide for the
    reimbursement of certain amounts from FNF or its subsidiaries
    related to various miscellaneous licensing, leasing, and cost
    sharing agreements, as well as the payment of certain amounts by
    the Company to FNF or its subsidiaries in connection with the
    Company’s use of certain intellectual property or other
    assets of or services by FNF.

•

Agreements to provide title agency
    services.

These agreements allow the Company to
    provide services to existing customers through loan facilitation
    transactions, primarily with large national lenders. The
    arrangement involves FIS providing title agency services which
    result in the issuance of title policies on behalf of title
    insurance underwriters owned by FNF and its subsidiaries.
    Subject to certain early termination provisions for cause, each
    of these agreements may be terminated upon five years’
    prior written notice, which notice may not be given until after
    the fifth anniversary of the effective date of each agreement,
    which ranges from July 2004 through September 2006 (thus
    effectively resulting in a minimum ten year term and a rolling
    one-year term thereafter). The LPS segment includes revenues
    from unaffiliated third parties of $132.2 million,
    $83.9 million and $80.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
    representing commissions on title insurance policies placed by
    the Company on behalf of title insurance subsidiaries of FNF.
    These commissions in aggregate are equal to approximately 89% of
    the total title premium from title policies that the Company
    place with subsidiaries of FNF. The Company also performs
    similar functions in connection with trustee sale guarantees, a
    form of title insurance that subsidiaries of FNF issue as part
    of the foreclosure process on a defaulted loan.

Sale
    of Property Insight, LLC

On August 31, 2007, the Company completed the sale of a
    subsidiary, Property Insight, LLC (“Property
    Insight”), to FNF, for $95.0 million in cash,
    realizing a pre-tax gain of $66.9 million
    ($42.1 million after-tax), based on net assets of
    $28.1 million. Property Insight is reported as a
    discontinued operation in the consolidated and combined
    statements of earnings for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 144.
    The net earnings from Property Insight, including related party
    revenues and expenses, are classified as earnings from
    discontinued operations in each statement of earnings presented.
    Property Insight contributed revenues of $52.6 million,
    $90.4 million and $77.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Property
    Insight contributed pretax profit of $13.7 million,
    $28.7 million and $24.1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Property
    Insight was a part of the LPS segment and was a leading provider
    of title plant services to FNF, as well as to various national
    and regional title insurance underwriters. Property Insight
    primarily managed, maintained, and updated the title insurance
    plants that are owned by FNF. As a result of the transaction,
    the Company received related party revenues from FNF through
    August 31, 2007, but the Company incurred related party
    expenses relating to the Company’s title agency
    operation’s access to Property Insight’s data since
    the sale. The prior agreements between FNF and FIS governed the
    fee structure under which the Company was paid for maintaining,
    managing and updating title plants owned by FNF’s title
    underwriters in certain parts of the country. The title plant
    maintenance agreement required, among other things, that FIS
    gather updated property information, organize it, input it into
    one of several systems, maintain or obtain the use of necessary
    software and hardware to store, access and deliver the data,
    sell and deliver the data to customers and provide various forms
    of customer support. The Company sold property information to
    title underwriters which are subsidiaries of FNF as well as to
    various unaffiliated customers. The Company paid FNF a royalty
    fee of 2.5% to 3.75% of the revenues received. In the case of
    the maintenance agreement, the Company was responsible for the
    costs of keeping the title plant assets current and functioning,
    and, in return, received the revenue generated by those assets.

The Company believes the amounts earned from or charged by FNF
    to FIS under each of the foregoing service arrangements were
    fair and reasonable. The Company believes that the approximate
    89% aggregate commission rate on title insurance policies is
    consistent with the blended rate that would be available to a
    third party title agent given the amount and the geographic
    distribution of the business produced and the low risk of loss
    profile of the business placed. The Company’s information
    technology infrastructure support and data center management
    services to FNF are priced within the range of prices the
    Company offers to third parties. However, the amounts the
    Company earned or that were charged under these arrangements
    were not negotiated at arm’s-length, and may not represent
    the terms that the Company might have obtained from an unrelated
    third party.

The Company also provides data processing services to Sedgwick
    CMS, Inc. (“Sedgwick”), a company in which FNF holds
    an approximate 40% equity interest. The Company recorded revenue
    relating to the Sedgwick arrangement of $37.8 million and
    $17.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively.

Other related party transactions:

Contribution
    of National New York

During the second quarter of 2006, Old FNF contributed the stock
    of National Title Insurance of New York, Inc.
    (“National New York”), a title insurance company, to
    the Company. This transaction was reflected as a contribution of
    capital from Old FNF in the amount of Old FNF’s historical
    basis in National New York of approximately $10.7 million.

Merger
    with FNF Capital

On October 26, 2006, the Company completed a merger with
    FNF Capital, Inc. (“FNF Capital”), a leasing
    subsidiary of Old FNF. The Company issued 279,000 shares of
    its common stock to Old FNF in exchange for a majority ownership
    in FNF Capital. The transaction was recorded at Old FNF’s
    historical basis in FNF Capital of approximately
    $2.3 million and the Company purchased the minority
    ownership shortly thereafter for $3.8 million in cash.
    Through the merger, the Company assumed a note payable to Old
    FNF of $13.9 million, and the Company recorded interest
    expense related to this note of $0.6 million and
    $0.2 million through September 30, 2007 and for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, respectively. On
    September 30, 2007, the Company sold certain leasing assets
    of

    the aforementioned note payable and other liabilities. The
    Company also recorded a $7.3 million note receivable from
    FNF relating to the transaction, and from October 1, 2007
    through December 31, 2007, the Company recorded interest
    income related to this note of $0.1 million.

Investment
    by FNF in Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions,
    Inc.

On December 31, 2006, FNF contributed $52.5 million to
    Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions, Inc.
    (“FNRES”), an FIS subsidiary, for approximately 61% of
    the outstanding shares of FNRES. As a result, since
    December 31, 2006, the Company no longer consolidates
    FNRES, but has recorded its remaining 39% interest as an equity
    investment in the amount of $30.5 million and
    $33.5 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The Company recorded equity losses (net of tax),
    from its investment in FNRES, of $1.9 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

Transactions
    with ABN AMRO Real and Banco Bradesco S.A.

The Company recorded revenues of $56.9 million and
    $24.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively, from ABN AMRO Real (“ABN”).
    The Company recorded revenues of $53.1 million and
    $19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively, from Banco Bradesco
    (“Bradesco”). Both ABN and Bradesco are venture
    partners in the Company’s Brazilian card business.

Recapitalization
    of FIS and Sale of Equity Interest

On March 9, 2005, the recapitalization of FIS was completed
    through $2.8 billion in borrowings under new senior credit
    facilities consisting of an $800 million Term Loan A
    facility, a $2.0 billion Term Loan B facility
    (collectively, the “Term Loan Facilities”) and a
    $400 million revolving credit facility (the
    “Revolver”). The Company fully drew upon the entire
    $2.8 billion in Term Loan Facilities to complete the
    recapitalization while the Revolver remained undrawn at the
    closing. Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wachovia Bank,
    Deutsche Bank and Bear Stearns led a consortium of lenders which
    provided the new senior credit facilities.

Concurrently, FIS sold a 25 percent equity interest to an
    investment group led by Thomas H. Lee Partners (THL) and Texas
    Pacific Group (TPG). The Company issued a total of
    32 million shares of common stock of FIS (as converted for
    the Certegy Merger) to the investment group for a total purchase
    price of $500 million. A new Board of Directors was created
    at FIS, with William P. Foley, II, then current Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer of FNF, serving as Chairman and
    Chief Executive Officer of FIS. FNF appointed four additional
    members to the FIS Board of Directors, while each of THL and TPG
    appointed two directors. On February 1, 2006 the Company
    completed its merger with Certegy and further changes were made
    to the Board of Directors and Lee Kennedy was appointed
    President and CEO of FIS (Note 6). The following steps were
    undertaken to consummate the recapitalization plan and equity
    interest sale. On March 8, 2005, the Company declared and
    paid a $2.7 billion dividend to FNF in the form of a note.
    On March 9, 2005, the Company borrowed $2.8 billion
    under its new senior credit facilities and then paid FNF
    $2.7 billion, plus interest in repayment of the note. The
    equity interest sale was then closed through the payment of
    $500 million from the investment group led by THL and TPG
    to the Company. The Company then repaid approximately
    $410 million outstanding under its November 8, 2004
    credit facility. Finally, the Company paid all expenses related
    to the transactions. These expenses totaled $79.2 million,
    consisting of $33.5 million in financing fees and
    $45.7 million in fees relating to the equity interest sale,
    including placement fees payable to the investors.

    Statements as capital contributions.

eFunds
    Corporation

On September 12, 2007, the Company completed its
    acquisition of eFunds. This acquisition expanded the
    Company’s presence in risk management services, EFT
    services, prepaid/gift card processing, and global outsourcing
    solutions to financial services companies in the U.S. and
    internationally. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger
    (the “eFunds Merger Agreement”) dated as of
    June 26, 2007, eFunds became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    FIS. The issued and outstanding shares of eFunds common stock,
    par value $0.01 per share were converted into the right to
    receive $36.50 per share in cash from FIS.

    Company adjusted its initial purchase accounting, and believes
    the valuations have been substantially completed as of
    December 31, 2007.

The Company is currently evaluating the various employment

    recognition of certain liabilities associated with exiting
    activities of the acquired company. The Company expects to
    substantially complete this evaluation during the first half of
    2008 and will adjust the amounts recorded as of
    December 31, 2007 to reflect the Company’s revised
    evaluations.

In connection with the eFunds Acquisition, the Company also
    adopted eFunds’ stock option plans and has registered
    approximately 2.2 million options and 0.2 million
    restricted stock units in replacement of similar outstanding
    awards held by eFunds employees. The amounts attributable to
    vested options are included as an adjustment to purchase price
    and the amounts attributable to unvested options and restricted
    stock units will be expensed over the remaining vesting period
    based on a valuation as of the date of closing.

Certegy

On September 14, 2005, the Company entered into a
    definitive merger agreement with Certegy under which the Company
    and Certegy combined operations to form a single publicly traded
    company called Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.
    (NYSE:FIS). Certegy was a payment processing company
    headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida. On
    January 26, 2006, Certegy’s shareholders approved the
    Certegy Merger, which was subsequently consummated on
    February 1, 2006. The Company acquired Certegy to expand
    its share of the payment processing services industry and create
    synergies with many of its other product lines.

Under the terms of the Certegy Merger agreement, the Company was
    merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of Certegy in a tax-free
    merger, and all of the Company’s outstanding stock was
    converted into Certegy common stock. As a result of the Certegy
    Merger:

•

The Company’s pre-merger shareholders owned approximately
    67.4% of the Company’s outstanding common stock immediately
    after the Certegy Merger, while Certegy’s pre-merger
    shareholders owned approximately 32.6%;

•

Immediately after the Certegy Merger, Old FNF and its
    subsidiaries owned approximately 51.0% of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock; and

•

The Company’s board of directors was reconstituted so that
    a majority of the board consisted of directors designated by the
    Company’s pre-merger shareholders.

In connection with the Certegy Merger, Certegy amended its
    articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized
    shares of capital stock from 400 million shares to
    800 million shares, with 600 million shares being
    designated as common stock and 200 million shares being
    designated as preferred stock. Additionally, Certegy amended its
    stock incentive plan to increase the total number of shares of
    common stock available for issuance under the current stock
    incentive plan by an additional 6 million shares, and to
    increase the limits on the number of

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

options, restricted shares, and other awards that may be granted
    to any individual in any calendar year. These changes were
    approved by Certegy’s shareholders on January 26, 2006.

As part of the Certegy Merger transaction, Certegy declared a
    $3.75 per share special cash dividend that was paid to
    Certegy’s pre-merger shareholders. This dividend, totaling
    $236.6 million, was declared by Certegy prior to the
    consummation of the Certegy Merger.

Generally accepted accounting principles in the
    U.S. require that one of the two companies in the
    transaction be designated as the acquirer for accounting
    purposes. FIS has been designated as the accounting acquirer
    because immediately after the Certegy Merger its shareholders
    held more than 50% of the common stock of the combined company.
    As a result, the Certegy Merger has been accounted for as a
    reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting.
    Under this accounting treatment, the Company is considered the
    acquiring entity and Certegy is considered the acquired entity
    for financial reporting purposes. The financial statements of
    the combined company after the Certegy Merger reflect the
    Company’s financial results on a historical basis and
    include the results of operations of Certegy from
    February 1, 2006.

The purchase price was based on the number of outstanding shares
    of common stock of Certegy on February 1, 2006, the date of
    consummation of the Certegy Merger, valued at $33.38 per share
    (which was the average of the trading price of Certegy common
    stock two days before and two days after the announcement of the
    Certegy Merger on September 15, 2005 of $37.13, less the
    $3.75 per share special dividend declared prior to closing). The
    purchase price also included the estimated fair value of
    Certegy’s stock options and restricted stock units
    outstanding at the transaction date.

In connection with the Certegy Merger, the Company announced
    that it intended to terminate and settle the Certegy
    U.S. Retirement Income Plan (pension plan). The estimated
    impact of this settlement was reflected in the purchase price
    allocation as an increase in the pension liability, less the
    fair value of the pension plan assets, based on estimates of the
    total cost to settle the liability through the purchase of
    annuity contracts or lump sum settlements to the beneficiaries.
    The Company received an Internal Revenue Service (the
    “IRS”) determination letter, dated July 26, 2007.
    The pension plan was terminated and the assets distributed
    during the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition to the pension
    plan obligation, the Company assumed liabilities for
    Certegy’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the
    “SERP”) and Postretirement Benefit Plan. The SERP was
    terminated and paid out during the first quarter of 2008. The
    total liability recorded as part of the purchase price
    allocation related to all three plans, net of the fair value of
    plan related assets, was $31.1 million.

The Company has evaluated the various lease agreements, vendor
    arrangements, and customer contracts of Certegy. This evaluation
    has resulted in the recognition of certain liabilities
    associated with exiting activities of the acquired company.

Also, the Certegy Merger triggered the performance criteria
    relating to performance stock option grants made in March 2005
    and these awards vested when the trading value of the
    Company’s stock remained above $31.27 for 45 consecutive
    trading days following the Certegy Merger. As a result, the
    Company recorded a charge of $24.1 million in the first
    quarter of 2006 and recorded an additional $0.4 million in
    the second quarter of 2006 relating to these options that became
    fully vested on April 7, 2006.

Investment
    in Covansys Corporation

On September 15, 2004, Old FNF acquired 11 million
    shares of common stock, and warrants to purchase 4 million
    additional shares, of Covansys Corporation
    (“Covansys”) common stock, a publicly traded
    U.S. based provider of application management and offshore
    outsourcing services with India-based operations, for
    $121.0 million in cash. Old FNF subsequently contributed
    the common stock and warrants to the Company which resulted in
    the Company owning approximately 29% of the common stock of
    Covansys. The Company accounted for the investment in common
    stock using the equity method of accounting. The accounting for
    the warrants was governed by the provisions of
    SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities

, and changes in the fair value of
    the warrants were recorded through equity in other comprehensive
    earnings.

On April 25, 2007, the board of directors of Covansys
    entered into an agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation
    (“CSC”) under which CSC agreed to acquire Covansys for
    $34.00 per share in an all-cash transaction.

Prior to the merger closing, the Company sold 4.1 million
    shares of Covansys stock. The merger closed on July 3,
    2007, and the Company exchanged its remaining 6.9 million
    shares of stock for cash, and 4.0 million warrants for
    cash, per the terms of the merger agreement. The Company
    received cash proceeds totaling $430.2 million and realized
    a pre-tax gain on sales of Covansys securities of
    $274.5 million in 2007.

On January 18, 2007, the Company entered into a credit
    agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative
    Agent, Swing Line Lender, and Letter of Credit Issuer, Bank of
    America, N.A., as Swing Line Lender, and other financial
    institutions party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”).
    The Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s prior term
    loans and revolver as well as a $100 million settlement
    facility. As a result of the new credit agreement, the Company
    repaid the old credit agreement and recorded a charge of
    $27.2 million to write-off unamortized capitalized debt
    issuance costs. The Credit Agreement, which became secured as of
    September 12, 2007, provides for a committed
    $2.1 billion five-year term facility denominated in
    U.S. Dollars (the “Term Loan A”) and a committed
    $900 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving
    Loan”) with a sublimit of $250 million for letters of
    credit and a sublimit of $250 million for swing line loans,
    maturing on the fifth anniversary of the closing date (the
    “Maturity Date”). The Revolving Loan is bifurcated
    into a $735 million multicurrency revolving credit loan
    (the “Multicurrency Tranche”) that can be denominated
    in any combination of U.S. Dollars, Euro, British Pounds
    Sterling and Australian Dollars, and any other foreign currency
    in which the relevant lenders agree to make advances and a
    $165 million U.S. Dollar revolving credit loan that
    can be denominated only in U.S. Dollars. The swingline
    loans and letters of credit are available as a sublimit under
    the Multicurrency Tranche. In addition, the Credit Agreement
    originally provided for an uncommitted incremental loan facility
    in the maximum principal amount of $600 million, which
    would be made available only upon receipt of further commitments
    from lenders under the Credit Agreement sufficient to fund the
    amount requested by the Company. On July 30, 2007, the
    Company, along with the requisite lenders, executed an amendment
    to the existing Credit Agreement to facilitate

    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Company’s acquisition of eFunds. The amendment
    permitted the issuance of up to $2.1 billion in additional
    loans, an increase from the foregoing $600 million. The
    amendment became effective September 12, 2007. On
    September 12, 2007, the Company entered into a joinder
    agreement to obtain a secured $1.6 billion tranche of term
    loans denominated in U.S. Dollars (the “Term Loan
    B”) under the Credit Agreement, utilizing $1.6 billion
    of the $2.1 billion uncommitted incremental loan amount.
    The Term Loan B proceeds were used to finance the eFunds
    acquisition, and pay related fees and expenses. The Term Loan B
    will mature on January 18, 2014. Debt issuance costs of
    $25.9 million are capitalized at December 31, 2007 and
    will be amortized over the life of the agreement.

As of December 31, 2007, the Term Loan A balance was
    $2,047.5 million, the Term Loan B balance was
    $1,596.0 million and a total of $308.0 million was
    outstanding under the Revolving Loan. The obligations under the
    Credit Agreement have been jointly and severally,
    unconditionally guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of
    the Company. Additionally, the Company and certain subsidiary
    guarantors other than eFunds pledged certain equity interests
    the Company and they held in other entities (including certain
    of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company) as
    collateral security for the obligations under the credit
    facility and the guarantee. The pledge also serves to equally
    and ratably secure the obligations of the Company under the
    Company’s outstanding 4.75% notes due 2008, discussed
    below.

The Company may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the
    Revolving Loan from time to time until the maturity of the
    Revolving Loan. The Company must make quarterly principal
    payments under the Term Loan A in scheduled installments of:
    (a) $13.1 million per quarter from June 30, 2007
    through December 31, 2008; (b) $26.3 million per
    quarter from March 31, 2009 through December 31, 2009;
    and (c) $52.5 million per quarter from March 31,
    2010 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance
    of approximately $1.5 billion payable on the Maturity Date.
    The Company must make quarterly principal payments under the
    Term Loan B in scheduled installments of $4.0 million per
    quarter from December 31, 2007 through September 30,
    2013 with the remaining balance of approximately
    $1.5 billion payable on January 18, 2014. As discussed
    in Item 1, the Company expects to exchange LPS, Inc. debt
    securities received in connection with the LPS, Inc. spin-off
    for the outstanding Term Loan B, which will immediately
    thereafter be retired.

In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the Term Loans
    are (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory prepayment
    upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation events, and
    sales of assets, as well as from a percentage of excess cash
    flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) between zero and fifty
    percent commencing with the cash flow for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Voluntary prepayments of the Loans are
    generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice
    and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Commitment
    reductions of the Revolving Loan are also permitted at any time
    without fee upon proper notice. The Revolving Loan has no
    scheduled principal payments, but it will be due and payable in
    full on the Maturity Date.

The outstanding balance of the Loans bears interest at a
    floating rate, which is an applicable margin plus, at the
    Company’s option, either (a) the Eurocurrency (LIBOR)
    rate or (b) either (i) the federal funds rate or
    (ii) the prime rate. The applicable margin is subject to
    adjustment based on a leverage ratio (total indebtedness to
    EBITDA of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, as
    further defined in the Credit Agreement). Alternatively, the
    Company has the ability to request the lenders to submit
    competitive bids for one or more advances under the Revolving
    Loan.

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and
    financial covenants customary for financings of this type,
    including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens,
    limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on
    investments and dispositions, a prohibition on the payment of
    dividends and other restricted payments if an event of default
    has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, a
    minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio.
    Upon an event of default, the Administrative Agent can
    accelerate the maturity of the loan. Events of default include
    conditions customary for such an agreement, including failure to
    pay principal and interest in a timely manner and breach of
    certain covenants. These events of default include a
    cross-default provision that permits the lenders to declare the
    Credit Agreement in default if (i) the Company fails to
    make any payment after the applicable grace period under any
    indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of

$150 million or (ii) the Company fails to perform any
    other term under any such indebtedness, as a result of which the
    holders thereof may cause it to become due and payable prior to
    its maturity. The Company was in compliance with all covenants
    related to the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2007.

Both the Credit Agreement and the 4.75% notes referred to
    below are equally and ratably secured by a pledge of equity
    interests in the Company’s subsidiaries, subject to certain
    exceptions for subsidiaries not required to be pledged. As of
    December 31, 2007, the shares of subsidiaries representing
    less than 10% of the Company’s net assets were subject to
    such pledge.

Through the Certegy Merger, the Company has an obligation to
    service $200.0 million (aggregate principal amount) of
    secured 4.75% fixed-rate notes due in 2008. The notes were
    recorded in purchase accounting at a discount of
    $5.7 million, which is being amortized over the term of the
    notes. The notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.75% per year,
    payable semi-annually in arrears on each March 15 and
    September 15. The notes include customary events of
    default, including a cross-default provision that permits the
    trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the Notes to declare
    the Notes in default if (i) the Company fails to make any
    payment after the applicable grace period under any indebtedness
    with a principal amount in excess of $10 million or
    (ii) the Company fails to perform any other term under any
    such indebtedness, as a result of which the holders thereof have
    caused it to become due and payable prior to its maturity.

Through the eFunds acquisition on September 12, 2007, the
    Company assumed $100.0 million in long-term notes payable
    previously issued to eFunds (the “eFunds Notes”)
    (Note 6). Subsequent to year-end, the Company redeemed the
    eFunds Notes for a total of $109.3 million, which includes
    a make-whole premium of $9.3 million. The Company completed
    the redemption on February 26, 2008.

In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, the Company
    pays an applicable margin to its bank lenders on the Revolving
    Loan and the Term Loan A of 1.25% and the Term Loan B of 1.75%.

The Company has designated these interest rate swaps as cash
    flow hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

. The estimated fair value of these cash flow
    hedges results in a liability of $41.2 million and an asset
    of $4.9 million, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, which is included in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets in other noncurrent assets or liabilities and as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of
    deferred taxes. A portion of the amount included in accumulated
    other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest
    expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on
    the Term Loans.

The Company’s existing cash flow hedges are highly

Management believes that based on its historical pattern of
    taxable income, the Company will produce sufficient income in
    the future to realize its deferred income tax assets. A
    valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred
    income tax asset if management believes it is more likely than
    not that the Company will not be able to realize the benefits or
    portion of a deferred income tax asset. Adjustments to the
    valuation allowance will be made if there is a change in
    management’s assessment of the amount of deferred income
    tax asset that is realizable.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had income
    taxes receivable of $32.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has federal,
    state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards resulting in
    deferred tax assets of $65.0 million and
    $42.0 million, respectively. The federal net operating
    losses result in deferred tax assets at December 31, 2007
    and 2006 of $13.6 million and $17.5 million,
    respectively, which

expire between 2019 and 2024. The Company anticipates fully
    utilizing these net operating losses prior to expiration. The
    Company also has state net operating loss carryforwards
    resulting in a deferred tax asset of $5.3 million at
    December 31, 2007. The Company has a full valuation
    allowance against this amount at December 31, 2007. The
    Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards resulting
    in deferred tax assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006 of
    $45.6 million and $24.4 million, respectively. The
    Company has valuation allowances against these net operating
    losses at December 31, 2007 and 2006 of $5.2 million
    and $6.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007
    and 2006, the Company had foreign tax credit carryovers of
    $12.4 million and $12.7 million, respectively, which
    expire between 2010 and 2025. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the Company has a valuation allowance against
    $2.3 million of foreign tax credits that the Company’s
    management believes it is more likely than not that it will not
    realize the benefit.

As of January 1, 2005, the IRS selected the Company to
    participate in the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) which is a
    real-time audit for 2005 and future years. The IRS has completed
    its review for years

2002-2006

which resulted in an immaterial adjustment for tax year 2004
    related to a temporary difference and no changes to any other
    tax year. Tax years 2007 and 2008 are currently under audit by
    the IRS. Currently management believes the ultimate resolution
    of the 2007 and 2008 examinations will not result in a material
    adverse effect to the Company’s financial position or
    results of operations.

The Company provides for United States income taxes on earnings
    of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently
    reinvested outside the United States. At December 31, 2007,
    the cumulative earnings on which United States taxes have not
    been provided for were $159.0 million. If these earnings
    were repatriated to the United States, they would generate
    foreign tax credits that could reduce the federal tax liability
    associated with the foreign dividend.

The 2007 calendar year is the first year the Company is required
    to adopt FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”). As a
    result of the adoption, the Company had no change to reserves
    for uncertain tax positions. Interest and penalties on accrued
    but unpaid taxes are classified in the consolidated financial
    statements as income tax expense.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at

The total amount of interest expense recognized in the
    consolidated and combined statements of earnings for unpaid
    taxes is $1.4 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in
    the consolidated balance sheet is $8.4 million at
    December 31, 2007.

Due to the expiration of various statutes of limitation in the

Litigation

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in
    various pending and threatened litigation matters related to
    operations, some of which include claims for punitive or
    exemplary damages. The Company believes that no actions, other
    than the matters listed below, depart from customary litigation
    incidental to its business. As background to the disclosure
    below, please note the following:

•

These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal
    issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities.

•

The Company reviews these matters on an on-going basis and
    follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

    disclosure decisions. When assessing reasonably possible and
    probable outcomes, the Company bases decisions on the assessment
    of the ultimate outcome following all appeals.

Grace &
    Digital Information Technology Co., Ltd.

The Company and certain of its employees were named as
    defendants in a civil lawsuit brought by Grace &
    Digital Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“Grace”).
    Grace was a sales agent engaged by Alltel Information Services,
    Inc. (“AIS”) in June of 2001. In March of 2002 (before
    AIS was acquired by the Company) Grace’s contract was
    terminated because it was no longer providing sales agent
    services. In May of 2004, Grace asserted a claim against the
    Company for unpaid sales commissions, and filed suit later that
    same year. The case was subsequently dismissed and re-filed in
    March of 2006. In the second filing, Grace alleged damages
    caused by breach of contract, violation of the Racketeer
    Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (“RICO”) Act and
    violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
    (“FCPA”). Grace’s FCPA and RICO allegations
    prompted inquiries by both the SEC and the U.S. Department
    of Justice. The Company vigorously defended Grace’s civil
    lawsuit, and in March of 2007 the court dismissed the RICO
    claims with prejudice and struck Grace’s FCPA allegations.
    The parties subsequently settled the remaining breach of
    contract claim at court-ordered mediation in April of 2007. The
    U.S. Department of Justice closed its investigation with no
    action being taken against the Company. The Company is awaiting
    a final determination from the SEC.

Driver’s
    Privacy Protection Act

A putative class action lawsuit styled Richard Fresco, et
    al. v. Automotive Directions, Inc. et al., was filed
    against eFunds and seven other non-related parties in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
    The complaint alleged that eFunds purchased motor vehicle
    records that were used for marketing and other purposes that are
    not permitted under the Federal Driver’s Privacy Protection
    Act (“DPPA”). The plaintiffs sought statutory damages,
    plus costs, attorney’s fees and injunctive relief. eFunds
    and five of the other seven defendants settled the case with the
    plaintiffs. That settlement was preliminarily approved by the
    court over the objection of a group of Texas drivers and motor
    vehicle record holders and is awaiting final approval. The
    objectors filed two class action complaints styled Sharon
    Taylor, et al. v. Biometric Access Company et al. and
    Sharon Taylor, et al. v. Acxiom et al. in the
    U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
    alleging similar violations of the DPPA. The Acxiom action is
    filed against eFunds subsidiary ChexSystems, Inc., while the
    Biometric suit is filed against Certegy Check

    action based upon the earlier settlement which was granted. The
    action against Certegy Check Services, Inc. was voluntarily
    dismissed in February of 2008.

Employee
    Data Theft

On July 3, 2007, the Company announced that a database
    administrator had misappropriated consumer information. To date,
    the Company has seen no evidence of the stolen information being
    used for anything other than marketing purposes. Nevertheless,
    multiple putative class action lawsuits were filed against the
    Company seeking monetary damages. Those class actions were
    settled in January of 2008. In February of 2008, the court
    indicated that preliminary approval of the settlement would be
    granted, but a formal written order has not yet been entered.

Indemnifications
    and Warranties

The Company often indemnifies its customers against damages and
    costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, or trademark
    infringement associated with use of its software through
    software licensing agreements. Historically, the Company has not
    made any payments under such indemnifications, but continues to
    monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications
    to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and
    would recognize any such losses when they are estimable. In
    addition, the Company warrants to customers that its software
    operates substantially in accordance with the software
    specifications. Historically, no costs have been incurred
    related to software warranties and none are expected in the
    future, and as such no accruals for warranty costs have been
    made.

As a condition to the FNT Distribution, Old FNF received a
    ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and an opinion from a
    nationally recognized accounting firm, together to the effect
    that the FNT Distribution would be tax free for both Old FNF and
    the stockholders of Old FNF under Section 355 and related
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The FNT Distribution
    would become taxable to Old FNF (and to the Company, its
    successor after the FNF Merger) pursuant to Section 355(e)
    of the Internal Revenue Code if 50% or more of the shares of
    either Old FNF common stock (taking into account the
    Company’s common stock, as successor to Old FNF after the
    merger) or 50% or more of the FNT common stock were acquired,
    directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related
    transactions that included the FNT Distribution. Because the Old
    FNF stockholders owned more than 50% of the Company’s
    common stock following the FNF Merger, the merger, standing
    alone, would not cause the distribution to be taxable to Old FNF
    under Section 355(e). However, if the Internal Revenue
    Service successfully asserted that acquisitions of Old FNF
    common stock or the Company’s common stock, either before
    or after the distribution, were part of a plan or series of
    related transactions that included the FNT Distribution, such
    determination would likely result in the recognition of gain by
    Old FNF under Section 355(e) taking into account that the
    merger resulted in an acquisition of approximately 49% of the
    stock of the Company pursuant to a plan that includes the FNT
    Distribution. Under tax disaffiliation agreements executed by
    the parties, FNT would generally be required to indemnify the
    Company (as successor to Old FNF after the merger) against
    tax-related losses to the Company that arise if the distribution
    were to become taxable under Section 355(e). However, the
    Company would be required to indemnify FNT if the Company had
    taken certain actions within its control that caused the FNT
    Distribution to be taxable. If Section 355(e) were to cause
    the FNT Distribution to be taxable to Old FNF and indemnifiable
    by FNT or the Company, the FNT Distribution would remain tax
    free to Old FNF’s stockholders, assuming the other
    requirements of Section 355 were otherwise satisfied.

Escrow
    Arrangements

In conducting title agency, closing and 1031 exchange services
    operations, the Company routinely holds customers’ assets
    in escrow, pending completion of real estate transactions.
    Certain of these amounts are maintained in segregated bank
    accounts and have not been included in the accompanying

    banks. There were no loans outstanding as of December 31,
    2007 and these balances were invested in short term, high grade
    investments that minimize the risk to principal.

Leases

The Company leases certain of its property under leases which
    expire at various dates. Several of these agreements include
    escalation clauses and provide for purchases and renewal options
    for periods ranging from one to five years.

Future minimum operating lease payments for leases with
    remaining terms greater than one year for each of the years in
    the five years ending December 31, 2012, and thereafter in

In addition, the Company has operating lease commitments

    which renew on a short-term basis.

Rent expense incurred under all operating leases during the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $106.4 million, $81.5 million and $61.1 million,
    respectively.

Data Processing and Maintenance Services
    Agreements.

The Company has agreements with
    various vendors, which expire between 2008 and 2017, for
    portions of its computer data processing operations and related
    functions. The Company’s estimated aggregate contractual
    obligation remaining under these agreements was approximately
    $888.3 million as of December 31, 2007. However, this
    amount could be more or less depending on various factors such
    as the inflation rate, the introduction of significant new
    technologies, or changes in the Company’s data processing
    needs.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Stock
    Purchase Plan

Prior to the Certegy Merger (Note 6), FIS employees
    participated in the Fidelity National Financial, Inc. Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Subsequent to the Certegy Merger,
    the Company instituted its own plan with the same terms as the
    Fidelity National Financial, Inc. plan. Under the terms of both
    plans and subsequent amendments, eligible employees may
    voluntarily purchase, at current market prices, shares of
    FNF’s (prior to the Certegy Merger) or FIS’s (post
    Certegy Merger) common stock through payroll deductions.
    Pursuant to the ESPP, employees may contribute an amount between
    3% and 15% of their base salary and certain commissions. Shares
    purchased are allocated to employees based upon their
    contributions. The Company contributes varying matching amounts
    as specified in the ESPP. The Company recorded an expense of
    $15.2 million, $13.1 million and $11.1 million,
    respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005 relating to the participation of FIS employees in the
    ESPP.

401(k)
    Profit Sharing Plan

The Company’s employees are covered by a qualified 401(k)
    plan. Prior to the Certegy Merger, this plan was sponsored by
    FNF. Eligible employees may contribute up to 40% of their pretax
    annual compensation, up to the amount allowed pursuant to the
    Internal Revenue Code. The Company generally matches 50% of each
    dollar of employee contribution up to 6% of the employee’s
    total eligible compensation. The Company recorded
    $20.3 million, $19.0 million and $15.7 million,
    respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005 relating to the participation of FIS employees in the
    401(k) plan.

Stock
    Option Plans

In 2005, the Company adopted the FIS 2005 Stock Incentive Plan
    (the “Plan”). As of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    there were 2,554,373 and 6,726,667 options outstanding under
    this plan, respectively, at a strike price of $15.63 per share
    (as adjusted for the .6396 exchange ratio in the Certegy
    transaction). These stock options were granted at the fair value
    of the Company’s stock on the grant date based on the price
    for which the Company sold 32 million shares (a 25%
    interest) to the financial sponsors in the recapitalization
    transaction on March 9, 2005. The Plan provides for the
    grant of stock options and restricted stock, representing up to
    10,371,892 shares. The options granted thus far under this
    plan have a term of 10 years and vest over either a 4 or
    5 year period (the “time-based options”) on a
    quarterly basis or based on specific performance criteria (the
    “performance-based options”). The time-based options
    vest with respect to


/


or


/


of the total number of shares subject to such time-based options
    on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The performance-based
    options vest for certain key employees in the event of a change
    in control or after an initial public offering solely if one of
    the following targets shall be met: (a) 50% of the total
    number of shares subject to such performance based options vest
    if the public trading value of a share of common stock equals at
    least $27.36 and (b) 100% of the total number of shares
    subject to such performance based options will vest if the
    public trading value of a share of common stock equals at least
    $31.27, provided the optionee’s service has not terminated
    prior to the applicable vesting date. For the remaining
    employees, vesting of the performance-based options occurs in
    the event of a change in control or an initial public offering
    and if the public trading value of common stock equals at least
    $31.27 provided the optionee’s service with FIS has not
    terminated prior to the applicable vesting date.

Through the Certegy Merger, the Company assumed the Certegy Inc.
    Stock Incentive Plan that provides for the issuance of qualified
    and non-qualified stock options to officers and other key
    employees at exercise prices not less than market on the date of
    grant. All options and awards outstanding prior to the Certegy
    Merger under the Certegy Plan were fully vested as of the
    Certegy Merger date. As part of the Certegy Merger, the Certegy
    shareholders approved amendments to the plan and approved an
    additional 6.0 million shares to be made available under
    the plan. During the year ended December 31, 2007 and the
    period from February 1, 2006 through December 31,
    2006, the Company granted 4,735,500 and 4,693,000 options under
    this plan, respectively. There were 11,412,777 and 7,773,588
    options outstanding under this plan at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively.

On November 9, 2006, as part of the closing of the FNF
    Merger, the Company assumed certain options and restricted stock
    grants that the Company’s employees and directors held in
    FNF under certain FNF stock option plans. The Company assumed
    2,731,770 options to replace approximately 4.9 million
    outstanding FNF options per the FNF Merger agreement. The
    Company also assumed 0.1 million shares of restricted stock.

On September 12, 2007, as part of the closing of the eFunds
    acquisition, the Company assumed certain vested and unvested
    options and restricted stock units that the employees of eFunds
    held as of the acquisition date in the eFunds stock option
    plans. The Company assumed 2,182,991 options and
    0.1 million restricted stock units.

Certain FIS employees were participants in FNF’s
    stock-based compensation plans prior to the FNF Merger, which
    provide for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock
    options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentive awards
    for officers and key employees. Grants of incentive and
    nonqualified stock options under these

plans have generally provided that options shall vest equally
    over three years and generally expire ten years after their
    original date of grant. All options granted under these plans
    have an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    underlying common stock on the date of grant. There were no FNF
    options granted to FIS employees under these plans in the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The Company recorded
    expense relating to these options and restricted stock of
    $6.4 million, $3.8 million and $15.4 million in
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. All FNF options and restricted stock for which the
    Company now records expense were converted into FIS options and

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”)
    effective as of January 1, 2006. Prior to January 1,
    2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using
    the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”) which the Company
    adopted on January 1, 2003 under the prospective method as
    permitted by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

(“SFAS No. 148”). Under this method,
    stock-based employee compensation cost was recognized from the
    beginning of 2003 as if the fair value method of accounting had
    been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified,
    or settled in years beginning after December 31, 2002. The
    Company has provided for total stock compensation expense of
    $39.0 million, $50.1 million and $20.4 million
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which is included in
    selling, general, and administrative expense in the Consolidated
    and Combined Statements of Earnings. The year ended
    December 31,2007 included stock compensation expense of
    $2.2 million relating to the acceleration of option vesting
    upon termination of certain employees during the year. The year
    ended 2006 included stock compensation expense of
    $24.5 million relating to the FIS performance based options
    granted on March 9, 2005 for which the performance and
    market based criteria for vesting were met during the period and
    a $6.1 million charge relating to the acceleration of
    option vesting per the FNF Merger agreement. There was no
    material impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R as all
    options related to the Company’s employees from FNF grants
    that had been accounted for under other methods were fully
    vested as of December 31, 2005. All grants of FIS options
    have been accounted for under fair value accounting under
    SFAS 123 or SFAS 123R.

The fair value relating to the time-based options granted by the
    Company in 2005 was estimated using a Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model, while the fair value relating to the
    performance-based options was estimated using a Monte-Carlo
    option pricing model due to the vesting characteristics of those
    options, as discussed above. The following assumptions were used
    for the 4,798,747 time-based options granted in 2005; the risk
    free interest rate was 4.2%, the volatility factor for the
    expected market price of the common stock was 44%, the expected
    dividend yield was zero and weighted average expected life was
    5 years. The fair value of each time-based option was
    $6.79. Since the Company was not publicly traded when these FIS
    options were issued, the Company relied on industry peer data to
    determine the volatility assumption, and for the expected life
    assumption, the Company used an average of several methods,
    including FNF’s historical exercise history, peer firm
    data, publicly available industry data and

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Safe Harbor approach as stated in the SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin 107. The following assumptions were used for the
    valuation of the 4,199,466 performance-based options granted in
    2005: the risk free interest rate was 4.2%, the volatility
    factor for the expected market price of the common stock was
    44%, the expected dividend yield was zero and the objective time
    to exercise was 4.7 years with an objective in the money
    assumption of 2.95 years. It was also expected that the
    initial public offering assumption would occur within a
    9 month period from grant date. The fair value of the
    performance-based options was calculated to be $5.85.

The fair value for FIS options granted in 2006 was estimated at
    the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model
    with the following weighted average assumptions. The risk free
    interest rate used in the calculation is the rate that
    corresponds to the weighted average expected life of an option.
    The risk free interest rate used for options granted during 2006
    was 4.9%. A volatility factor for the expected market price of
    the common stock of 30% was used for options granted in 2006.
    The expected dividend yield used for 2006 was 0.5%. A weighted
    average expected life of 6.4 years was used for 2006. The
    weighted average fair value of each option granted during 2006
    was $15.52.

The fair value for FIS options granted in 2007 was estimated at
    the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model
    with the following weighted average assumptions. The risk free
    interest rate used in the calculation is the rate that
    corresponds to the weighted average expected life of an option.
    The risk free interest rate used for options granted during 2007
    was 3.5%. A volatility factor for the expected market price of
    the common stock of 25% was used for options granted in 2007.
    The expected dividend yield used for 2006 was 0.5%. A weighted
    average expected life of 5.8 years was used for 2007. The
    weighted average fair value of each option granted during 2007
    was $12.60.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards is
    $123.4 million and $86.1 million, respectively, which
    is expected to be recognized in pre-tax income over a weighted
    average period of 1.8 years and 1.9 years,
    respectively.

The Company intends to limit dilution caused by option
    exercises, including anticipated exercises, by repurchasing
    shares on the open market or in privately negotiated
    transactions. On October 25, 2006, the Company’s Board
    of Directors approved a plan authorizing the repurchase of up to
    $200 million worth of the Company’s common stock.
    During 2007 and 2006, the Company repurchased
    1,633,911 shares and 4,261,200 shares, respectively,
    at an average price of $49.15 and $37.60, respectively.

Defined
    Benefit Plans

Certegy
    Pension Plan

In connection with the Certegy Merger, the Company announced
    that it was going to terminate and settle the Certegy
    U.S. Retirement Income Plan (“USRIP”). The
    estimated impact of this settlement was reflected in the
    purchase price allocation as an increase in the pension
    liability, less the fair value of the pension plan assets, based
    on estimates of the total cost to settle the liability through
    the purchase of annuity contracts or lump sum settlements to the
    beneficiaries. The final USRIP settlement occurred during the
    fourth quarter of 2007 and was paid by the participant electing
    to take a lump-sum payment of their accrued benefit or receiving
    an annuity contract for their remaining benefit. The aggregate
    settlement value was $73.5 million. In addition the Company
    amended the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”) to effectively freeze the benefits entitled
    under the plan resulting in a curtailment and settlement of that
    plan at December 31, 2007. The liabilities of that plan
    were then paid out in February 2008.

(18)  Concentration
    of Risk

The Company generates a significant amount of revenue from large
    customers, however, no customers accounted for more than 10% of
    total revenue or total segment revenue in the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
    equivalents and trade receivables.

The Company places its cash equivalents with high credit quality
    financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of
    credit exposure with any one financial institution.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
    are limited because a large number of geographically diverse
    customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus
    spreading the trade receivables credit risk. The Company
    controls credit risk through monitoring procedures.

(19)  Segment
    Information

Upon completion of the Certegy Merger, the Company implemented a
    new organizational structure, which resulted in a new operating
    segment structure beginning with the reporting of first quarter
    2006 results. Effective as of February 1, 2006, the
    Company’s operating segments are TPS and LPS. This
    structure reflects how the businesses are operated and managed.
    The primary components of the TPS segment, which includes
    Certegy’s Card and Check Services, the financial
    institution processing component of the former Financial
    Institution Software and Services segment of FIS and the
    operations acquired from eFunds, are Enterprise Solutions,
    Integrated Financial Solutions and International businesses. The
    primary components of the LPS segment are Mortgage Information
    Services businesses, which includes the mortgage lender
    processing component of the former Financial Institution
    Software and Services segment of FIS, and the former Lender
    Services, Default Management, and Information Services segments
    of FIS.

    records of their customer accounts. The Company also provides a
    number of complementary applications and services that interact
    directly with the core processing applications, including
    applications that facilitate interactions between the
    Company’s financial institution customers and their
    clients. The Company offers applications and services through a
    range of delivery and service models, including

on-site

outsourcing and remote processing arrangements, as well as on a
    licensed software basis for installation on customer-owned and
    operated systems. This segment also includes card issuer
    services, which enable banks, credit unions, and others to issue
    VISA and MasterCard credit and debit cards, private label cards,
    and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and
    business accounts. In addition, the Company provides risk
    management services to retailers and financial institutions.
    Included in this segment were $532.5 million,
    $450.0 million and $184.3 million in sales to

non-U.S. based

    outside of the United States totaling $332.1 million and
    $296.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the amount of net
    assets located outside of the United States was immaterial.
    These assets are predominantly located in Germany, South America
    and India.

Controls
    and Procedures.

As of the end of the year covered by this report, the Company
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of its principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such
    term is defined in

Rule 13a-15

(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the
    Company’s principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer concluded that its disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that
    its disclosure controls and procedures will timely alert them to
    material information required to be included in the
    Company’s periodic SEC reports.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter
    that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
    Management has adopted the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on our evaluation under this framework, our
    management concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.
    KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm
    has issued an attestation report on our internal control over
    financial reporting as set forth in Item 8.
